2026 budget was heavy on slogans but empty on substance  Davis Opoku,"The Member of Parliament for Mpraeso, Davis Ansah Opoku, has criticised the governments 2026 Budget Statement, describing it as heavy on slogans but empty on substance.
Contributing to the debate in Parliament on Friday, November 20, the Deputy Ranking Member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) argued that the budget failed to provide clear, measurable policy direction for addressing the countrys economic difficulties.
According to Opoku, the government devoted more effort to crafting catchy expressions than to outlining credible programmes that could deliver relief to households and businesses.
He stated that Ghanaians are tired of slogans that lead nowhere, adding that the budget once again repeated promises without demonstrating how those commitments would be funded or implemented.
We expected solutions, not soundbites, he remarked.
The Mpraeso MP said that beyond the messaging, the budget lacked concrete initiatives capable of stimulating growth or reducing unemployment.
He pointed out that sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and small-scale enterprises received what he described as minimal attention, despite their central role in economic recovery.
A budget must reflect urgency and seriousness. What we received instead was a document full of lofty words and empty pages, he added.
Mr Opoku further argued that the government had failed to provide a transparent account of how it intended to finance key projects, especially in the face of limited fiscal space.
He said the absence of detailed costings and timelines undermined public confidence in the administrations economic management.
Parliament cannot approve a budget that does not tell the country how programmes will be delivered or what they will cost, he cautioned.
Concluding his submission, the Deputy Ranking Member urged the government to revise the budget and present a more practical framework that responds to the needs of ordinary Ghanaians.
He insisted that the country requires a plan rooted in realism rather than rhetoric.
This is not the time for branding exercises; it is the time for action, he stressed.",,Politics, 23 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/2026-budget-was-heavy-on-slogans-but-empty-on-substance-Davis-Opoku-2010613
Where is Ken Ofori-Atta? - Afenyo-Markin questioned in Parliament,"Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin came under intense scrutiny in Parliament on Friday November 21, 2025 as MPs demanded explanations for the continued absence of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, who is expected to return to Ghana to face investigations into alleged corruption-linked contracts, including the controversial GRASML deal and the National Cathedral project.
The issue resurfaced when the Minister for Local Government, Ahmed Ibrahim, reminded the House of an earlier assurance by Afenyo-Markin that Ofori-Atta would return to the country by February 18, 2025.
He directly queried the Minority Leader for an update on the former ministers whereabouts.
He gave us authoritative information that by February 18th, the honourable former Finance Minister was going to be in Ghana. So Im asking, where is the former Finance Minister? Ahmed Ibrahim demanded.
Ministers of Finance who have occupied that office, after their tenure, remain in this country. Where is he?
In response, Afenyo-Markin rejected claims of misleading Parliament. He explained that Ofori-Atta had officially communicated to the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), through his lawyers, outlining his health challenges and travel plans.
The records will bear me out...Ken Ofori-Atta had written to the OSP that he would be in Ghana on or before May. He also indicated that he had been booked for surgery.
OSP formally charges Ken Ofori-Atta, seven others with 78 counts
He further explained that doctors later advised an extended recovery period after the scheduled procedure, leading to additional communication from the former minister seeking more time.
Afenyo-Markin urged MPs to show empathy, stressing the sensitivity of medical issues.
When it comes to ill health, all of us may go through it one way or the other. If a man is going through a serious medical condition, how many of us would be bold enough to disclose our medical records? But the man has disclosed his medical record, he said.
He warned against politicising Ofori-Attas condition, adding, Lets be fair to Ken Ofori-Atta. It can be you tomorrow.
However, Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga rejected suggestions that MPs were being insensitive. He argued that concerns about Ofori-Attas health only became pressing after he was needed to answer accountability-related questions.
You are giving the impression that members on this side are insensitive to the medical condition of Ken Ofori-Atta...Ken Ofori-Atta was very sick in this country. You could see the sickness in his face. But at that time, it was sweet to be a Finance Minister.
He continued, How come that suddenly, because today he is being sought after by the law enforcement agencies, he cannot live in this country and is claiming illness? He was sick when he was the Finance Minister. We all saw it.
The former Finance Minister was invited by the OSP earlier this year to provide evidence or respond to allegations surrounding the GRASML revenue assurance contract and other public expenditure issues. His prolonged stay abroad has since become a major point of contention.

Several pages of my memoir will be for 'Prime Minister' Gabby Otchere-Darko - Afenyo-Markin,"The Minority Leader of Parliament,
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
, has hinted that several pages of the memoir he plans to write in the future will be dedicated to New Patriotic Party (NPP) stalwart, Gabby Otchere-Darko.
According to him, Gabby whom he referred to as Prime Minister is one of the few people within the party who sat him down and advised him during some of the lowest moments of his life.
Speaking in an interview on Asasepa, shared on social media, Afenyo-Markin explained that during the early years of the previous NPP administration, when the party recaptured power from the then
National Democratic Congress
(NDC), he felt neglected because he was not rewarded with any position or appointment.
He added that despite being a long-standing Member of Parliament for the Effutu Constituency in the Central Region, he was not given any parliamentary committee leadership role, even though new entrants secured such positions.
Look, God has planned everything. For me to even be here, I never dreamt of becoming a Whip, then a Deputy Leader and eventually the Leader of the Minority.
Your boss, Gabby Otchere-Darko, aka Prime Minister, the day I write my memoir, I will dedicate several pages in his honour, he said.
There have been attempts to remove Afenyo-Markin from leadership - Kwesi Pratt alleges
We fought hard to win power and when they shared the positions, I didnt get any. Even in Parliament, I didnt get committee leadership but newcomers were made committee leaders. We went through trials but people like Gabby sat me down and said, Alex, how old are you? You are in your 30s. Go and work hard and pray. Politics is always like that.
He noted that Gabbys advice encouraged him to stay focused and work harder, ultimately contributing to his rise as Minority Leader.

No proxy voting in 2026 NPP presidential primaries  Election Committee reaffirms ban,"The decision was confirmed after a closed-door meeting between the partys Presidential Election Committee and all aspirants in Accra.
Chairman Joseph Osei Owusu said the committee carefully considered concerns raised about the ban but concluded that allowing proxy votes could compromise the transparency and credibility of the election.
Weve read the petitions presented by sections of the party. And after listening to all that, we came to a conclusion that for the sake of conducting an election that is incident-free, an election that is respected, an election in which its accessible to all, a very credible election, that provision or that ban should be maintained, Osei Owusu told journalists.
We will still not have proxy voting in the 2026 presidential primaries.
Under this directive, all registered delegates must be physically present at their designated polling centres to cast their votes.
To enhance transparency, the committee provided each aspirant with soft copies of the provisional voters register.
Osei Owusu urged candidates to carefully review the document and submit any corrections through the official channels before it is publicly displayed at the constituencies.
The issue of proxy voting had resurfaced after some members argued that the ban could disenfranchise delegates who might be away on official duties, ill, or otherwise unable to attend on election day.
However, the committee maintained that physical presence is crucial for a credible and incident-free election.
Osei Owusu described the meeting as productive and peaceful, emphasizing the committees commitment to ensuring a transparent electoral process in the lead-up to the 2026 NPP presidential primary.",,Politics, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/No-proxy-voting-in-2026-NPP-presidential-primaries-Election-Committee-reaffirms-ban-2010510
Abu Jinapor outlines 5 reasons why Bawumia remains the best man for NPP,"Member of Parliament for Damongo and former lands and natural resources Minister,
John Abdulai Jinapor
has made a compelling case for the retention of former Vice President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, as the flagbearer of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) for the 2028 election.
In an interview with Paul Adom Otchere on Good Evening Ghana on Thursday, November 20, 2025, the MP said he decided to remain supportive of Dr Bawumias candidature after a careful assessment of the situation the NPP finds itself in, as well as messages of all the aspirants.
NPP Primaries: Dr Bawumia receives widespread endorsements in Central Region
""I have listened carefully to each one of the Presidential candidates. They are people I know very well at the personal level, and I have listened to all of them carefully, and I have not been convinced as to why we should not present
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
. I don't have any credible and compelling reason why we should change
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
,"" he said.
He then gave a number of reasons why he believes Dr Bawumia is the best person to lead the NPP to victory in 2028, urging the party to rally behind him, just as both the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and NPP did for the late Prof Mills, Nana Akufo-Addo and John Dramani Mahama.
""He is well marketed, he is formidable, he is credible, he is somebody you cannot associate with anything corruption or incompetence.""
""And I believe that if we present him again for 2028 and we rally behind him, I believe he has a very great, strong chance of winning the 2028 elections,"" Abu Jinapor added, reiterating his belief that the NPP will elect him as its presidential candidate.
22 out of 25 Assin South electoral area coordinators declare support for Dr Bawumia
""I am convinced that the party will support him come January 31, 2026, and I am convinced that the party will elect him because the party wants to win the 2028 election.""
""And I am convinced and that is the sentiment within the party that
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
is the man who is the most formidable, the most marketed, a string candidate and has a national appeal. We have taken him once and if take him again and rally behind him in 2028, I believe that by the grace of the Almighty God, the Ghanaian people will have favour with us and elect him as President of Ghana come 2029.""
Jinapor's final reason was history, adding that over the years, both the NPP and the NDC have consistently backed presidential candidates over and over until they emerged Presidents.
He cited John Evans Atta Mills, Nana Akufo-Addo and President Mahama, who were all presented a number of times before they eventually won.

Parliament

, and the Minority Leader, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, clashed over the continued absence of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, who is expected to return to the country to face investigations into alleged corruption-linked contracts, including the GRASML deal and the National Cathedral project.
OSP formally charges Ken Ofori-Atta, seven others with 78 counts
The exchange began when the Minister of Local Government, Ahmed Ibrahim, reminded the House of an earlier assurance from the Minority Leader that the former minister would return to Ghana by February 18, 2025.
He pressed for an update, questioning why Ofori-Atta had still not appeared.
He gave us authoritative information that by February 18, 2025, the honourable former Finance Minister was going to be in Ghana. So, Im saying, where is the former Finance Minister?

Meanwhile, the OSP has announced that it will arraign eight accused persons, including Ken Ofori-Atta, before the court on Monday, November 24, 2025.
He has formally charged Ofori-Atta, along with seven other individuals, with a total of 78 counts of corruption and corruption-related offences.

The Assin zone, where Kennedy Agyapong, one of the NPP flagbearers hails from, was energised and offered Dr Bawumia a rousing welcome and endorsements.
While Assin Central, the home of Kennedy Agyapong was not as electric, Assin South and North showed up so strongly for Dr Bawumia.

"'President Mahama deserves a third term, we will test the law' - NDC's Kojo Adu Asare","A leading member of the ruling
National Democratic Congress
(NDC), Kojo Adu Asare, has asserted that President
John Dramani Mahama
should vie for the presidency for a third term.
According to him, the president deserves another term in office because the people of Ghana want him to continue to lead the country because of his good works.
Kojo Adu Asare, a former Member of
Parliament
(MP) for Adentan, who made these remarks in a recent interview on Asempa 94.7 FM, said that the laws of the country, which border on presidential term limits, will be tested.
Asked whether Mahama deserves another term in office, the former NDC MP said, I think so.
If Ghanaians want him, why not? he added when pressed on why he was harbouring such thoughts.
He reiterated, Im saying that you talk to the people of Ghana... gauge the mood of the people and the acceptability, approval rating for John Mahama.
He suggested that President Mahamas first term in office does not count, saying that he will now be running for his second.
It is about law and we are going to law... It is about governance, and the people love someone who they think can help develop the nation.
He asserted that the president's achievement has shown that he would transform the country if he were given more time.
He added that countries like Singapore have made significant progress in their development process because they had leaders who were in office for longer periods.
President Mahama announces 'plans' for 2028 presidential run
Meanwhile, President Mahama, in August 2025, dismissed growing speculation that he may seek another term in 2028, firmly stating that he will not contest in Ghana's next general elections.
For months, sections of the public and political commentators had suggested that President Mahama could be persuaded to run again.
But the President has now put those rumours to rest, making it clear that he has no intention of returning to the ballot, while on an official visit to Singapore.
Explaining his decision, President Mahama said stepping aside in 2028 would give him the moral authority to prioritise the national interest over electoral considerations.
""I will not be a candidate in the next elections and therefore I can hold the line when it comes to fiscal discipline,"" he said.

'This is becoming too many!' - Afenyo-Markin clashes with First Deputy Speaker,"Minority Leader
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
got into a heated exchange with the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament,
Bernard Ahiafor
, after Ahiafor interrupted him while he was speaking on the floor of the House.
Afenyo-Markin was making his submission and accusing the National Democratic Congress of double standards. He argued that when the NDC was in opposition, they criticised the Hubtel software system, yet now that they are in government, they are still using the same system.
In the middle of his point,
Bernard Ahiafor
, who was presiding as Speaker, attempted to draw his attention to something.

Afenyo-Markin was not ready to entertain that interruption. He pushed back, saying that the Majority Leader had been allowed to make his point without any interference, so he did not understand why the Deputy Speaker was interrupting him.
Afenyo-Markin raised his voice saying the interruptions were becoming too frequent and he would no longer accept them.
According to him, the Majority Leader always gets the space to speak without interruption, but when it is the Minoritys turn, the interjections start.
Mr Speaker, when the Majority Leader was on his feet, you never asked him a question. This is becoming one too many; I wont accept this. You allowed him (Majority Leader) to speak, but when it gets to us (Minority), then you start asking questions. Why didnt you interrupt him? Mr Speaker, dont do this, the Minority Leader stated.
He went on to question why the Deputy Speaker did not interrupt the Majority Leader at all but decided to do so only when the Minority Leader was speaking.
Bernard Ahiafor
, unhappy with Afenyo-Markins reaction, confronted him and demanded to know which question he had even asked.
But Afenyo-Markin stood his ground and insisted that unlike with the Majority Leader, the Deputy Speaker had interrupted him, and that was exactly his problem.

'NPP talking as if Torkornoo was their woman organiser' - Rashid Tanko Computer,"Rashid Tanko Computer, Deputy Director of Elections for the ruling
National Democratic Congress
(NDC), has criticised the New Patriotic Party (NPP) over its remarks on the removal of former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo, asserting that the process was fully constitutional and followed the same procedures employed during the previous NPP administration.
Speaking on Metro TVs Good Morning Ghana on Thursday, November 20, 2025, Tanko Computer said the NPPs attempt to politicise the matter is surprising, especially given that a similar petition against Justice Torkornoo was submitted during the tenure of former President Nana Akufo-Addo.
According to him, the earlier petition filed by Professor Kwaku Azar was also processed under Article 146 of the Constitution and referred to the Council of State.
Sacked Chief Justice Torkornoo wins key ruling against government at ECOWAS Court
He noted that after reviewing the petition, the Council of State advised the Presidency that no prima facie case had been established, leading President Akufo-Addo to dismiss it.
At that time, was it a political decision by the then Council of State and the Presidency to connive and stop the investigation of her conduct? he asked. If you say political, sometimes they talk as if Torkornoo was a woman organiser of the NPP.
Tanko Computer argued that the NDC did not attack the presidency over the dismissal of the earlier petition because it respected the constitutional process.
He emphasised that the same Article 146 procedure has been followed in the current case.
This time around, another group brought a petition. The same process triggered Article 146. The Council of State sat every single member present and agreed that the woman has a case to answer, he stated.
'No news at all' - Ayikoi Otoo says ECOWAS court's rejection of Torkornoo's request expected
He maintained that no constitutional provision or step in the removal process had been breached, adding that the NPPs reaction amounts to selective outrage.
The NPP sometimes talk as if we initiated this. We didnt. These things started under their regime. She was then the Chief Justice, he said.
Tanko Computer insisted that the removal was constitutional, objective, and procedurally sound.

'One corner Minority'  NDC MP mocks NPP's shrinking numbers in Parliament,"Member of Parliament for Sefwi Wiawso, Kofi Benteh Afful, has described the NPP Minority in Parliament as the One Corner Minority, highlighting the partys dwindling numbers in the House.
'The mighty minority can't be intimidated' - Afenyo-Markin to government
Speaking on the floor of Parliament during the 2026 budget debate on Wednesday, November 19, 2025, he said, Before I became a parliamentarian, I heard that this House had two sides, your left-hand side and your right-hand side. But ever since I came here, Ive seen a median. However, what I have seen are four connects, one of which is occupied by the NPP, which was in the previous government.
Afful took a swipe at the Minority for focusing on the distinction between economic growth and development.
Today, we are presenting a budget that is not only seeking to grow the economy but to develop it. Even though we have stepped up to grow the economy by 4.8%, Mr. Speaker, in this 4.8%, 800,000 jobs are going to be created to solve some of the problems they left behind, he said.
His comments follow the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC)s two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The NDC currently holds 184 out of 275 seats, along with four independent MPs, further strengthening its control of the legislative process. The opposition
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) holds 86 seats.

"All 47 Ashanti women organisers, deputies back Dr Bawumia ahead of NPP primaries","All forty-seven (47) Ashanti Regional Women Organisers and their deputies of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) have unanimously declared their support for Dr Mahamudu Bawumia ahead of the January 31 presidential primaries.
A vibrant scene unfolded on Monday at the campaign office of the former Vice President, where the women, filled with energy and conviction, chanted NO CHANGE! NO CHANGE! STILL MAINTAIN! amid dancing and jubilations.
According to the women Organisers, their endorsement follows deep reflection on Dr Bawumias leadership qualities, his track record of service, and his vision for Ghanas future, which makes him the best candidate to lead the party.
They described Dr Bawumia as a transformational leader, a problem-solver, and a humble statesman whose commitment to national development has remained unwavering.
The women praised his strong economic expertise, noting his role in advancing Ghanas digitalisation drive, an initiative that has modernised public services, enhanced transparency, and opened new economic opportunities for millions of Ghanaians.
They also highlighted his reputation for integrity, accessibility, and inclusive leadership, which has earned him respect across political and social divides.
Dr Bawumia is the difference the NPP actually needs
To them, Dr Bawumia represents a leader who combines intelligence with empathy, innovation with practicality, and vision with action.
Not only did they pledge their support for the former Vice President, but the energetic and vibrant women leaders also promised to work hard to garner more votes for Dr Bawumia in the Ashanti Region.
They emphasised that his calm demeanour, data-driven decision-making, and dedication to the welfare of ordinary citizens make him the ideal candidate to lead the party forward.

Electing Dr Bawumia as flagbearer will show NPP is open to all - Professor Sikanku,"Respected communications professor and political analyst, Prof. Etse Sikanku has said  that electing former former Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, as the NPP's Presidential Candidate for the 2028 elections, represents the best berth for the NPP to send the strongest signal to the nation that the party indeed is  a broad-based national coalition, and not just for an exclusive group of people, as is being erroneously portrayed.
In an analysis of the upcoming presidential primaries of the party and the recent tribal comments that have characterised the campaign, the Prof. Sikanku observed that   the NPP is at the crossroads, adding that the party needs  to demonstrate a broader appeal to all groups across the country, rather than  appearing to close  up, following recent comments by some senior members of the party in the build up to its Presidential Primaries in January.
In the past weeks, some senior members of the party, including Flagbearer aspirant, Kennedy Agyapong, have suggested that the former Vice President is not fit to lead the party due to his ""minority"" ethnic background. But the political analyst  warned against such posture, pointing out that Bawumia's election as  flagbearer, will offer the party the needed lifeline, in the face of growing extinction.
""They need to rebuild, reinvent and re-engineer their party into a broad-based national coalition, open and acceptable to all groups and stripes rather than narrow down, close-up or constrict their outlook. If numbers are the oxygen of elections, then we all know the NPP needs this lifesaver now than ever before,"" Professor Sikanku wrote.
""Dr Bawumia presents the party with a prime opportunity to embody a more open, more united, more multi-ethnic, more multi-cultural and a more collectivist minded NPP, open to people of all groups, stripes, ethnicity and lineage ready to forge ahead in unity towards a common goal of transforming the nation,"" it added.
Below is the full article:
Dr BAWUMIA is the difference the NPP actually needs.
The NPP has just come out of a debilitating, embarrassing and absolute shellacking of a presidential election. They need to rebuild, reinvent and re-engineer their party into a broad-based national coalition, open and acceptable to all groups and stripes rather than narrow down, close-up or constrict their outlook. If numbers are the oxygen of elections, then we all know the NPP needs this lifesaver now than ever before.
You may not notice it, but we have just experienced an absolute upheaval and re-calibration of our political landscape in Ghana. Choice is no longer defined by some old, time worn, emotional and sentimental feelings or attachments to tribe but by who represents the best interests of people. For the NPP to remain relevant, it must open-up. People should feel a sense of belonging not alienation from party.
Dr Bawumia presents the party with a prime opportunity to embody a more open, more united, more multi-ethnic, more multi-cultural and a more collectivist minded NPP, open to people of all groups, stripes, ethnicity and lineage ready to forge ahead in unity towards a common goal of transforming the nation. Dr Bawumia represents a great opportunity to send the strongest signal that the party is open to all and ready to embrace anyone irrespective of their tribal or ethnic heritage. This is an invisible blockade the party needs to break. It is time to do away with the politics od tribalism and division and embrace the politics of unity, diversity and harmony which will take Africa to the next level.
By electing a truly competent and experienced candidate from a non-majority group, the NPP will be sending the strongest signal that it is truly open and ready to become a real, mass based, nationally oriented party ready to embrace Ghanaians of all stripes. Of course, this selection should be based on merit and whoever has the best solutions to transform the nation or take it to the next level. A candidate with empathy, care, sensitivity to the plight of the everyday Ghanaian and a realistic roadmap for national transformation. The party must recognize that above all, its appeal to Ghanaians will be defined primarily by how their ability to proffer solutions to the plight, problems and needs of Ghanaians. Culture and ethnicity must be celebrated not denigrated. Appreciating each others heritage, ethnic diversity and cross cultural values can foster understanding, empathy and unite people towards a common cause, promote peace and enhance development.
And if there is anything the party needs more than ever, it is to shed off the tag (real or perceived) that they are an Akan based party. We are all aware this is a tag the party has struggled to shed over the years. This nation has changed. Politics has changed. And the earlier the NPP wakes up to the idea that people are choosing leaders based on who represents their best interests rather than which festival they celebrate together or ethnic ancestor they have in common, the better. The party's fidelity must be to equality, what binds people together as a nation and a set of beliefs that will transform the nation and not a fixation on what separates us.",,Politics, 19 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Electing-Dr-Bawumia-as-flagbearer-will-show-NPP-is-open-to-all-Professor-Sikanku-2010158
"Kumchacha predicts NDC victory in 2028, compares NPP to 'Genesis 11'","Prophet Nicholas Osei, widely known as Kumchacha, has predicted that the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) will win the 2028 general elections, claiming that the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) is struggling with internal confusion similar to the biblical story in Genesis Chapter 11.
He made these remarks during an exclusive interview on Journey to Heaven with host PK on Accra-based No. 1 FM.
During the discussion, PK asked Kumchacha which political party he belonged to.
The outspoken prophet made it clear that he is not aligned with any political group.
I dont belong to any party. I speak the truth. If it is black, I say black. If it is white, I say white, he stated.
When asked if he would accept a government appointment, Kumchacha noted that he would only consider a role connected to religious or pastoral affairs.
He explained that such a role would help sanitise the pastoral space, curb misconduct among some pastors, and promote discipline.
According to him, issues such as pastors giving spiritual baths to married women and other disturbing acts can be checked if the right moral structures are put in place.
God has made the NPP like Genesis 11
Touching on the internal disputes within the NPP, Kumchacha said he has granted several interviews on the matter but prefers not to mention who should lead the partywhether Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, Kennedy Agyapong, or any other contender.
However, he firmly stated that whoever becomes the NPPs flagbearer will not win the 2028 elections.
He likened the partys internal division to Genesis Chapter 11, where the people attempting to build a tower to heaven were thrown into confusion.
But he clarified that the NPPs confusion is not spiritual; rather, it is the result of their own actions and internal disagreements.
The whole party is like Genesis 11, but not spiritually.
They are doing things that bring confusion among themselves, he explained.
Bryan Acheampong has his group, Kennedy has his group, Bawumia also has his group, and they are all throwing shades at each other.
When the host asked if it was good for the party to be experiencing such internal conflict, Kumchacha responded:
If it wasnt good for them, would they be doing it?
Prophet Kumchachas remarks have since stirred conversations online, especially his bold assertion that the NDC will return to power in 2028 and his comparison of the NPPs internal struggles to the biblical story of confusion at the Tower of Babel.",,Politics, 19 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Kumchacha-predicts-NDC-victory-in-2028-compares-NPP-to-Genesis-11-2010050
Upholding suspension of proxy voting unconstitutional  NPP executives abroad petition NEC,"A group of NPP constituency executives currently based abroad has sent a strong petition to the National Executive Committee of the party, urging it to reject the cancellation of proxy voting for the party's upcoming presidential primaries, arguing that it is unconstitutional.
Many have responded angrily to the decision of the party's Election Committee, chaired by Joe Osei Wusu, not to accept proxy voting for the election of the flagbearer, describing it as a breach of the partys constitution and alien to democratic principles.
In a detailed petition to the National Chairman of the NPP, the group, made up of various constituency and polling station executives, presented constitutional arguments for the restoration of proxy voting and approval of their proxy voting requests.
""The NPP Constitution expressly provides for voting by proxy, establishing it as a valid and legitimate method for registered voters and, by extension, eligible party delegates who are unable to be physically present in their constituency on polling day,"" the group said in the petition.
""The Constitution states:
Voting by Proxy  Article 25
25(1) A registered voter who:
(a) due to ill-health will not be able to vote on polling day; or
(b) is absent from the constituency and will be unable to vote on polling day,
may apply to the returning officer or the Commission for their name to be placed on the proxy list,"" they added, urging the NEC of the NPP not to allow them to be unduly disenfranchised at a time the party is bringing all members on board to rebuild.
""In this decisive chapter of the partys journey back to government, our collective strength must come from unity, fairness, and the full mobilization of every loyal party member. Upholding proxy voting for executives abroad is not only a matter of constitutional fidelity, it is a demonstration of responsible leadership, financial prudence, and respect for the mandate given to each of us by our constituencies.""
""Allowing proxy voting ensures that no executive is silenced by circumstance or distance and reaffirms the NPPs legacy as a party that respects every voice, values every vote, and remains committed to winning power through democratic integrity.""
List of NPP members who have declared intention to lead party into Election 2028
Below is the full petition submitted by the group:
The Chairman
National Executive Committee
New Patriotic Party
Accra
Through:
The General Secretary
New Patriotic Party (NPP)
National Headquarters
Accra, Ghana
18th November, 2025
A PETITION REQUESTING APPROVAL FOR PROXY VOTING IN THE NPP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES
We, the undersigned Constituency Executives, Polling Station Executives, of the New Patriotic Party who are currently studying or temporarily domiciled outside Ghana, respectfully submit this petition for the consideration of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and the National Council.
Constitutional Basis of Our Request
The NPP Constitution expressly provides for voting by proxy, establishing it as a valid and legitimate method for registered voters and by extension, eligible party delegates who are unable to be physically present in their constituency on polling day.
The Constitution states:
Voting by Proxy  Article 25
25(1) A registered voter who:
(a) due to ill-health will not be able to vote on polling day; or
(b) is absent from the constituency and will be unable to vote on polling day,
may apply to the returning officer or the Commission for their name to be placed on the proxy list.
The constitutional language is clear and unambiguous: Being absent from the constituency is a valid and lawful ground for proxy voting. Furthermore, the Constitution outlines the procedure:
25(2)  completion of a proxy form
25(3)  endorsement and distribution of proxy copies
25(4)  verification of the applicant and proxy
25(5)  the proxys voting rights
25(6)  limitation of one proxy at a time
25(7)  applicant not voting directly once a proxy is approved
25(810)  cancellation procedures and consequences.
These provisions clearly demonstrate that proxy voting is not an exception or privilege it is a fully codified right within the Partys electoral framework.
Our temporary presence outside Ghana whether for studies, work, or family obligations falls squarely
under Article 25(1)(b):
Absent from the constituency and unable to vote on polling day.
Avoiding Unconstitutional Disenfranchisement
If proxy voting is denied to Constituency Executives abroad, it would:
Violate the spirit and letter of Article 25, which guarantees voting rights for all members absent from their constituencies.
Unfairly disenfranchise duly elected executives whose mandates remain valid and
active.
Create unequal treatment among executives based solely on geographic location,
despite equal rank and responsibility.
Undermine internal democratic participation, especially among students, young professionals, and Diaspora leaders who tirelessly promote the Party internationally.
Financial and Strategic Considerations for a Party in Opposition
The NPP is currently in opposition, and prudence demands that all party resources, individual and collective be managed strategically to maximize our chances in the next General Elections.
Forcing executives abroad to travel home solely to cast a single vote:
Requires expensive airfare, often running into hundreds or thousands of dollars per person.
Places undue financial pressure on young executives, students, and volunteers.
Diverts resources that could instead be used to: fund polling station mobilisation, support grassroots operations, finance, communications and media outreach, empower youth mobilisation, or strengthen regional campaign structures.
Allowing proxy voting is therefore not only constitutionally sound but financially prudent, enabling the Party to conserve resources for the larger mission of winning the General Election.
Our Humble Request
In light of the constitutional grounding, democratic principles, financial prudence, and strategic
considerations, we respectfully request that:
All Constituency Executives currently studying or temporarily domiciled outside Ghana, be permitted to vote through the constitutionally recognised proxy voting system as outlined in Article 25.
The party issues clear and timely procedural guidelines to facilitate the proxy process.
Constituency and Regional Secretariats be directed to assist affected executives with proxy documentation and submission.
Final Appeal
In this decisive chapter of the Partys journey back to government, our collective strength must come  from unity, fairness, and the full mobilization of every loyal Party member. Upholding proxy voting for executives abroad is not only a matter of constitutional fidelity, it is a demonstration of responsible
leadership, financial prudence, and respect for the mandate given to each of us by our constituencies.
Allowing proxy voting ensures that no executive is silenced by circumstance or distance and reaffirms  the NPPs legacy as a Party that respects every voice, values every vote, and remains committed to winning power through democratic integrity.
We therefore humbly but firmly appeal for this request to be granted in the supreme interest of the New Patriotic Party.
Thank you.

2026 Budget: GH150 million allocation for NAIMOS insufficient  Wa West MP,"Member of
Parliament
for Wa West, Peter Lanchene Toobu, has described the GH150 million allocation in the 2026 budget for the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) as insufficient.
Speaking in an interview on TV3 monitored by
GhanaWeb
on Tuesday, November 18, 2025, he said, GH150 million for NAIMOS, that is just in the budget. And Im quite sure that it is too small. Looking at the volume of what they have to do, and their mandate, Im sure in the media budget review, the Minister of Finance will do something about it.
2026 Budget: GPCL to deliver millions of free textbooks to basic schools
Toobu called for urgent action to strengthen Ghanas fight against illegal mining, widely known as galamsey.
He proposed increasing NAIMOS personnel and equipping them with the necessary tools and resources.
Raise the strength to 1,000, give them full retooling, provide enough resources, and define a clear mandate with timelines. Soldiers can be trained for war and never see battle, but the galamsey menace is destroying our country. If we want the armed forces to succeed in enforcement, we must give them the tools, resources, and a defined timeline, he stated.
NAIMOS is a special-purpose unit established under the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (MLNR) to coordinate, monitor, and lead intelligence-driven field operations against illegal mining activities across Ghana.
Public debt drops from GH726.7 billion to GH630.2 billion - Ato Forson
It serves as the operational nerve center for Ghanas fight against illegal small-scale mining and its associated environmental destruction, particularly in water bodies and forest reserves.
The unit embodies Ghanas coordinated response to the scourge of illegal mining, integrating security, environmental, and legal measures into a unified operational strategy.

Patrick Boamah rejects Minority Leader position,"Member of Parliament for Okaikwei Central, Patrick Yaw Boamah, has brushed off claims that he is positioning himself to become the next Minority Leader.
In an interview on Asempa FMs Ekosii Sen on November 17, 2025, he said he has a long-standing and close relationship with the current Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, making the rumours about him eyeing the leadership role surprising.
There is nobody in Parliament who knows Afenyo-Markin more than I do. Weve been friends for years and were still very close. We share ideas all the time, he stated.
He recalled standing by Afenyo-Markin during earlier attempts by some individuals to remove him in the 9th Parliament.
Presidential bid not my priority, NPP restructuring is  Patrick Boamah
I was one of the people who defended him when some individuals tried to unseat him. We are grooming young leaders in the party, so there was no need to change him. At that point, he hadnt even served a full year as Majority Leader before we lost the election, he said.
The Member of Parliament for Okaikwei Central stressed that his focus now is helping the New Patriotic Party (NPP) regain power, not chasing leadership roles in Parliament.
Im not interested in the Minority Leader position. We need to be strategic. What we discuss internally shouldnt be discussed outside. It doesnt help unity, he noted.
He added that keeping the caucus and its committees united is a shared responsibility as the party works toward rebuilding.
Responding to a question whether he was nursing presidential ambition, the Okaikwei central MP did not outrightly rule out that neither did he show keen interest in becoming President but explained, God has His time for everything. I am qualified to run for the presidential primaries, but I believe everything must happen at the right time, he said.
According to Patrick Boamah, his priority is helping to reorganise and strengthen the NPP as it seeks to reposition itself with policies that can move the country forward.
Were working on fixing the party. We believe we have strong policies that can help the country, he added.

PFJ machinery was diverted to NPP loyalists - MoFA official alleges,"The Head of Protocol at the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), Justice Quarm, has accused the former New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration of diverting agricultural machinery meant for smallholder farmers under the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) programme to party loyalists.
According to him, instead of distributing the equipment to farmers to improve agricultural mechanisation, much of the machinery was allegedly sold to influential figures within the party.
As a result, many smallholder farmers were left to continue working manually, despite the government investing heavily in modernising the sector.
Justice Quarm made the allegations during an interview on the Ghana Yensom morning show hosted by Chief Jerry Forson on Accra 100.5 FM on Monday, November 17, 2025.
He disclosed that several machines imported under the PFJ initiative and kept at the Ahmarhia Engineering Centre in the Greater Accra Region went missing, leaving only a small number behind.
The records showed 150 machines on paper, but only a few were available when the new government assumed office on January 7, 2025, he stated.
He noted that it took the intervention of the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Eric Opoku, with support from the Peasant Farmers Association, to put the abandoned machines to use, some of which had been left to rot.
Justice Quarm further revealed that the Ministry inherited a debt of US$300 million, including arrears owed for cereals Ghana acquired on credit from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and outstanding annual subscription fees to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
To address the debt, he said Minister Opoku initiated steps to secure funding  approximately US$1 million  for the construction of an office complex and to channel it into repayment efforts.",,Politics, 18 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/PFJ-machinery-was-diverted-to-NPP-loyalists-MoFA-official-alleges-2009896
'What the Minority Leader is doing now is not what I did; I never raised my voice' - Bagbin,"The Speaker of
Parliament
,
Alban Bagbin
, has shared details about his tenure as Minority Leader, insisting that his conduct was markedly different from that of the current Minority Leader.
According to him, his leadership style was exemplary and did not resemble the approach of the current caucus leader.
Bagbin refuted suggestions that he behaved similarly in the past, stressing that he never raised his voice on the floor of
Parliament
to make his point.
What the Minority Leader is doing now is not what I did. He has referred to you people several times, saying he took inspiration from my record. Please go and read my record. I never raised my voice or tried to show grandeur on the floor. No! he said in a video shared by TV3 on Monday, November 17, 2025.
The then Minority Leader under the JA Kufuor led government [
Alban Bagbin
] explained that he took time to study the political atmosphere and the concerns of citizens, adding that this shaped his approach to leadership.
Parliament
kicks off 2026 budget workshop with focus on economic transformation
Speaker Bagbin, however, admitted that he lost his composure on only one occasion  when then Speaker
Peter Ala Adjetey
made a personal attack on him.
I studied the ecology, the political environment. I tested the pulse of the people, and you act in line with that. I didnt do what you are doing. Anybody can go and read. Only on one occasion, when the Rt. Hon. Speaker Peter Adjetey came and read a statement attacking me personally, did I rise to give my side of the story, and he refused to allow me.
My very good friend Papa Ankoma, who was the Majority Leader then, stood up and said that once he had mentioned me specifically, the standing orders gave me the right of reply. But the Speaker shouted at him, ordered him to sit down, and prevented me from responding, he recounted.
Alban Bagbin
added that although he was denied the opportunity to speak, he staged a one-man protest by walking out of the chamber, while his colleagues remained to continue the proceedings.
He said the incident gained national attention only after he spoke to the media from his office.
That day, I took my books and headed to my office. My colleagues did not follow me; they continued with their political business. It was in my office that a few cameras, led by GTV, came to ask why I had left. I explained that if this was how the Speaker intended to conduct the House, I would respond in kind. That caught the attention of the whole nation, he said.
He concluded by saying that the episode is documented in the official records and that claims equating his conduct with that of the current Minority Leader are unfounded.
That is the only instance. Later, when I met him [Adjetey] and explained that he had accused me without basis, they pleaded with me to tone down my response, which made no sense. I am saying this because many people have repeatedly claimed that I behaved the same way when I was Minority Leader. If I had, we could have turned things around within two years, and we almost won the 2004 elections.

NPP Primaries: Dr Bawumia storms Central Region to consolidate lead,"Former Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, is taking the next phase of his ""Our Journey Together"" to the Central Region, a crucial region in the 2028 NPP Primaries.
Bawumia, who has relentlessly been touring constituencies across the country, completed a tour of the Volta Region over the weekend, and has now moved straight to the Central Region, beginning  today Monday November 17, 2025.
The former Vice President began the Central Regional tour in Awutu Senya East Constituency, Monday morning, and he's also expected to visit Gomoa East, Awutu Senya West and Effutu constituencies later in the day on day one of the Central Regional tour which will take him to all 23 constituencies of the Region.
Central Region has become a region of interest in the 2028  NPP Primaries for Dr Bawumia, as it is the home region of another contender Kennedy Agyapong, who, until the latest parliament, was the MP for Assin Central.
However, ahead of the election in January, surveys have consistently projected Dr Bawumia as being ahead of Kennedy Agyapong in the Central Region - an advantage the former Vice President is seeking to consolidate with his direct visits to the constituencies.
In one of the latest polls, Global Info Analytics, in its regional analysis for the NPP election released at the end of September, Dr  Bawumia was ahead  in the Central Region, and by  57%, with Kennedy Agyapong following with at combined 32%.
With the polls being conducted when Dr Bawumia had not engaged with grassroot members of the NPP, his campaign would expect to consolidate his lead there with his charisma and direct interactions with party delegates.",,Politics, 17 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/NPP-Primaries-Dr-Bawumia-storms-Central-Region-to-consolidate-lead-2009849
"Trobu MP fires back at Kwesi Pratt, says claims of 'ignorance' are deliberate misrepresentation","The Member of Parliament for Trobu, Gloria Owusu, has issued a strong rebuttal to claims by veteran journalist Kwesi Pratt Jnr that she displayed ignorance of parliamentary procedures in her comments following the presentation of the 2026 Budget.
In a video shared on X on November 16, 2025, Pratt Jnr questioned how the MP got into Parliament, describing her remarks after the budget presentation as embarrassing and suggesting she did not understand that the budget had not yet been approved.
But in a detailed statement responding to Pratts criticism, the Trobu MP said her comments had been deliberately misunderstood and taken out of context by persons circulating a short clip of her interview.
'How did she get into Parliament?'  Kwesi Pratt slams NPP MP over budget 'ignorance'
According to her, the claims that she does not appreciate parliamentary procedure are unfair, misleading and entirely out of context.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Finance Minister has promised to abolish the COVID-19 levy twice this year, she stated, explaining that her comments were specifically about the continued application of the levy despite repeated ministerial assurances.
She noted that in 2025, the Finance Minister informed Parliament that the COVID-19 levy would be abolished after a VAT committee review  a promise that was never fulfilled, as the levy remained active throughout the year.
The MP explained that during her media interview after the 2026 Budget was read on November 13, the interviewer asked her, They say the COVID-19 levy has been abolished.
Her response, she said, was a factual clarification that as of today, the levy is still in force because Parliament has not yet passed any amendment or repeal.
This was to emphasise to the general public that announcements in Parliament do not take effect immediately. This is basic parliamentary procedure, and I have never contradicted it, she stressed.
Owusu added that the video being circulated online is only a small portion of her interview and does not reflect the full explanation she provided.
My comment simply clarified a factual point  no matter what is proposed in the 2026 Budget, the COVID-19 levy remains active until Parliament passes the necessary amendment or repeal. Announcing an intention in a budget is not the same as the levy being abolished today.
She insisted that any interpretation suggesting she is unaware of parliamentary processes is misleading and unfair.
The MP reaffirmed her commitment to providing accurate information to the public and urged commentators to refrain from twisting her statements.

(NPP) in the 2024 General Elections and former Minister for Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh (NAPO), has reiterated the need for a national recommitment to discipline as a guiding principle for Ghanas development.

He stressed that at a time when the nation is yearning for higher standards in public and civic conduct, Aliu Mahamas message rings louder than everparticularly regarding discipline on the roads, within communities, in public institutions, and in everyday civic life.
May his soul continue to rest in peace, Dr. Prempeh said, adding that Ghanaians must honour Aliu Mahamas memory by committing themselves to building a nation shaped by discipline, unity, and purpose.

"NHIA reforms are extensions of Bawumia's initiatives, not new NDC policies - Dr Ekua Amoakoh","Dr Ekua Amoakoh, Deputy Spokesperson to the former Vice-President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, has explained that claims that the ongoing reforms at the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) are brand new initiatives conceived by the current NDC administration are inconsistent with the established public record.
In a rebuttal statement, she said the Authority may be rightfully preparing its managers for a nationwide rollout.
It is important to recognize that the pillars of these reforms, the National Telehealth Program, the E-Pharmacy Policy, the Biometric Membership Authentication System (BMAS), and the Cashless Payment Solution, did not originate today.
I'm no stranger in NPP' - Dr Bawumia fires back at tribal critics
According to her, these are long-running national projects that were initiated, launched, or significantly advanced under the previous NPP government, driven in large part by the digital health agenda championed by the former Vice President
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
.
Dr Amoakoh said that although the NHIA Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Operations, Dr Senanu Kwesi Djokoto, has assured managers of a smooth nationwide rollout of these flagship reforms, it is crucial to place the initiatives in their proper historical context.
She explained that the reforms being highlighted are not fresh concepts conceived by the present administration; they are continuing projects whose foundations were laid years ago by the digital Dr Bawumia.
National Telehealth Project
On the National Telehealth Program, Dr Amoakoh explained that any attempt to present it as a new NDC initiative collapses under the weight of verifiable public records.
She recalled that the project was one of the most visible pillars of the NPP governments digital health agenda and was officially launched by Dr. Bawumia on 13 November 2024.
Dr Amoakoh noted that the NHIAs own official communication in 2024 explicitly described the telehealth service as a national digital health project rolled out under the leadership of Dr Bawumia and the then NHIA Chief Executive, Dr. Da-Costa Aboagye.
She explained that it was introduced as a direct extension of the governments ongoing push to modernize healthcare following the medical drone delivery system, the E-Pharmacy platform, and the broader suite of digital health reforms.
Dr Amoakoh recalled that during the launch at Ejisu in the Ashanti Region, Dr Bawumia stated unambiguously that telehealth was conceived to bring medical consultations into the homes and hands of our people, positioning it as part of the NPP governments commitment to digital transformation.
She further noted that Dr Bawumia laid out the vision: connecting every government health facility nationwide, ensuring equitable access regardless of location, and building a digitally driven, inclusive healthcare system.
Dr Amoakoh added that the next phasethe establishment of virtual care booths and community-level diagnostic points across the country, an NHIA-Ghana Health Service Pharmacy Council collaboration already in motion before the change of administration.
The Deputy Spokesperson for Dr Bawumia stressed that at the same event, Dr. Da-Costa Aboagye celebrated the Telehealth rollout as a significant milestone in the NHIS forward march, detailing its capacity to bridge access gaps through text, USSD, calls, mobile apps, and web platforms.
Dr Amoakoh noted that the full functionality of real-time audio/video consultations, OPD services, and remote medical support was introduced under his leadership, not after.
Every official fact points to one conclusion. The National Telehealth Program is not a new idea. It is an NPP-era project launched, branded, and operationalised under Dr Bawumias digital health reforms. What we are seeing today is continuation, sometimes repackaged, of work completed or significantly advanced before January 2025, she emphasised.
E-Pharmacy Policy
On the E-Pharmacy Policy, Dr Amoakoh reiterated that Ghanas National Electronic Pharmacy Platform (NEPP) was conceived, developed, and launched during the NPP government.
She cited the official launch on 18 July 2022, officiated personally by Dr Bawumia, with then NHIA CEO Dr Bernard Okoe-Boye presentclear evidence that the policy predates the current administration.
She explained that the project began in 2019 when Dr Bawumia challenged the Pharmacy Council to digitize pharmacy services. His office, she noted, provided the technical and policy support that shaped its design and implementation.
At the 2022 launch, she recalled, Dr Bawumia hailed the platform as a core component of governments broader digital health transformation.
By the time the system went live, she said, all regulatory approvals, pilots, integrations, and onboarding had already been completed under the NPP administration.
E-Pharmacy is not inherited; it is authored. Its documented history sits squarely within Bawumias digitalization portfolio, she stressed.
BMAS / MyNHIS App
On the biometric reforms at the NHIA, Dr Amoakoh insisted that both the MyNHIS App and the Biometric Membership Authentication System (BMAS) are entirely NPP-era digital innovations.
She referenced the December 5, 2022 launch of the MyNHIS App at UDS, Tamale, an official unveiling by Dr Bawumia during NHIS Active Month. The platform, she said, was fully functional at launch, allowing citizens to register, renew and link their GhanaCard using their phones.
She also recalled that the NHIA CEO at the time publicly praised the NPP government for driving the digital transformation of the scheme, even describing Dr Bawumia as the Digitization Messiah.
She noted that BMAS was already being piloted in 40 health facilities by March 2024, long before any administrative change. The project, she explained, was developed by the NHIA MIS Directorate in partnership with Margins Ghana Limited, with national rollout scheduled for mid-2024.
From conceptualisation to piloting, every stage of BMAS and the MyNHIS App occurred under the NPP government. Nothing about these reforms began after January 2025, she maintained.
NPP/Bawumia initiatives
Dr Amoakoh stated that all these reforms were launched, initiated, or significantly advanced under the previous NPP government. She explained that the timelines and public records unequivocally attribute these transformative projects to Dr Bawumias leadership.
Dr Amoakoh said that while NHIA Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Operations, Dr Senanu Kwesi Djokoto, emphasises staff preparedness for rollout, the foundation and execution of these reforms remain rooted in the NPP era.
It is undeniable that the foundation, vision, and execution of these digital health reforms are firmly rooted in the previous NPP governments leadership spearheaded by Dr Bawumia and his commitment to modernizing Ghanas health insurance system, she further added.

New Patriotic Party
legislator who fathered a child with the wife of former NADMO Deputy Director Samuel Aboagye, one of the 8 victims of the August 6, 2025, horrific helicopter crash.
Speaking in an interview on Okay FM on Friday, November 14, 2025, Sticka categorically refuted the allegation, stating that the accusations against him are just to tarnish his hard-earned reputation.
He disclosed that he will be taking steps to commence legal action against the family of the late Deputy Director of the National Disaster Management Organisation because they are allegedly behind the allegation against him.
The MP said that popular broadcaster Blakk Rasta has said that the family has told him (Blakk Rasta) that he (Sticka) had an affair with Samuel Aboagyes wife and that he is the father of their three-year-old daughter.
Im not going to talk much; I'm taking the matter to court. I was waiting for someone to make this allegation. Im going to court. Now my known brother Blakk Rasta says he has spoken to the family. I called Blakk Rasta, but I did not get him, so Im referring the issues to my lawyers, so I will take the family to court.
This matter is simply because there is DNA which can prove everything... I'm leaving everything to God, but beyond that, I will go to court, he said in the Twi dialect.

He reiterated, Im taking the family to court. They have to come and answer and prove... Im not saying Im holy; I have my faults, but if you make such an allegation against me, you are destroying my reputation.
The family of the late Samuel Aboagye took his widow, Abigail Aboagye, to the Obuasi District Court, demanding a DNA test over alleged suspicions of an affair with an unnamed Member of
Parliament
(MP) from the Ashanti Region.
According to reports, Abigail Aboagye has refused to hand over their three-year-old child for the DNA test.
Several media sources, including a statement from Nana Kwabena Gyamera Oyiakwan II, Chief of Adansi Kwapia and elder brother of the late Samuel Aboagye, allege that the widow may have had a ""close friendship"" with the said MP.
The family insists on conducting a DNA test to confirm the paternity of the child.

I seek the GS position to serve and build NPP' - Eugene Boakye,"Eugene Boakye Antwi, a former Member of Parliament for Subin Constituency and a leading aspirant for the General Secretary position of the New Patriotic Party (N.P.P.) has shared his firm convictions, unwavering loyalty and visionary agenda for the future of the party.
With years of experience in governance, policy, and grassroots engagement, Antwi stands out as a seasoned strategist with an enviable track record of service and discipline within the NPP fold.
In a statement copied to the Ghana News Agency in Accra he believed that the next phase of the partys development required strategic reorganization, principled leadership, and renewed unity, a mantra that echoes through every fiber of his political vision.
The New Patriotic Party has reached a defining moment in its history, Antwi declared with conviction. Our progress as a political tradition must now be guided by structure, accountability, and a deep connection with the ordinary Ghanaian who remains the heartbeat of our movement.
He emphasised the need for the party to remain people-centred, transparent, and forward-looking, asserting that the General Secretarys role is not merely administrative but deeply strategic  ensuring the partys stability from the grassroots to the national level.
If entrusted with this sacred responsibility, my leadership will be grounded in respect for every member, inclusiveness in decision-making, and dedication to the shared values that bind our tradition, he remarked.
The N.P.P. must be a home where every voice counts  where our strength is built on unity, not division.
Antwi also highlighted his readiness to modernize the partys administrative systems, enhance communication between the national secretariat and the constituencies and build a more dynamic youth-oriented organizational framework.
We cannot afford to run a 21st-century political movement with outdated operational methods, he cautioned.
My vision is to digitize, decentralize, and democratize our party machinery so that every constituency feels empowered and connected.
Mr Antwis calm but firm leadership style continues to inspire confidence among party faithful. His message is one of unity, renewal, and service a call to restore the partys organizational discipline and moral compass ahead of future electoral challenges.
I am not seeking power for personal gain, he concluded, but to serve to build structures that outlast individuals and ensure that the N.P.P. remains Ghanas most credible and visionary political tradition.

NPP will win 2028 presidential election; reclaim all lost seats  Okere MP,"The Member of Parliament for the Okere Constituency in the Eastern Region, Daniel Nana Addo Kenneth, has declared that the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) will win the 2028 general elections.
He stated that the party will not only secure the presidential seat but also reclaim all constituencies it lost in the 2024 elections.
According to him, God has a purpose for the NPPs inability to retain power in 2024 and the party will work relentlessly to secure victory in the upcoming polls.
While acknowledging that the 2028 elections will be challenging, he expressed confidence that the NPP will emerge victorious.
The MP made this known at Adukrom during the Arise and Build Conference organized by the Okere NPP Youth Wing under the theme: Energizing the Base for Victory 2028.
He stated that, the downfall of a man is not the end of his life, noting that the great elephant party draws inspiration from this saying.
Drawing a comparison to the Israelites, he said God has plans for the NPP, adding, We will secure victory in 2028 and win back all the seats we lost.
Addo Kenneth therefore charged the partys youth wing to unite and support the leadership to achieve a resounding victory in the 2028 polls.
He urged party faithful to put aside the disappointment of the 2024 defeat and focus on the upcoming elections, emphasising that their efforts now form the foundation for unseating the NDC.
For his part, the Constituency Youth Organizer, Daniel Abboah Osew, who spearheaded the programme, stressed the need for the youth to reorganize after every election.
He said this reorganization is crucial for mobilizing the grassroots and working toward regaining power.
He highlighted the significant role of young people in politics, stating that youth activism determines electoral success for political parties worldwide.
This, he explained, is the motivation behind the Arise and Build Conference.
Osew also commended the MP, Daniel Nana Addo Kenneth, for prioritizing youth development in the constituency, citing his initiative to sponsor 16 young people to Russia to help shape their careers and future prospects.
The Aspiring Eastern Regional Youth Organizer and current Youth Organizer for the NPP in the New Juaben North Constituency, Samuel Osei Sarkodie, popularly known as SOS, recalled that statistics from the 2024 general elections showed that many NPP youth did not participate in the voting exercise.
He said this contributed significantly to the partys worst electoral defeat.
He described the Arise and Build Conference as timely and necessary, emphasising the importance of youth involvement in reorganizing the NPP to recapture power in 2028.
In my speech, I admonished my fellow youth to be circumspect in their utterances against one another during the upcoming NPP presidential primaries scheduled for January 31, 2026. After the primaries, we must unite and work together for the party to win the 2028 elections, he added.

The 2026 Budget exposes NPPs 8 years as a period of manufacturing excuses  Sinare,"Alhaji Said Sinare, Ghanas Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and former National Vice Chairman of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC), has described the 2026 National Budget as a national resurrection while delivering a scathing critique of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP).
In a fiery statement, the NDC Zongo President said the NPPs reaction to the Budget revealed intellectual poverty and political confusion. Their commentary was so shallow that even the Budget book itself would have wept if it had ears, he said.
According to him, the 2026 Budget, presented by the Minister of Finance, is a complete departure from the chronic confusion and economic acrobatics that defined the NPPs eight years in power.
Alhaji Sinare described the Budget as more than a financial plan, it is an economic renaissance and a masterclass in governance.
He noted that while the previous administration treated Ghana as a theatre of fiscal experiments, the NDC government, led by a visionary President, has arrived with clarity, precision, and intellectual rigor.
The NPP spent years manufacturing excuses and exporting blame. Under their watch, Ghana became a spectator in global development, a nation begging for survival while drowning in reckless mismanagement. But today, the NDC has brought order to the chaos and planted a Budget that speaks productivity, innovation, social protection, and national dignity, Alhaji Sinare said.
He further stated that the 2026 Budget exposes the opposition completely.
The NPP is behaving like a political apprenticeship group shocked by the sudden return of competence. They are dancing around the Budget like confused masquerades, trying to manufacture criticisms that cannot stand under the sunlight of facts, he said.
Alhaji Sinare praised the Minister of Finance for delivering with intellectual thunder and the President for providing leadership with administrative fire.
According to him, the NDC governments budget is a stabilizer for the nation, setting Ghana on a path of production, industrial rebirth, and social protection something the NPP never understood, let alone practiced, he added.
Concluding his statement, Alhaji Sinare urged all Ghanaians to recognize the transformative nature of the Budget.
The NDC is not here to play. We are here to repair, rebuild, and reposition Ghana. And no amount of NPP lamentations can stop the rising tide, he said.", Japhet Festus Gbede,Politics, 14 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/The-2026-Budget-exposes-NPP-s-8-years-as-a-period-of-manufacturing-excuses-Sinare-2009550
"Ken Agyapong urges Akans to back his flagbearer bid, warns of becoming slaves in NPP","New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer aspirant, Kennedy Agyapong, has urged Akans particularly those in the southern parts of the country to rally behind his bid to lead the party, warning that failure to do so could render them slaves within the NPP.
Addressing delegates in Kyebi in the Eastern Region on Wednesday November 12, 2025, Agyapong veered into a tribal-toned message, insisting that Akans must support their own in the ongoing flagbearer contest.
According to him, northern political actors are uniting behind a single candidate, adding that those who refuse to align are being intimidated.
He argued that the same level of unity is lacking among Akans, whom he described as royals, cautioning that disunity could relegate them to the background in the NPP.
Let me tell you something. My grandparent told me that what is good is what is your own. Some people can unite and call someone their brother, but when it gets to our turn we fail to come together. If we remain disunited, we shall remain servants for long, he said in Twi.

He also cited comments by the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, suggesting that issues affecting Asantes should be of concern to Asantes. Agyapong insisted that similar sentiments should apply among Akyems.
I am surprised that we, the majority, sit down for the minority to discriminate against us. You go to the north and all the MPs gang up, he claimed. Tribal politics are going on and it looks like you have not seen it. The royals will soon become servants if we dont change our attitude.
Speaking in Kyebi, the hometown of President Nana Akufo-Addo, Agyapong maintained his message of unity among Akans.
In which country do you allow the minority to threaten the majority? Only in Ghana, because we dont love ourselves. Let your Akyem be of concern to you.

Let us be very careful because we are making a mistake. Some people are able to get together and say, This is our brother. But when it gets to our turn, we are not able to unite. We shall remain servants if we dont change our minds. If we remain disunited, we shall remain servants for long.

No Ghanaian youth should ever die in the pursuit of employment. We must industrialise, create sustainable jobs, and build a system that restores dignity to work and hope to our young people, he said.
The tragic event occurred during the early hours of the recruitment exercise at the stadium when a large crowd reportedly rushed the gates, triggering chaos.
The stampede led to 28 casualties, with 6 dead, 12 in critical condition and 5 injured.
Authorities have since launched an investigation and suspended recruitment activities in the region.

Why the Minority Caucus rejected Baffoe-Bonnie,"The Minority in
Parliament
rejected the approval of Supreme Court nominee Paul Baffoe-Bonnie as the next Chief Justice of Ghana.
The Minority Caucus demanded that a secret ballot be held to formally record their opposition.
During a parliamentary debate on the Appointments Committees report on Thursday, November 13, 2025, the Minority Leader, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, reaffirmed the caucuss firm position against the nomination.
Mr Speaker, we maintain our position on this nomination, and we reject same. We are going to demand a secret ballot to reject this. We are going to demand a secret ballot to vote to let Hansard record our opposition, he declared.
He further observed that some Members of
Parliament
might hold independent views and would prefer the opportunity to express them freely through a secret ballot rather than a voice vote.
Mr Speaker, we know that there are members who have their own views and would want to exercise their rights when theres a secret ballot. We, the Minority, are going to invoke that so that we take a secret ballot to register our dissent on this matter, he added.
Opposition to Baffoe-Bonnies Chief Justice bid not personal - Alhassan Tampuli
The Minoritys stance follows the Appointments Committees majority decision recommending Justice Baffoe-Bonnies approval, citing his deep knowledge of the law, judicial ethics, and his commitment to upholding constitutional principles.
Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie, who currently serves as the Acting Chief Justice, was nominated by President John Mahama to succeed Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo.
Justice Baffoe-Bonnie, who appeared before the committee on Monday, November 10, 2025, reaffirmed his readiness to lead the Judiciary into an era of renewed confidence and transparency.
The vetting began on a contentious note when Afenyo-Markin referred to him as a disputed nominee, prompting an immediate objection from the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, who argued that there was no dispute regarding the nominee before us.

Addressing remarks by Asante-Akim Central Member of
Parliament
on Thursday, November 13, 2025, Kwame Anyimadu-Antwi, during a debate on the Appointments Committee's report on Chief Justice nominee Paul Baffoe-Bonnie, stressed that no executive authority can dictate his conduct or decisions.

""The statement you just made is a very serious statement. As I sit here, theres no executive that can control me,"" he noted.
Anyimadu-Antwi had alleged that the executive was exerting undue influence over both the legislature and judiciary, citing this as a reason for the Minority's walkout during the vetting of Justice Baffoe-Bonnie.
He further argued that ongoing court cases challenging the removal of former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo made it inappropriate for
Parliament
to proceed with the vetting, claiming the executive was attempting to ""control

Minority flags alleged illegal withdrawal of GH1.4 billion from DACF account,"The Minority in Parliament has accused the Minister of Finance and the Controller and Accountant General of unlawfully withdrawing GH1.4 billion from the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF) account at the Bank of Ghana.
According to the Minority, this follows an earlier withdrawal of GHC11.3 million between February and April 2025, an act they say has undermined development initiatives at the local government level.
Speaking to the media on Thursday, November 13, 2025, Minority Chief Whip, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, called on President John Dramani Mahama to intervene immediately.
Let me thank you for responding to this patriotic call to engage you on a matter that I consider very revealing and important, Annoh-Dompreh said. If you recall, at the presentation of the first budget of this government, the Minister of Finance set out to create an impression that their government was blazing a new path, reviving hope in the district assembly concept and building capacity. Fast forward, its becoming clear that that was a deception.
Annoh-Dompreh alleged that So, what we see, whether it is connivance between the Controller and Accountant General and the Minister of Finance, is that they engage in what we call blocking and sweeping of the District Assembly Common Fund account, he said.
He provided a detailed timeline: Between February, March, and April, the Controller and Accountant General took out some GH11.3 million and GH3.2 million from the account of the Common Fund. Several complaints led to the return of GH3.2 million, but the GH11.3 million is still outstanding.
The Minority further claimed that on 4 November, the third-quarter DACF payment was released to the account, only to be blocked on 11 November. Then, on 12 November, they swept the account. The amount involved is some GH1.4 billion, Annoh-Dompreh said.
Annoh-Dompreh cited the Supreme Courts Podo ruling, emphasising that these payments are constitutional payments. Once they are done, they are not under directives. The Minister of Finance and the Comptroller cannot direct or redirect or reassign these payments. As we speak, it is clear they are micromanaging the funds of the DACF. This is totally unconstitutional.
He also warned about foreign implications, noting that some DACF funds come from international grants, including Switzerland and Germany.
The Comptroller, in cahoots with the Minister of Finance, cannot just block these accounts and sweep monies paid for specific purposes. There are implications. Funding could be withdrawn, and assemblies would suffer.
The Minority urged President Mahama to intervene, describing the alleged actions as a violation of constitutional provisions under Chapter 13. It is ironic that you are paying with one hand and taking the money with the other, Annoh-Dompreh said. This is an insult to the intelligence of the Ghanaian people.
He added that if the issue is not resolved, the Minority will raise it on the floor of Parliament under Order 93(1), framing it as a matter of public importance.
The Comptroller cannot take these actions without the blessings of the Minister of Finance. If the Minister is unaware, he will have to come and defend himself, Annoh-Dompreh added.
The finance ministry and the Office of the Accountant General have not responded to these allegations.

We support you because you are the job creator - University dons to Ken,"A group of university professors and other professionals across the country, have declared their support for Ken Ohene Agyapong to lead the New Patriotic Party.
This is not the first time university professors and professionals have openly declared their support for Ken Ohene Agyapong. The Legon Lecturers and Professionals for Ken (LLPFK), established about two years ago, has on several occasions declared Ken as the best person to lead the New Patriotic Party.
However, what happened on Tuesday November 11, 2025, was unique since this was the first time professors and professionals from the countrys major public universities, visited him at his campaign office, and reiterated their collective support for Ken Ohene Agyapong, in his bid to lead the New Patriotic Party.
Numbering about sixty, the group was drawn from professors and professionals from the University of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, University of Cape Coast, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana Technology Communication University, Ghana Maritime University and Pentecost University.
Aside the academia that was heavily represented at the meeting, other professionals represented were surveyors, engineers, registrars, architects and other senior administrative personnel from the countrys universities.
In his opening remarks, the convener of the meeting, Professor Alhassan Sulemana Anamzoya of the University of Ghana made their mission clear to Ken Ohene Agyapong.
According to him, the group was at the campaign office to show their unalloyed support to him and to express their willingness to campaign for him in any form that Ken would consider suitable.
Prof Anamzoya reminded Ken that the overwhelming support academia is giving him is on the basis of his job creation agenda.
According to him, it is disheartening for them as university professors, to see their graduates walking around the streets of Ghana looking for non-existing jobs.
""Unemployment is a major canker in Ghana. And out of all the five aspirants currently campaigning to lead the New Patriotic Party, only you, Ken Ohene Agyapong has shown to the whole world that you are a job creator and the solution to Ghanas major problem of unemployment. You have proven beyond every reasonable doubt, that you have the capacity to create jobs for both the highly educated and the less educated.
On his part, Ken Ohene Agyapong expressed his profound gratitude to the professors and professionals for their continuous support for his bid to lead NPP and eventually become President of the Republic.
He was pleasantly surprised and visibly excited to note that, the voluntary support of a small group of professors and professionals at the University of Ghana that started about two years ago, has now become a national affair, in all the countrys major universities.
The former Member of Parliament for Assin Central, reminded the university professors and professionals that his main objective of contesting to become President of the Republic, is for job creation and to apply his business ideas to ensure food sufficiency and that using the five northern regions and parts of Volta region, Ghana could grow enough food to feed the whole of Africa.
""With food sufficiency, Ghana would minimize its dependency on imported food products and by extension, minimize its dependency on the dollar to import food items into the country.
My mission is simple; jobs! Jobs!! And Jobs!!! And in creating jobs for the Ghanaian youth, we grow and process what we eat, and ensure financial discipline.
On their part, most of the professors and professionals expressed their confidence in Kens capacity to create jobs since he has done it before with his over seven thousand jobs already created through pragmatic ideas and discipline.
Other colleagues acknowledged that unemployment is a major problem in Ghana, which explains why all the five aspirants are promising the delegates of job creation, with one even promising ten employments in each of the 276 constituencies in the country.
However, none of the aspirants has been able to prove the capacity to having done so in the past nor the capability to do so in the future. Most colleagues at the meeting condemned the dishonesty of some Ghanaian politicians in promising what they cannot provide.
One key suggestion was that there should be another meeting of the university-professors and professionals on a weekend to enable the numerous colleagues who were not able to attend due to official engagements in their various universities, also participate.
Other senior campaign members present were His excellency Ambassador Ansu Kyeremeh, Ghanas former minister for land and natural resources and former Ambassador to India,  Charles Bissue, the Campaign Administrator and Dr Palgrave Boakye Danquah.
On behalf of the university professors and professionals, Professor Anamzoya expressed his gratitude to Ken Ohene Agyapong for making time to meet with them despite the short notice, and promised to continuously campaign for the success of Ken Ohene Agyapong.", Prince Adjei,Politics, 13 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/We-support-you-because-you-are-the-job-creator-University-dons-to-Ken-2009301
"NAPO mourns victims of El Wak stadium tragedy, calls for urgent reforms","Former NPP presidential running mate and former Energy Minister, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has expressed deep sorrow over the recent tragedy at the El Wak Stadium, describing it as another painful blow to the nations spirit.
The tragic incident, which occurred during a recruitment exercise at the El Wak Sports Stadium in Accra on November 12, 2025, left several young Ghanaians dead and many others injured.
The victims, mostly youth seeking enlistment into the nations security services, were reportedly caught in a stampede when the crowd surged beyond control.
In a heartfelt message shared on his official Facebook page, Dr Opoku Prempeh popularly known as Napo lamented the loss of young Ghanaians who had gathered at the stadium with hopes of serving their country, only to meet tragedy instead.
This year has brought too many painful losses to our nation and the tragedy at the El Wak Stadium deepens that sorrow, he wrote.
According to him, it is heartbreaking that young men and women simply seeking a chance to serve their country should never return home in pain or not return at all.
Dr Opoku Prempeh extended his condolences to the bereaved families and wished the injured a swift recovery.
My heartfelt condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones and my prayers are with those injured, he added.
The former minister further urged the country to take decisive steps to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.
As a nation, may we find wisdom, compassion and urgency to make reforms that ensure such tragedies never happen again, he concluded.
The post, which ended with the hashtags #InHonourAndMemory, #WithOurOwnHands, #HopeForGhana, and #FaithInService, has drawn widespread attention online, with many Ghanaians sharing in his grief and calling for accountability over the incident.

'This is the best time to appoint a substantive defence minister' - Dr Ayew Afriye,"The Ranking Member of Parliaments Health Committee, Dr Nana Ayew Afriye, has stressed the need for President John Dramani Mahama to appoint a substantive Defence Minister, noting that the acting minister, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, is currently handling both the Defence and Finance portfolios, a situation he says is unsustainable.
He made this known on the Floor of Parliament on Wednesday, November 12, 2025.
""...The President who is the Commander in Chief may have to appoint a substantive Minister of Defence.Our very good friend here is acting defence and finance minister
""We can't have one ministry a casualty at the start of the year and then also along the way. I mean it's one too much for everybody. So probably this is the best time for the Commander in Chief to bring a defence ninister"", he noted.
Dr Ayew Afriye also expressed disappointment in the Ghana Armed Forces for failing to anticipate the massive turnout at the El-Wak Sports Stadium during the recruitment exercise on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, describing the resulting stampede as both tragic and preventable.
""The Ghana Armed Forces failed in their duty to assess and prepare for the public health risks associated with bringing together thousands of young people in confined spaces.
A simple precautionary measure such as stationing health officers and emergency response teams at all recruitment centres could have saved lives"", he noted.
The Member of Parliament for Effiduase/Asokore urged a thorough review of the processes that led to the tragedy, cautioned against politicizing the incident and called on the Ministry of Defence to consider compensating the families of the victims and briefing Parliament on safety measures at other regional recruitment centres to prevent future occurrences.
""I humbly submit to the acting division the acting defence minister that Minister, maybe in the compensation measure we may want to look at the families involved graciously.
""There's nothing that you do that would appease them but there is a way to get families have a sense of belonging and government being there for them for those who died, for those who had some injuries"", he added.
The stampede occurred on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, when thousands of job seekers gathered at the stadium, resulting in six confirmed deaths and several others injured. Those injured are receiving treatment at the 37 Military Hospital.

Fact Check: Ghana did not overtake South Africa as Africa's top gold producer this year,"Reports circulating on social media claim that Ghana has just overtaken South Africa as Africas number one gold producer.
However, these reports are false and originate from parody websites and unscrupulous individuals.
ANALYSIS
In 2023, Ghana overtook South Africa as Africa's number one producer of gold, following a remarkable increase in gold production from 2.82m ounces in 2022 to about 4 million ounces in 2023.
Analysts attributed the significant rise in gold production, which aided Ghana in overtaking South Africa, to the revival of two key mines, the AngloGold Ashanti Obuasi Mine and the Bibiani Mine, by the Akufo-Addo government.
Ghana has since held that title as Africa's number one gold producer, retaining it in 2024 and 2025.
In September this year, Ghanaweb reported how Ghana 'retained' its crown as Africa's largest gold producer with a total of about 4.8m ounces of gold.
VERDICT
From the facts presented, the claim and the stories being spread on social media that Ghana has just overtaken South Africa as Africa's leading gold producer this year are false.

NPP General Secretary warns self-styled pundits over fake 'Mike Ocquaye Report',"The General Secretary of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Justin Frimpong Kodua, has issued a stern warning to self-styled radio and television pundits allegedly hiding behind certain politicians to propagate falsehoods aimed at discrediting some party members and sowing disunity.
In an exclusive interview with
GhanaWeb
, the visibly angered General Secretary cautioned that such individuals will soon face the full rigours of the law for their conduct, which he described as a deliberate attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public and undermine the NPPs internal cohesion.
Through the storm, he stood: Why the NPP needs Justin Kodua for 2028
His warning follows the circulation of a viral video by Smart Ghana Update, in which two media commentators  Albert Asomani, an accountant at Kencity Media Limited, and Anthony Dadzie Nkoom  are seen quoting from what they claim to be a Mike Ocquaye Report.
The alleged document purports that some former government officials misappropriated campaign funds meant for regional operations during the 2024 general elections.
In the video, Asomani claims that the supposed report indicts several high-profile government appointees, including Dr Gideon Boako, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, Francis Asenso-Boakye, and Kwaku Ofori Asiamah, for failing to disburse funds allocated for campaign activities in their respective regions.
'Ghana's democracy being slowly poisoned by abuse of power' - NPP claims
According to the research, substantial financial and logistical resources were allocated to these individuals to strengthen the regional campaign structure ahead of the 2024 general elections.
However, concerns were raised that these resources were not adequately utilised for their intended purposes, thereby weakening the party base, Asomani alleged in the video.
The commentary took a particularly personal turn when Asomani accused former transport minister, Kwaku Ofori Asiamah, of being selfish and hoarding funds meant for the partys regional operations.
He alleged that the former ministers conduct contributed to the NPPs drop in presidential votes from 52% in the 2020 elections under
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
to 45% in 2024 under Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.
People like Kwaku Ofori Asiamah come to the region with tainted expensive cars, flaunting the partys money in their pockets, and expect polling station executives to use their own money to buy fuel, Asomani claimed.
When contacted by
GhanaWeb
for a response, Kwaku Ofori Asiamah dismissed the allegations as baseless and malicious, describing them as part of a coordinated smear campaign.
I am not surprised to hear such things from Net2 TV and its associates, he stated. But if they truly believe in the documents they are quoting and are using them to tarnish my reputation, they should be prepared to defend their claims in court.
The NPP General Secretary, meanwhile, emphasized that the party will not tolerate attempts to weaponize misinformation for personal or factional gain.
We are a party of laws and discipline. Anyone who seeks to destabilize our unity with fabrications or falsified documents will not go unpunished, Kodua warned.
He urged the public to disregard unverified materials circulating online, stressing that the so-called Mike Ocquaye Report being referenced in the viral video does not exist within the partys official records.
Meanwhile,
GhanaWeb
has learnt that all those former appointees mentioned in the videos have threatened to go to court.

Paul Yandoh runs to Lordina to beg President Mahama over Wontumi's verbal attacks,"The Ashanti Regional Communications Director of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Paul Yandoh, has appealed to President
John Dramani Mahama
to pardon the Ashanti Regional Chairman of the NPP, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, popularly known as Chairman Wontumi, for any offence he may have committed against him.
According to Yandoh, Chairman Wontumi may have gone overboard in some of his utterances about the president.
He described Wontumis comments as unfortunate but noted that they were made in the heat of political discourse.
He therefore pleaded with President Mahama to temper justice with mercy and consider Wontumis statements as mere political talk rather than a personal attack.
Speaking in an interview on Okay FM on November 11, 2025, Yandoh further disclosed that he plans to lead a delegation to meet the wife of the president, Mrs Lordina Mahama, to plead on behalf of Chairman Wontumi for forgiveness, especially in light of his ongoing trial.
We accept that sometimes Chairman Wontumi goes overboard. Even President Mahama, during campaign times, said a lot of things.
Court rescinds arrest warrant for Chairman Wontumi
Recently, the MP for Awutu Senya East claimed that people had killed two of her followers, which turned out to be false. So, President Mahama, sometimes we all say things that may come across as personal. We apologize for that and plead with you to forgive Chairman Wontumi, he said.
We also want to know someone close to President Mahama whom he values deeply so we can reach out to the person to apologize.
His wife, Mrs Lordina Mahama, is one of such people, so we will try to contact her and apologize on behalf of Chairman Wontumi, Yandoh added.
Chairman Wontumi is currently facing charges related to alleged mining activities in forest reserves, among other offences.

Kofi Jumah further noted that he is, however, open to offering free advice to government appointees and the party.
If you come for advice, I will give it to you for free. I dont need to open a consultancy company. Where I have gotten to, all I need is to be relaxing at a beach where a young lady is rubbing her hands around my head while Im sipping a cocktail, he added.

s unwavering respect for the Judiciary as a coequal arm of government under Article 125, Clause 1 of the 1992 Constitution, which vests the judicial power of Ghana in the Judiciary. The Judiciary is independent of control or direction from any person or authority.
""The doctrine of the separation of powers requires that all three arms of government, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary, relate to one another with mutual respect and restraint, the Speaker noted.
Why Speaker Bagbin has apologised to the Judiciary
During the vetting there was a heated confrontation between the Minority Leader, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin and the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga.
Tensions escalated when Afenyo-Markin described Justice Baffoe-Bonnie as a disputed Chief Justice nominee,.

Why Speaker Bagbin has apologised to the Judiciary,"The Speaker of Parliament,
Alban Bagbin
, has apologised to the Judiciary following heated exchanges between two leaders of the House during the vetting of Chief Justice nominee, Paul Baffoe-Bonnie, on Monday, November 10, 2025.
Delivering a statement in Parliament House on Tuesday, November 11, 2025, he reiterated Parliaments respect for the Judiciary as a coequal arm of government under the 1992 Constitution.
Chaos in Parliament: We must stay resolute in service to Ghana  Bernard Ahiafor
I extend our deepest apologies and assurances of Parliaments continued respect for the Judiciary and its esteemed members. Parliamentary rules caution members against imputing improper motives or using words that are disrespectful or likely to cause offence. The Standing Orders serve as a reminder that our proceedings must always reflect the dignity and integrity of Parliament as a key organ of state.
I wish to reaffirm Parliaments unwavering respect for the Judiciary as a coequal arm of governance under Article 125(1) of the 1992 Constitution, he said.
Speaker Bagbin also urged Members of Parliament to uphold the doctrine of separation of powers, which requires the three arms of government to interact with mutual respect.
Bernard Ahiafor's cryptic post that sparked debate after chaotic CJ vetting
I will come back on this issue of decency, discipline, and decorum, and this time, I am coming with the hammer, not the gavel, he noted.
Tensions flared at the Appointments Committee sitting on Monday, November 10, 2025, as the Minority and Majority clashed over the content and limits of opening remarks during the vetting of the Chief Justice nominee.
The Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, in his opening statement on behalf of the caucus, described Baffoe-Bonnie as a disputed nominee, arguing that the process leading to the nomination raised constitutional and institutional concerns.
His remarks were challenged by the Majority Leader,
Mahama Ayariga
, who stated that the term disputed nominee violated Order 123(5), which bars members from revisiting matters already decided by the House.

'You can't stop galamsey if miners earn more than minimum wage'  Ama Daaku,"Lecturer at the University of Professional Studies Accra (UPSA) and Aide to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, Ellen Ama Daaku, has said that illegal mining, popularly known as galamsey, cannot be stopped if the operators are earning more than the minimum wage set by the government.
In a discussion on the Angel Morning Show (AMS) on Monday, November 10, 2025, she stressed that if the government wants to curb galamsey, the minimum wage should be increased.
She explained that a rise in the minimum wage would empower galamsey operators to abandon illegal mining and secure better employment, as they would earn decent wages.
How do you expect people involved in galamsey to stop if theyre earning 300 cedis a day while the minimum wage is 21 cedis a day? increase the wage, if you want them to stop, she added.
According to her, the fight against galamsey is being handled in isolation, implying it should be considered within the current economic conditions and their impact on people.
We should weave the galamsey fight into the current situation and its impacts on people, she said.
Ellen Daaku further pointed out that its tough for young people to survive on 700 cedis a month when their peers are earning more from galamsey, stating that such a person would also be tempted to join in order to survive.",,Politics, 11 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/You-can-t-stop-galamsey-if-miners-earn-more-than-minimum-wage-Ama-Daaku-2008974
Ken Agyapong cries foul as Bryan Acheampong's financial power shifts NPP race,"The New Patriotic Partys (NPP) upcoming presidential primaries appear to be taking a dramatic turn as outspoken flagbearer hopeful, Kennedy Ohene Agyapong, finds himself battling a new wave of financial influence  this time, from
Bryan Acheampong
, who is fast emerging as the partys new money magnet.
In what political watchers describe as a passionate but frustrated outburst on VOV Radio in the Hohoe Constituency of the Volta Region, Agyapong urged delegates to reject what he called money politics and instead vote for a leader genuinely concerned about their welfare.
When we were begging for five hundred Ghana cedis, where were they? When we didnt have cars as late as May 2016, where were these rich people in the NPP? Those giving you money today will abandon you after the election,
Agyapong lamented.
The maverick MP, known for his blunt talk, further appealed to delegates  especially in the Volta Region  to look beyond short-term financial temptations and consider their long-term future.
He claimed to have acquired over 60,000 hectares of land in the region to create employment opportunities as proof of his genuine commitment to their wellbeing.
However, political observers note that Agyapongs latest remarks reflect a growing unease within his campaign, as
Bryan Acheampong
, a relatively new entrant in the flagbearer race, continues to flex his financial strength across constituencies.
Once celebrated as the NPPs symbol of wealth and independence,
Kennedy Agyapong
now appears to be on the receiving end of the very money politics he once seemed to dominate. With reports of heavy cash distribution at campaign events, his moral appeals may be struggling to compete with the sound of cedi notes changing hands.",,Politics, 11 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Ken-Agyapong-cries-foul-as-Bryan-Acheampong-s-financial-power-shifts-NPP-race-2008972
Who gave you power to decide which words MPs can use?  Minority blasts Ayariga,"The Legal Counsel for the Minority Caucus in Parliament, John Darko, has slammed the Majority Leader in Parliament,
Mahama Ayariga
, questioning his actions and behavior during the vetting of the Acting Chief Justice, Paul Baffoe-Bonnie.
According to him, Ayariga is equally a Member of Parliament, just like the other committee members, raising questions about his authority to determine who spoke during the vetting, when he was not the chairman.
CJ Vetting: Read what Justice Baffoe-Bonnie said about implementing 24-hour service courts
He made this known in an interview on JoyNews on November 10, 2025, after the Minoritys boycott of the vetting.
... It's just unfortunate that when we got there, the Majority Leader decided that he would take over the job of the Chairman of Appointment Committee and decide who speaks and decide who can say what. He said that under his watch he is not going to allow the venerable Afenyo-Markin to, in his view, breach the rules.
And I'm asking myself, really, you are just an MP like us. You just happen to be a Majority Leader. Who gave you the power to decide which words to use in Parliament? Who gave you the power to decide who speaks? Who gave you the power to decide which words are right for Members of Parliament? he said fuming.
Darko, also the Member of Parliament for Suame, indicated that the Minoritys intention was to appear at the vetting and actively participate.
He added that, contrary to claims that they were unprepared due to an earlier process filed by the Minority to halt the vetting, they were in fact ready with their questions.
I think people are just speculating obviously because of all the issues but we had every intention of appearing and asking questions and so we went prepared. I had read some of the judgments of the learned Acting Chief Justice. I had seen his profile and I prepared my questions, so were my other colleagues, he added.
Darko's criticism of the Majority Leader follows a back-and-forth exchange with Minority Leader
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
, with the latter arguing that his colleague was attempting to obstruct his work.
Afenyo-Markin referred to Justice Baffoe-Bonnie as a disputed Chief Justice nominee during his introductory comments at the vetting.
We gather to vet the disputed nominee for the office of Chief Justice. This is a case of whether Ghanas judiciary will remain independent, Afenyo-Markin said.
However,
Mahama Ayariga
immediately objected to the characterisation.
I am objecting to the term disputed because there is no dispute regarding the nominee before us, he said.
He dismissed claims that the Justice Gabriel Pwamang Committee, set up by President John Dramani Mahama to investigate petitions against Justice Gertrude Torkornoo, acted improperly, stressing that all proceedings followed constitutional and parliamentary rules.
CJ Vetting: 'I will not allow you to breach an inch of the rules'  Ayariga tells Afenyo-Markin
The work of the proceedings, at no stage have you shown that the rules in the constitution governing the work of the committee, have been breached in any way. How can you come and sit here and describe the work as opaque, a travesty of justice, or an improper removal and expect me to allow that? You are clearly violating the rules. And when I try to guide you on how to go about your work, then you say that Im trying to obstruct you, Ayariga said.

Gen Z girls will vote for 'flat tummy' Ken Agyapong over Asiedu Nketiah - Naa Torshie,"Former Administrator of the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF),
Irene Naa Torshie Addo
, has hit the ground running, campaigning for the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) flagbearer hopeful,
Kennedy Agyapong
.
Speaking in a viral video clip from one of the campaign events in the Central Region, Naa Torshie said that Ghanaians have said they would vote for the NPP should
Kennedy Agyapong
be made the flagbearer of the party.
She urged the party delegates in the Central Region to vote for the former Assin Central legislator, indicating that he was one of their own.
People are saying that if you bring Ken, we would vote for you. So, what do we have to do? For the Central Region, if you vote for someone else, people will laugh at you.
Im from the Greater Accra Region, and my people and I have decided that we are going to vote for Kennedy Ohene Agyapong... what about you? she asked.
Naa Torshies working team members disown her for switching to
Kennedy Agyapong
s camp
The former DACF Administrator went on to argue that Ken Agyapong would be more appealing to the youth as flagbearer of the NPP.
She said that should the former Assin Central legislator be placed side by side with the National Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), who she asserted would be the presidential candidate of the ruling party, the youth would choose him (Ken Agyapong).
Maybe there is something you might not like about him. But when Kennedy, the man that he is, stands  a tall, nice man with a flat tummy and American English  and you look at Asiedu Nketiah with his shoulder pad, who would Gen Z girls vote for during an election? she quizzed.

'We will remove all polling station executives where Bawumia lost votes'  NPP MP,"New Patriotic Party
(NPP) Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Assafuah, has indicated that all polling station executives in areas in his constituency where the partys votes reduced in the 2024 Election will be removed.
Speaking in a viral video clip from a campaign event, Assafuah asserted that the party's presidential candidate is not responsible for maintaining the partys vote share at polling stations.
He said that it is the polling station executives who ensure that the partys votes do not decrease in their area, adding that he has instructed the NPP executives in his constituency to take note of the areas where the party lost votes.
Does Dr Mahamudu Bawumia know the Tafo polling station behind the police station? Does he know Good Shepherd? So, our votes that were reduced there, who should have ensured that that did not happen?
It is the polling station executives, right? So, yesterday, I told the constituency executives that they should look into the album for all the polling stations where our votes were reduced; we would not allow the polling station executives there to continue to be in their positions, he said.

26 out of 30 electoral area coordinators of Tarkwa Nsuaem declare support for Dr Bawumia,"Former Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumias campaign for the upcoming NPP Presidential primaries, has received a major boost with an emphatic declaration of support for him by Tarkwa Nsuaem constituency of the Western Region.
The Constituency, which has a number of 30 electoral area coordinators, had 26 of them officially declaring their support for the former Vice President.
Electoral area coordinators are vital officers in mobilising and campaigning within the NPP delagates structure and to have 26 out of 30 coordinators in a constituency openly declaring for a candidate is a significant boost.
The former Vice President, who completed a tour of the Western Region last week is currently in the Volta Region campaigning.
The results for Tarkwa Nsuaem in the 2023 NPP Presidential Primaries are as follows:
In the 2023 NPP Presidential Primaries, Dr Bawumia swept the votes in the constituency by getting 862 votes, representing 72.87%, while Kennedy Agyapong placed second with 317 votes, representing 26.7%.

Retaining Bawumia as 2028 flagbearer is consistent with precedence - Volta Regional NPP Chairman,"Volta Regional Chairman of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Makafuo Woanyah, has made a strong case for members of the NPP in the region and across the country to retain former Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia as the party's flagbearer for the 2028 elections.
Addressing NPP stakeholders in Hohoe on November 10, 2025, during the opening day of Dr Bawumias campaign tour of the Volta Region, the Volta Regional Chairman Dr Bawumia is the best among the five aspirants for the NPP flagbearership and retaining him will be in like with political marketing and consistent with the partys tradition of retaining its flagbearers to help them win the Presidency.
""In the political market, there are rules. And the rule is evident in Ghana that consistency is the key. We've seen it with NDC and we've seen it with NPP. That when you take a product to the market and that product is not bought, repeat that product and it will be bought,"" Chairman Woanyah said.
""The precedent is there, it is clear. President Kufuor went two times and we got it. President Akufo-Addo went three time and we got it.""
Beyond the NPP, the Volta Regional Chairmen also referred to the multiple times both John Evans Atta Mills and John Mahama attempted the Presidency before they eventually won.
""Mahama went three times and he got. The previous one was because President Mills died and with the mourning and sympathies, he got it (in 2012).  But when he came in 2016 he lost. They repeated him in 2020, he lost. Then he came back in 2024.""

Bernard Ahiafor's cryptic post that sparked debate after chaotic CJ vetting,"The Chairman of Parliaments Appointments Committee, Bernard Ahiafor, stirred public conversation after posting a cryptic message on social media amid the committees indefinite recess on Monday, November 10, 2025, following heated disagreements between the Majority and Minority leaders during the vetting of Chief Justice nominee, Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie.
The vetting process descended into controversy after the Minority Caucus announced its decision to reject Justice Baffoe-Bonnies nomination and boycott the proceedings entirely.
Tensions flared during the sitting as Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin and Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga engaged in a prolonged exchange, prompting a temporary suspension of proceedings for about 30 minutes.
When the committee reconvened, Afenyo-Markin announced that the Minority Caucus would abstain from participating in the vetting, leading his members to walk out.
This left only the Majority side of the Appointments Committee to continue with the process.
Shortly after the chaotic session, Committee Chairman Bernard Ahiafor took to social media to share what many have described as a veiled commentary on the days events.
Chaos in Parliament: We must stay resolute in service to Ghana  Bernard Ahiafor
He wrote, Never honour a fight on your father's farm, when you know so well that it's your father's crop that will be destroyed.
The message quickly generated reactions, with users attempting to interpret its meaning in the context of the parliamentary standoff.
One commenter replied, Not when the intruder is already destroying my father's crops. The cutlass at the farm is a tool to curb rodents at the farm!
Another added, In other words, if two elephants are fighting, its the ground that suffers.
Others took a more reflective tone, suggesting that the post was an indirect message to the feuding leaders.
Mr Chairman has chosen Facebook to indirectly advise his colleague instead of calling him aside during the recess, one user remarked.
I think the Majority Leaders interventions during the Minority Leaders presentation became unnecessary at a point. He should have allowed him to flow and then responded afterward.

"Ken Agyapong calls for disciplined, business-minded leadership to transform Ghana","Businessman and presidential hopeful Ken Ohene Agyapong has called for a new era of disciplined and decisive leadership to move Ghana forward, arguing that only a results-driven and business-minded approach can rescue the nations struggling economy.
Speaking during his Unity Tour in the Volta Region, Agyapong compared the growing admiration Ghanaians have expressed for the leadership style in Burkina Faso, highlighting the need for similar firmness and discipline in Ghanas governance.
Ghanaians are always making reference to Burkina Faso because their leader is instilling discipline in his people. That tells us something  Ghana needs a disciplined leader. A businessman who can truly manage the economy with honesty and results, he said.
He emphasized that Ghanaians are no longer interested in mere political talk but are yearning for a bold, vibrant, and truthful leader who will speak plainly and act decisively.
When its yes, Ill say yes. When its no, Ill say no. Thats the kind of leader Ghanaians want. Ive been bold to speak against the wrongs, and thats why some at the top dont like me. But I will always stand for the truth, he declared.
Agyapong, known for his straightforwardness and entrepreneurial success, urged delegates and citizens not to be deceived by temporary handouts or political gimmicks, but to vote for a leader with a proven track record in business and job creation.
Im not tribalistic; Im not sectional. Im a businessman who invests where I believe in the people. Those who come with money today will give the same to another candidate tomorrow. Thats the deception holding us back, he cautioned.
He concluded with a rallying call for Ghanaians to embrace a new model of leadership  one rooted in productivity, accountability, and economic empowerment.
Im coming with business, business, and more business. Lets build a disciplined, productive, and prosperous Ghana together, he affirmed, drawing applause from the delegates.

'I will be surprised if you still don't understand the rules' - Ayariga to Afenyo-Markin,"The Majority Leader
Mahama Ayariga
has accused the Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo Markin of pretending not to know or understand the dictate of the standing orders, the rules and regulations guiding proceedings in Parliament.
The confrontation occurred during a session of Parliaments Appointments Committee, where tensions rose over remarks made by the Minority Leader, which Ayariga described as improper and contrary to parliamentary rules.
Visibly agitated, the Majority Leader accused his counterpart of disregarding the standing orders of Parliament and misrepresenting the work of the committee.
Mr Chairman, if the Minority, led by the Minority Leader, were to walk out of here and invite all the journalists, they could describe the work of the committee in any language. Freedom of speech. But before this committee of Parliament, the rules are clear what you can raise, what you cannot raise and how you can raise it, Ayariga stated.
He added that he found it surprising that, after several years in Parliament, the Minority Leader still appeared not to understand the procedural rules governing committee sittings.
I will be surprised if after all these years in this Parliament, you dont understand those rules. Yes, I intend to be offensive because he has told me that I am here to deliberately obstruct the Minority, he said.
'You will not attack anyone and walk away while I sit in this committee'  Ayariga to Afenyo-Markin
Ayariga defended his stance, arguing that his conduct was aimed at ensuring adherence to parliamentary procedure and not obstruction.
To describe my conduct here as deliberately obstructing the Minority when Im trying to keep him to the rules is unfair. When you say the conduct of a judge, were not talking about personal conduct who he slept with and who he didnt sleep with. Were talking about his work and how he conducted it, the Majority Leader explained.
He further rebuked the Minority Leader for labeling the committees work as opaque and a travesty of justice.
You are saying that the committee conducted its work in an opaque manner, in darkness and that the outcome of their work is a travesty of justice. Yet, you have not shown that any constitutional rules governing the committees work were breached in any way. How can you describe the work as opaque and improper removal and expect me to sit here and allow that? You are clearly violating the rules, Ayariga asserted.
His comment follows Alexander Afenyo-Markins, criticisms of the committee that recommended the removal of former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo, describing the process as a travesty of justice.
According to him, the decision to remove Justice Torkornoo was carried out in a manner that breached constitutional procedures and undermined the principles of transparency and fairness.
It is our [minority] contention that the removal of Torkornoo didnt adhere to any constitutional procedure. Never should any Ghanaian suffer such a fate. The removal of Torkornoo was cloaked in unacceptably opaque circumstances, Afenyo-Markin said
The controversy led to the Minority Caucus in Parliament rejecting the nomination of Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie and abstained from participating in the vetting proceedings.
The decision to boycott the process was announced by Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin following hours of a back-and-forth with Majority Leader
Mahama Ayariga
, which led to a suspension for nearly 30 minutes.
After recess, Afenyo-Markin announced the abstinence of the Minority Caucus from the process as he led his side to walk out, leaving only members of the Majority side on the Appointments Committee to conduct the vetting process.
""Be it known to you, chairman, and the committee and the country that we, the Minority Caucus, hereby vote en bloc to reject the nominee. We would want to state on record that the Majority can proceed with the questions. We do not intend to proceed with any question. We are, however, registering in the strongest terms that we reject the nomination, and the records should reflect that the report of this committee be a majority report,"" the Minority Leader and MP for Effutu stated.

Why I left the Prisons Service in 1988 - Paul Baffoe-Bonnie explains,"Chief Justice nominee, Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie, has revealed that he left the Ghana Prisons Service in 1988 after being informed that, as a Deputy Superintendent, he was not permitted to marry a junior officer.
He made this known during his vetting by
Parliament
s Appointments Committee on Monday, November 10, 2025.
Afenyo-Markin's 'disputed Chief Justice nominee' comment triggers pushback at vetting
Baffoe-Bonnie explained that, faced with this restriction, he made the difficult decision to leave in order to be with the woman he loved.
I joined the Ghana Prisons Service in 1988 and completed six months of military training. Following my training, I was posted to Sekondi, where I met my wife, who at the time had no rank and was a sixth former.
""I served with the Prisons Service for about two years until 1990, when I was informed that, as a Deputy Superintendent, I was not permitted to marry a junior officer. Since the rules would not allow us to be together, I decided to leave the service, he noted.
Justice Baffoe-Bonnie later transitioned to the judiciary, rising through the ranks to become a highly respected judge with years of experience at the Supreme Court.
He has reaffirmed his integrity and dedication to justice and fairness, highlighting that his 33 years of service in the judiciary reflect his integrity.
The nominee has appeared before
Parliament
s Appointments Committee for vetting ahead of his potential appointment as the next Chief Justice.
During the vetting, lawmakers are expected to examine his professional record, judicial philosophy, and vision for strengthening judicial independence and reforms within the judiciary.

New Patriotic Party
(NPP) in the 2024 General Elections and former Minister for Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has urged party members to prioritise unity and loyalty as the NPP prepares for its Presidential Primaries.

The engagements form part of his efforts to galvanise peace, strengthen cohesion, and reignite confidence among the partys grassroots as preparations intensify for the 2028 General Elections.
He emphasised that the NPPs success depends on maintaining internal harmony and a shared focus on the broader mission of recapturing political power.

Dr Opoku Prempeh also urged the regional leadership to throw their full support behind Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, whom he described as the best candidate to lead the NPP to victory in 2028.
He stressed that Dr Bawumia represents continuity, competence, and the renewed energy needed to restore public confidence in the party.
We cannot afford to let our passion for individual candidates make us lose sight of the greater mission. A strong NPP is one that stands united behind the elephant, regardless of who becomes flagbearer, he added.
Dr Opoku Prempeh concluded by encouraging all members to remain disciplined and focused, noting that unity of purpose would be the NPPs greatest asset heading into 2028.

'Gertrude Torkornoo's removal is a travesty of justice' - Minority Leader,"The Minority Leader in
Parliament
,
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
, has criticised the committee that recommended the removal of former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo, describing the process as a travesty of justice.
He argued that the decision to remove Justice Torkornoo violated constitutional procedures and undermined the principles of transparency and fairness.
Minority moves to stop Paul Baffoe-Bonnie's vetting
It is our contention that the removal of Justice Torkornoo did not adhere to any constitutional procedure. Never should any Ghanaian suffer such a fate. The process was cloaked in unacceptably opaque circumstances, Afenyo-Markin said during the vetting of Chief Justice nominee Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie on Monday, November 10, 2025.
CJ Vetting: 'There are dark clouds in this country over free speech'  Afenyo-Markin
The Minority Leader maintained that the move lacked due process and accountability, warning that such actions set a dangerous precedent for Ghanas democratic governance and judicial independence.
Justice Gertrude Torkornoo, who was appointed Chief Justice in June 2023, became the first head of the judiciary to be removed from office under Ghanas Fourth Republic.
Her removal followed a petition to President
John Dramani Mahama
and a recommendation by a special committee established under Article 146 of the 1992 Constitution.

CJ Vetting: 'I will not allow you to breach an inch of the rules'  Ayariga tells Afenyo-Markin,"The Majority Leader,
Mahama Ayariga
, has dismissed claims that Justice Gabriel Pwamang Committee set up by President John Dramani Mahama to investigate petitions against Justice Gertrude Torkornoo, acted improperly, stressing that all proceedings followed constitutional and parliamentary rules.
He made the remarks on Monday, November 10, 2025, when Chief Justice nominee Paul Baffoe-Bonnie appeared before the Appointments Committee for his vetting.
The work of the proceedings, at no stage have you shown that the rules in the Constitution governing the work of the committee have been breached in any way. How can you come and sit here and describe the work as opaque, a travesty of justice, or an improper removal, and expect me to allow that? You are clearly violating the rules. And when I try to guide you on how to go about your work, then you say that Im trying to obstruct you, Ayariga said.
Paul Baffoe-Bonnie to face vetting despite Minority's attempt to block move
His remarks came after the Minority Leader,
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
, referred to Justice Baffoe-Bonnie as a disputed Chief Justice nominee during his introductory comments at the vetting.
We gather to vet the disputed nominee for the office of Chief Justice. This is a case of whether Ghanas judiciary will remain independent, Afenyo-Markin said.

Justice Torkornoo, appointed Chief Justice in June 2023, was removed from office on Monday, September 1, 2025, by President Mahama, acting on the recommendation of a constitutional committee formed under Article 146 of the 1992 Constitution to probe three petitions accusing her of misconduct in office.
Justice Baffoe-Bonnie, the most senior among the nine remaining justices of the Supreme Court, stepped in to serve as the Acting Chief Justice of Ghana.

How can NPP attract new members if I'm called an 'outsider' and 'slave'?  Bawumia asks,"Ghanas former Vice President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, has expressed disgust at comments that suggest that he is an outsider and a slave in the New Patriotic Party.
These comments were made by the Asante Akim South MP, Kwaku Asante Boateng.
Dr Bawumia, during his campaign tour of the Oti Region on Sunday, found the comments distasteful and wondered how the party is going to attract new members if some leading members hold such a mentality.
He reminded the party of its tradition, values, and principles that have guided it since the formation of the party from the United Party era to a more formidable force in the countrys political arena today.
He questioned, If Dr. Bawumia, after 17 years of service to the party, is described as an outsider and stranger, how do we grow the party to attract new members from all parts of Ghana?
Bawumia urged the party to desist from propounding such bigotry as it threatens unity in the party.
Today, some of my opponents say I am an outsider and a stranger, who does not deserve to lead the party because of where I come from. This is dangerous, divisive, he emphasised.",,Politics, 10 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/How-can-NPP-attract-new-members-if-I-m-called-an-outsider-and-slave-Bawumia-asks-2008805
NPP Primaries: Choose Bawumia's 'rich ideas' over money  Oti delegates urged,"NPP delegates in the Oti Region have been urged to select a competent, marketable leader to guide the party into the 2028 elections.
Welcoming Dr Mahamudu Bawumia to the Oti Region on Friday, November 7, the NPP Regional Chairman, Evans Yaw Dapaah, slammed the flagbearer hopefuls going round bragging about their wealth and warned against such practice.
According to him, the partys January 31st presidential primaries next year should not be about who offers the most money.
Some of the aspirants have been going around bragging that they have money. This contest is not about how wealthy someone is, so please dont fall for their deception, he cautioned.
He urged the party to choose competence over braggarts.
The NDC believed in Mahama and backed him without considering money. I remember during their congress in 2022, Mahama offered the delegates GH 40 transport, but they voted massively for him.
The person we know and believe can bring power to the NPP in 2028 is Dr Mahamadu Bawumia. He is the most marketed person who can bring us victory, so let us all rally behind him and vote massively for him just as the NDC did for Mahama without being influenced by money.

2026 base pay increase lowest in a decade - Comparison shows decline from NPP era,"The recently announced 9 percent increase in the 2026 Base Pay on the Single Spine Salary Structure has sparked discussions among public sector workers and labour analysts, as historical data show it is the lowest salary increment in nearly a decade.
According to the agreement signed on November 9, 2025, between the Government of Ghana and Organised Labour, the new base pay adjustment takes effect from January to December 2026. While the government described the deal as fair and reflective of current economic conditions, a review of salary trends from 2017 to 2024 shows a significant decline in the rate of public sector pay growth compared with previous years.
Data compiled from the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC) indicate that under the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) administration between 2017 and 2024, salary increments for public sector workers were consistently higher.
For instance:
In 2017, salaries rose by 12.5%.
In 2018, by 11%.
In 2019, by 10%.
In 2020, by 15%.
In 2021, workers received 4% plus a 15% interim premium.
In 2022, a 15% Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) was applied to the base salary.
In 2023, public sector workers enjoyed a 30% increment  one of the highest in the NPP era.
And in 2024, increments were 23% for the first half of the year and 25% for the second half.
Government approves 9% salary increase for public sector workers
In contrast, the new 9% increase for 2026 represents a sharp decline, falling below even the lowest adjustments recorded under the NPP administration.
Labour experts note that while the government faces fiscal constraints and seeks to maintain economic stability under the current IMF-supported programme, the modest increase could weaken workers purchasing power amid persistent inflation and cost-of-living pressures.
Some labour leaders have also expressed concern that the 9% adjustment does not adequately reflect the sacrifices of public sector employees or the rising cost of living.
Government representatives, however, have defended the agreement, saying it is part of broader efforts to maintain wage sustainability and protect jobs while continuing engagements with labour on other outstanding conditions of service.
The 2026 Base Pay Agreement, signed by the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), marks the first major wage negotiation under the new administration  but one that already sets a markedly different tone from the more generous salary adjustments of recent years.

'I'm no stranger in NPP' - Dr Bawumia fires back at tribal critics,"Former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has finally broken his silence on remarks by Asante Akim South MP, Kwaku Asante Boateng, who described him as a stranger in the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and therefore unfit to lead the party as its flagbearer.
The comment, which drew widespread criticism from party members and the national secretariat, has been condemned as divisive and unworthy of the NPPs democratic tradition.
Addressing delegates and party faithful during his tour of the Oti Region on Sunday, Dr Bawumia expressed deep disappointment, describing the comment as dangerous and contrary to the NPPs proud tradition of diversity.
He reminded party members that the NPP traces its roots to the United Party (UP), a coalition of ethnic and regional groups from across Ghana, and that this inclusive heritage forms the foundation of the Danquah-Dombo-Busia tradition.
NPP Flagbearer Election: Choose Bawumias rich ideas over money  Oti regional delegates urged
Those who make such comments do not understand the history of our party. The UP was formed from the coming together of people from all walks of life  and that unity gave birth to the NPP, he said.
The NPPs strength lies in its diversity. It does not matter whether you are Dagomba, Ga, Dangme, Sefwi, Ewe, Asante, or Kwahu  if you are capable, you can lead this party, he stressed.
Dr Bawumia lamented that internal rivalry and hatred have driven some senior party members to resort to tribal attacks  a development he warned could undermine the NPPs cohesion and public appeal.
Recounting his long service and sacrifices for the party, he said:
I have served as running mate four times, as Vice President for two terms, and now as flagbearer. I have sacrificed, lost opportunities, and even risked my life for this party. So how can anyone call me a stranger?
He urged delegates to reject divisive rhetoric and embrace unity, tolerance, and respect  values that he said define the NPPs true identity.
What we need is unity and mutual respect in our party and in Ghana. Lets reject divisive talk and focus on building a stronger NPP that represents everyone, he concluded.

From Cash to Conscience: Ken Agyapong's sudden conversion on money politics raises eyebrows,"Controversial flagbearer aspirant of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Kennedy Ohene Agyapong, has taken a surprising moral turn, urging delegates in the Volta Region not to be swayed by cash handouts in the upcoming presidential primaries slated for January 31, 2026.
Speaking on VOV Radio after a meeting with some constituency executives, the outspoken Assin Central MP questioned the motives of some of his opponents, accusing them of using money as a tool to buy loyalty and votes.
When we were begging for five hundred cedis per polling station, where were they? When we didnt have cars as late as May 2016, where were these rich people? People who can give money  where were they? he asked.
Delegates, dont think of todays money; think of your future. Those enticing you with money cant give you anything lasting. After that, theyll say goodbye, and youll still struggle. Vote for the man who loves you, who cares about your welfare, and whos ready to put his life on the line for you, he added.
Kennedy Agyapong
, who claimed to have acquired 60,000 acres of land for the people of the Volta Region, said his commitment to their welfare was proof of his sincerity.
Ken Agyapong campaign names constituency coordinators for grassroots mobilisation
However, political pundits have been left scratching their heads over the MPs sudden gospel against money politics. Many find it ironic that the same
Kennedy Agyapong
 who has never shied away from flaunting his wealth and business success as credentials for leadership  is now decrying the influence of money in politics.
Some observers say this new message may be less about morality and more about strategy  especially if his famous deep pockets are suddenly feeling lighter than usual.

NDC Western Regional Chairman refutes allegations of dealing in sale of railway scraps,"Nana Kojo Toku, Western Regional Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has refuted allegations from public speculations and media discussions surrounding his dealings in railway scraps within the region.
We wish to state categorically that the Regional Chairman of the party, Nana Kojo Toku, has no involvement whatsoever, directly or indirectly, in any transaction, decision, or activity relating to the said railway scraps.
This was contained in a statement issued by Eric Kweku Kyeremah, Special Aide to the Chairman.
The statement said Nana Toku remained fully committed to the partys core values of transparency, accountability, and integrity, and therefore found such allegations or insinuations most unfortunate and misleading.
It said: For the avoidance of doubt, the Regional Chairman has not sanctioned, participated in, or benefited from any operation or engagement connected to the disposal or sale of railway materials.
Any attempt to link his name to this matter is a deliberate act of mischief aimed at tarnishing his hard-earned reputation and diverting attention from the real issues at hand.
The statement thus urged the public, media practitioners, and party faithful to treat such rumours and unverified reports with the contempt they deserve.
The statement added that the Chairman continues to focus on strengthening party unity, supporting government programmes, and ensuring the NDC remains strong and united in the Western Region.",,Politics, 10 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/NDC-Western-Regional-Chairman-refutes-allegations-of-dealing-in-sale-of-railway-scraps-2008758
2024 Election: I thought NPP would win due to our records in education sector  Dr Adutwum,"Former Education Minister Dr
Yaw Osei Adutwum
has reflected candidly on the NPPs election loss, admitting that despite major strides in education, the outcome was a sobering reminder that development achievements alone do not always guarantee political victory.
Speaking on Starr Chat with Bola Ray on Thursday, November 6, 2025, Dr Adutwum said the moment he saw preparations underway at Independence Square for the new presidents swearing-in, the reality of defeat finally sank in. I felt, wow, weve actually lost, he recalled.
He explained that his confidence ahead of the polls had been driven by what he believed were transformative accomplishments in education.
I had some belief that we could win the election based on the work weve done in education, he said.
STEM education that people have talked about for years has now become a reality. We are building model junior high schools, and the country had never seen this before. Public schools like Accra STEM Academy were commissioned  people thought this would never be a reality in Ghana.
However, Dr Adutwum acknowledged that the political dynamics went beyond his sectors performance.
I believed some voters would make an exception and consider what we delivered, but it didnt happen, he admitted. Even in other areas where wed performed well, like road construction, it wasnt enough.
The former ministers reflections, he said, highlight the complex intersection of policy success and electoral politics  a reminder that visible progress in governance does not always translate into votes.",,Politics,  9 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/2024-Election-I-thought-NPP-would-win-due-to-our-records-in-education-sector-Dr-Adutwum-2008689

Minority demands clarity from President Mahama on petition against Justice Baffoe-Bonnie,"The Minority Caucus in
Parliament
has formally written to President
John Dramani Mahama
requesting information on the status of a petition seeking the removal of Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie from office over alleged stated misbehaviour.
In a letter signed by Jerry Ahmed Shaib (Esq.), Second Deputy Minority Whip, the caucus invoked Article 21(1)(f) of the 1992 Constitution and Section 18 of the Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), to demand transparency regarding the handling of the petition.
The petition, filed by Gbandi Nabin Yussif on October 6, 2025, and received at the Jubilee House a day later, calls for the removal of Justice Baffoe-Bonnie in accordance with Article 146(1) of the Constitution.
The Minority is seeking clarification on three key points:
The current status or progress of the petition;
Whether the President has referred the matter to the Council of State, as required by constitutional procedure; and
Any actions or decisions taken by the Council of State in response to the petition.
The caucus stressed that the matter has become even more urgent due to Justice Baffoe-Bonnies nomination for the position of Chief Justice and his upcoming vetting by
Parliament
.
To this end, the Minority is requesting a copy of any investigative report or decision related to the petition, emphasising that such disclosure is essential to uphold transparency and public confidence in the judiciary.
The Minority Caucus respectfully requests that this matter be addressed expeditiously to maintain transparency and accountability within our democratic institutions, the statement said.

No one tells me what to say; I speak based on my own judgement - Abronye tells critics,"Bono Regional Chairman of the NPP, Kwame Baffoe, popularly known as Abronye, has reminded his critics that views he shares on his online platform Ohia TV, are his personal views, which are out of the control or anyone in the NPP.
In the latest episode of his show, Abronye reiterated his independence and his elected position in the NPP as a regional chairman, adding that he does not work for anyone to prevent him from defending himself, or expressing his views on party issues.
Abronye, who clashed with former Health Minister, Richard Anane earlier in the week, was responding to calls for party elders to restrain him.
After former health minister, Richard Anane, alleged that he (Abronye) insulted former President Kufuor at an NPP meeting - a claim which was later clarified as inaccurate by Acting NPP National Chairman, Abronye descended heavily on Richard Anane in a manner that got some roping in former Vice President, Dr Bawumia to ""call Abronye to order"" because of Abronye's support of his flagbearer campaign.
However, responding to the issue on his Ohia TV, Abronye rejected the roping in of Bawumia, or any other person in the NPP, stressing that he is a duly elected regional Chairman of the party, and as such cannot be gagged or controlled
by a presidential candidate whom he does not work for and is also not a member of his campaign team.
""You don't know the difference between a regional chairman and a campaign team member because you're dumb,"" Abronye responded.
""I am a regional chairman duly elected and you must know the difference between a regional chairman and a campaign chairman or campaign team member. I don't work for Bawumia. I'm not his personal assistant. A regional chairman is above that and there is no presidential candidate who will ask a regional chairman to be his personal assistant or a campaign team member. Regional chairmen are above that and no one can stop me.""
On Richard Anane, Abronye served strong notice that he will never stop responding to the former minister if he keeps spreading lies against him.
""Nobody in NPP can ask me to keep quiet if Richard Anane lies against me. If he mentions my name 10 times and lies against me 10 times, I will respond 10 times that he's a liar. He came out and lied against me. If he attacks me 10 times, I will attack him 10 times,"" he said.
On his feud with NPP flagbearer hopeful,
Kennedy Agyapong
, Abronye said he only responds to Kennedy's ""lies and propaganda"" and that he will never stop doing that on his platform.
""Members of the Kennedy campaign who don't have any message were circulating the propaganda against me and thinking that would discourage me from responding to
Kennedy Agyapong
's lies and propaganda.
""If that is your thinking then it is a joke. You people say all sorts of dirty things on Oman FM and Net 2 against Bawumia. But I will  not go that way. What I have vowed to do is to keep exposing the lies and propaganda of
Kennedy Agyapong
against Bawumia. This is why they are not happy with me. I keep exposing their lies and propaganda here and they call it insults. I will continue to expose

Martin Amidu, who himself served as Attorney General and Minister of Justice, in a statement copied to GhanaWeb, said that Dr Ayines action is not only illegal but also points to issues of conflict of interest and bribery.
He said that the current Attorney General should know that the law mandates only the Minister of Finance to approve such a donation to security agencies like EOCO, adding that the actions of Dr Ayine must be investigated.
A Minister of State appointed pursuant to Article 78 of the 1992 Constitution and paid out of public funds pursuant to Article 71 thereof has no business making selective personal donations to any public institution under his supervision on the grounds of lack of conflict of interest because he wants the entity to work efficiently. A personal donation of even one heavy-duty printer by a Member of Parliament who is also a cabinet minister to any public institution will be the equivalent of the ministers monthly emoluments. The donation of six
heavy-duty printers by such a minister to any entity, therefore, calls for urgent criminal investigations.
On Friday, 31 October 2025, the mainstream and online media reported that Dominic Ayine,
the Attorney General, had told the PAC of Parliament that he had bought six heavy-duty
printers from his own money or funds for EOCO. In Ayines words: There is no conflict in
this because I wanted the entity to work efficiently, and that is why I had to make that
donation. But in fact and in law, Ayines conduct has every hallmark of conflict of interest,
bribery and corruption, unconstitutionality, and an incorrigibly blatant weaponisation of law
enforcement for purely political objectives, he said.
Martin Amidu added, Dominic Ayine knows that any donation to EOCO by anybody, including himself in his private capacity, which does not satisfy Section 15(b) of Act 804 in the sense of having been approved by the Minister responsible for Finance, is an unlawful donation tainted with illegality.
Watch what Dr Ayine said:
Dr Ayine, in response to concerns raised by members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) regarding whether EOCO had received any grants or donations from unapproved sources,
disclosed that he personally financed the purchase of six printers for the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO).
He clarified that EOCO does not receive financial support or grants from private individuals, emphasising that his contribution was a personal gesture aimed at supporting the institutions work and does not constitute a conflict of interest.
If you look at the listed entities, for instance, the Bank of Ghana, its government; its part of the apparatus of the state. EOCO does not receive such donations from private persons because of issues of conflict of interest. For example, when I assumed office in February, one of the things they briefed me on was that they did not have printers.
We looked everywhere; we couldnt find the funds to buy the printers. I purchased six heavy-duty printers for them out of my own funds. There is no conflict in this because I wanted the entity to work efficiently, which is why I made that contribution, he noted.

"'His time's not up is empty noise, Bryan's vision and victory our true focus'  Eric Twum","Eric Amoako Twum, the campaign spokesperson for Dr
Bryan Acheampong
, has vehemently dismissed the opposition's 'His time is not up' campaign against Dr
Bryan Acheampong
as baseless, labelling it as a desperate attempt to derail a candidate whose message of progress and development is resonating deeply with the electorate.
Speaking with unwavering conviction, Eric Twum asserted that Dr Acheampong's victory is not merely anticipated but assured, driven by the compelling and positive agenda he offers.
""We find the 'His time is not up' slogan to be nothing more than a hollow echo from desperate corners. It's a campaign devoid of substance, lacking any meaningful critique of Dr
Bryan Acheampong
's track record or his forward-looking vision.
""Such narratives betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the discerning Ghanaian voter, who is keenly aware of who genuinely champions their aspirations and who simply resorts to tired, uninspired rhetoric,"" Eric Amoako Twum stated.
Mr Twum elaborated that the opposition's strategy reveals a profound lack of alternative solutions or a coherent message that could genuinely challenge Dr
Bryan Acheampong
's momentum. ""When your opponents have nothing concrete to offer, they resort to creating noise. But the electorate is not swayed by such flimsy propaganda.
They are looking for leadership, tangible plans, and a vision that promises a better tomorrow, and that is precisely what Dr
Bryan Acheampong
consistently delivers.""
The spokesperson articulated the core strength of Dr
Bryan Acheampong
's campaign, underscoring that it is built on a foundation of solid proposals and a clear understanding of the needs of the constituents.
According to him, Dr Acheampong's message is one of hope, progress, and inclusive development, adding that it speaks to improving livelihoods, fostering economic growth, and building resilient communities.
""This isn't about personality; it's about policies, performance, and a genuine commitment to public service.""
With an air of undeniable certainty, Eric Amoako Twum concluded by reiterating his absolute conviction in Dr
Bryan Acheampong
's electoral success.
""The ground is well of support for Dr Acheampong because his message is real, it's impactful, and it offers a pathway to a brighter future. We are not just confident; we are convinced that the people will decisively reject these empty campaigns and overwhelmingly endorse Dr
Bryan Acheampong

Cyber Defence System invoice missing from our records  Witness in Adu-Boahene case tells court,"The Director of Finance at the National Signals Bureau (NSB), Edith Ruby Opokua Adumuah, has informed the Accra High Court that the payment invoice for the purchase of a Cyber Defence System, which is at the heart of the prosecution of Kwabena Adu-Boahene, the former Director-General of the NSB, was not found in the bureaus records.
The update was shared on GHOne TVs X page on Friday, November 7, 2025, with the post stating, ""Payment invoice for purchase of Cyber Defence System not in NSB records, Edith Adumuah (Director of Finance, National Signals Bureau) tells court.""
Kwabena Adu-Boahene: Here is what you need to know about the former Director-General of NSB
Adumuah made this disclosure during the conclusion of her evidence-in-chief as the second prosecution witness, under the guidance of Deputy Attorney General Dr Justice Srem-Sai.
The defence team, led by Samuel Atta Akyea, has been invited to cross-examine her to test the credibility of her testimony before the court, presided over by Justice John Eugene Nyante Nyadu.
Appeal Court says 'no' to Adu-Boahene over request to overturn High Court ruling
Adu-Boahene, Adjei-Boateng, and their company have been slapped with 11 charges for allegedly transferring GH49 million (approximately $7 million) from the bureaus account to their personal account.
Addressing the press on Monday, March 24, 2025, Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine, stated that Adu-Boahene was implicated in the unauthorised transfer of $7 million, originally allocated for cybersecurity infrastructure, into his private accounts.
In his capacity as Director of the National Signals Bureau, Mr Adu-Boahene, on January 30, 2020, signed a contract on behalf of the Government of Ghana and the National Security on the one hand, and on the other hand, an Israeli company named RLC Holdings Limited. The contract was for the purchase of a cyber defence system software at a price of $7 million, the Attorney General said.
Providing further details, Dr Ayine disclosed that just days after signing the agreement, Adu-Boahene initiated a suspicious transaction.
On February 6, 2020, he then transferred an initial amount of GH27,100,000 from the National Signals Bureau account at Fidelity Bank to a private BNC account at UMB. Official documentation on the transfer reveals that the amount was for the payment of cyber defence system software. He transferred the money to his private company, he told the media.
According to Dr Ayine, investigations further uncovered that the former NSB boss allegedly channelled the funds not only into his personal account, but also into accounts belonging to his wife.

I cannot keep quiet to an inconclusive report  NDC MP replies interior minister,"The Member of Parliament for Awutu Senya East, Phyllis Naa Koryoo Okunor, has responded to the Interior Minister Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak over what she described as an inconclusive report on the deadly election violence in her constituency.
Addressing the media on November 6, 2025, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) legislator insisted she never denied being attacked, contradicting the ministers briefing to the nation two days earlier.
I have remained quiet despite calls by well-meaning Ghanaians including my constituents who witnessed these brutal attacks. At no time did I say no attack happened. I stated emphatically to the task force that on election day during my rounds, I noticed my convoy was being followed by a V8 vehicle allegedly known to be used by Hawa Koomson and a NADMO pickup which had a green government number plate.
After visiting some polling stations, I decided to go home because I felt my life was in danger. So, I am convinced that at the conclusion of this investigation the truer facts will emerge. On the issue of unwillingness of persons who witnessed these acts to testify, this is entirely out of my control, she said.
She continued, There are videos to some of these attacks and these are available for the committee to aid their work. Friends of the media, does the unwillingness to eyewitness and victims to testify mean these documented acts of killings didn't happen? Even if there is records of loss of life and injuries.""
During the briefing, the minister disclosed that the Member of Parliament for Awutu Senya East, Phyllis Naa Koryoo Okunor, had denied any knowledge of the violence that marred her election, an incident that left one person dead.
Honourable Phyllis Naa Koryoo Okunor denied that her convoy was attacked. She was nowhere near the scene of the incident.
Persons involved in the incident have avoided speaking with the Task Force, while Mohammed Ali and others who were in the Mahindra pickup truck and fired shots from their vehicle have also refused to cooperate. Their accounts have, therefore, not been established. Mohammed Ali is said to have been flown abroad for further treatment.
Confusion as interior minister contradicts Awutu Senya East MPs claim on election violence
The late Yusif Larri Idriss died from a gunshot wound and those who were in the Mahindra pickup with him know what happened. The driver of the Mahindra has been traced and further investigations are ongoing. The Task Force will continue its investigations, he stated.
However, Phyllis Naa Koryoo Okunor has refuted the ministers assertion as inconclusive report.
She denied ever saying that she was not attacked by the alleged thugs.
""I would have waited for the investigations to conclude before speaking. But I cannot keep quiet over an inconclusive report as clearly stated by our honourable Minister for Interior during his press briefing.
And officially I have not given my written statement to the police yet due to the ill-treatment during the 2020 election violence.""
The NDC MP added, ""Therefore, statements on the media are inaccurate and not mine. Let me end by saying that as the citizen member of the good people of Awutu Senya East Constituency, I consider myself a mother for all.
I have therefore encouraged reconciliation and unity amongst all the rank and file of the party. And I would encourage the tax force to stick to exactly what I told them for fairness and prosperity.

Tensions flare at NPP headquarters as vice chairman reportedly assaults party communicator,"Tension erupted at the headquarters of the opposition
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) in Accra on November 6, 2025, during the party's press conference, when the partys National Vice Chairman, Alhaji Osman Masawudu, allegedly slapped a party communicator, popularly known as Okyeman, during a heated exchange in the presence of several national executives.
According to eyewitnesses, the altercation occurred during an internal meeting at the partys headquarters.
The confrontation reportedly began as a verbal disagreement over communication strategy and party messaging but quickly escalated into a physical altercation, shocking those in attendance.
Sources within the party say attempts by other executives to calm the situation were initially unsuccessful, though order was eventually restored.
While details of what triggered the incident remain unclear, some insiders described the clash as regrettable and avoidable, calling for unity and professionalism among party officials ahead of the 2028 general elections.
The incident has sparked widespread discussion among party members and on social media, with many calling for the partys leadership to address the matter promptly to preserve internal cohesion and discipline.
As of press time, the NPP leadership had not issued an official statement regarding the alleged assault or any potential disciplinary action.
Observers say the development underscores growing tensions within the party as it navigates post-election restructuring and prepares its communication machinery for upcoming political engagements.",,Politics,  7 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Tensions-flare-at-NPP-headquarters-as-vice-chairman-reportedly-assaults-party-communicator-2008436
RTI filed over Bryan Acheampong's controversial US army service claims,"A Ghanaian citizen has filed a Right to Information (RTI) request with Parliament seeking clarification on whether Dr Bryan Acheampong, former Minister of Food and Agriculture, submitted official documents to support his claimed service in the United States military.
The request, received by Parliament on Tuesday, November 4, 2025, specifically asks whether Dr Acheampong provided the Appointments Committee with a copy of his honourable discharge certificate or any official record showing his rank of enlistment and discharge from the US Army or Air Force as he pledged during his vetting in 2023.
During that vetting session, Members of Parliament Dr Cassiel Ato Forson and Kwame Agbodza questioned the Abetifi MP about the rank at which he enlisted and exited the US Air Force, as indicated on his curriculum vitae.
Dr Acheampong declined to disclose the details publicly, citing national security, but assured the committee that he would submit the full documentation immediately after the sitting.
When you leave the military, you will either be given an honourable or dishonourable discharge. Immediately after this sitting, I will produce my honourable discharge certificate which will detail everything I did in the military, Dr Acheampong told the committee at the time.
The RTI application, filed under Sections 1, 18, and 23 of the Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), was addressed to the Clerk to Parliament, who serves as the institutions Information Officer.
Under the law, Parliament has 14 days until November 18, 2025 to respond.
Should Parliament confirm receipt of such documents, the applicant has requested certified copies or sufficient details of the records submitted by Dr. Acheampong.

Acting NPP Chairman breaks silence on alleged disrespect toward Kufuor by Abronye,"The Acting National Chairman of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Danquah Smith Butey, has dismissed reports suggesting that Kwame Baffoe Abronye (Abronye DC) disrespected former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
during a recent party meeting.
Speaking on Adom FMs Dwaso Nsem, Butey described the reports as misleading, explaining that the supposed incident stemmed from a misunderstanding during an internal party discussion.
It wasnt that Abronye disrespected President Kufuor. The misunderstanding arose from a meeting where the former President made some proposals. Its an in-house matter that should never have been made public, he clarified.
He criticised Dr Richard Anane for publicising the issue, noting that such matters should be resolved within the partys internal structures rather than in the media.
He added that Dr Anane was not present at the meeting and might have been misinformed.
Abronye descends on Dr Richard Anane over remarks about disrespecting JA Kufuor
Recounting what transpired, Butey said former President Kufuor offered advice, and members were allowed to respond. When discussions began to drift off-topic, he intervened to restore order.
Butey acknowledged that while Abronyes tone during the meeting could be considered a misstep, it did not amount to an insult.
Abronye did not insult President Kufuor. He constantly referred to him as his in-law during the discussion. If he had insulted him, I would never have tolerated it, he stressed.
He urged party members to avoid spreading misinformation that could damage the image of respected party figures and emphasised the importance of protecting the NPPs legacy.

Court to rule on OSP's request for undercover witness to testify in-camera in Bissue case,"The High Court in Accra has fixed November 19 to make a determination as to whether or not an investigative Journalist said to be working with TigerEye PI be made to testify privately (in-camera) in the case involving Charles Bissue and two others.
This follows an application moved formally by Prosecutors of the Office of the Special Prosecutor urging the Court in Accra to protect the safety and welfare potential witness Benjamin Agyapong.
The request has been fiercely opposed by lawyers of Charles Cromwell Nanabanyin Onuawonto Bissue, former Secretary to the now-defunct Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) and the other two accused.
Bissue, the first accused together with Raphael Mensah, former Systems Manager of the GalamStop software, second scuse) and Dr Naa Dedei Tagoe, former Project Coordinator of the IMCIM  third scuse have variously pleaded not guilty to eight counts relating to corruption and corruption-related offences.
In Court on Wednesday, October 5, 2025, before Justice Audrey Kocuvie-Tay, Maame Akua Adiyiah, the lead prosecutor in the case for the OSP while moving the motion for the potential witness to testify in-camera, said the witness has genuine fear for his safety.
She referenced the past events where Ahmed Suale was murdered fews days after his pictures were published to the public, to buttress the point that, the potential witness being a colleague of the deceased harboured.
The OSP prosecutors argued that the court has the authority to grant protection to the witness, allowing him to testify with his face only shown to the parties involved.
They emphasized that the witnesss safety is paramount and that the court should not wait until something happens before taking action
The OSP is not asking for the witness to be put into a witness protection program but rather for the court to exercise its authority to protect the witnesss identity during testimony.
The issue of corruption is so wide in Ghana, the prosecutors stated, citing a UN report that many people pay bribes but only a few report it.
The OSP is not asking for the witness to be put into a witness protection program but rather for the court to exercise its authority to protect the witnesss identity during testimony.
They cited a recent Court of Appeal case, Republic vs. Kwasi Nyantakyi, to support their argument that the court should be proactive in protecting witnesses. The OSP believes that refusing this application may deter the witness from testifying, which would not be in the interest of justice.
Opposition
Defence lawyers  Augustines Obuor, Charles Okyere and Opoku Agyei representing the first, second and third accused persons respectively took turns to oppose vehemently against the Request before the High Court presided over by Justice Audrey Kocuvi-Tay.
They argued that the prosecutions application for the witness to testify in-camera, citing procedural issues with the affidavit.
They also argued that the witnesss employer, TigerEyePI, is not a registered entity, and theres no evidence to support the witnesss claim of fear.
The defense argued that the prosecutions application is inadequate and doesnt meet constitutional and court act criteria.
They questioned the witnesss status as an undercover investigator, noting that his employment details dont mention this.
Powerful in what? The defense also pointed out that the witnesss statement was made six years ago, and theres been no report of harm despite numerous interactions with authorities.
The defense argued that the prosecution hasnt shown that testifying in-camera is necessary for public morality, safety, or order.
They cited constitutional provisions, including Article 126(3) and Article 19(14) and (15), which allow for exceptions to public trials.
The defense emphasized that the prosecution hasnt demonstrated how public testimony would prejudice the public interest.

He noted that the Hope Tour represents more than just campaign visits, describing it as a platform to listen, learn, and share ideas with the NPPs grassroots.
Transformation begins with dialogue, and true leadership is forged by connecting with those who tirelessly uphold the foundation of our great party, Dr Adutwum added.
Highlighting the significance of the Ahafo Region, Dr Adutwum said it embodies the energy and optimism that drive the NPPs development vision.

NAIMOS Attack: NDC organiser descends heavily on Asutifi North MP,"The Greater Accra Regional Organiser of the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC), Anthony Nukpenu, has descended on the partys Member of Parliament for Asutifi North, Ebenezer Kwaku Addo, over the attack on a team from the National Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) at Ahafo Hwidiem in the Ahafo Region.
Speaking in an interview on Adom TV on November 4, 2025, Anthony Nukpenu described the MP as an idiot who does not deserve a seat in Parliament if he truly interfered with the work of the NAIMOS team.
He added that the MPs alleged actions, if proven true, would amount to a contravention of the orders of the President,
John Dramani Mahama
.
If really that Member of Parliament was at the post, then he is an idiot. He does not deserve a seat in Parliament; he doesnt.
""As a Member of Parliament, you know the actions of your president, and the presidents power is operating in an area  you go there not to help them, but you aid your youth to overcome them; you have overcome the state. It is only an idiot who can do that. He deserves no seat in Parliament, Nukpenu fumed.
He further added that, And if that Speaker does not take action from today, I dont know the country we are building.
The NDC organiser urged the Speaker of Parliament to suspend the MP and call for a probe to determine whether he is complicit in the allegations levelled against him.
I was acting on the instructions of Collins Dauda - Asutifi North MP alleges
About the attack:
According to a report by journalist and activist Erastus Asare Donkor, ten military officers who are members of the National Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS), led by their Director of Operations, conducted an operation in the Ahafo Region on Saturday, November 1, 2025.
During the operation, the NAIMOS Director reportedly received information that an excavator was being used for illegal mining along the roadside near Branikrom. The team moved to the area and arrested several illegal miners, including a Burkinabe national.
Erastus Asare Donkor further stated that the NAIMOS team requested the presence of the site owner at the location where the mining activities were taking place.
He added that an individual later arrived, identifying himself as a Defence Intelligence (DI) representative from the Ahafo Region, followed by another person who reportedly claimed to be the site owner.
A search conducted by the NAIMOS team at the site led to the discovery of various types of ammunition, as well as cash and mobile phones.
The Ghana Police Service has since invited the Asutifi North MP for questioning over the incident. He has, however, denied allegations that he incited a mob or obstructed the NAIMOS team to secure the release of persons arrested by the military officers.

ORAL: NPP panicking over President Mahama's asset recovery drive - Kwakye Ofosu,"The Minister of State in charge of Government Communications,
Felix Kwakye Ofosu
, has accused the opposition
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) of being uncomfortable with the governments ongoing efforts to expose and recover assets linked to corruption during their administration.
According to a report by adomfmonline.com, he made the remarks in an interview on Joy FMs Top Story on Thursday, November 6, 2025.
Kwakye Ofosu said the NPPs recent outbursts show that they fear accountability under the Operation Recover All Loot (ORAL) initiative being implemented by the government.
They are not happy that their misdeeds, corruption, and corrupt practices while in government are coming to light. They are unhappy that the Government of Ghana is implementing the Operation Recover All Loot, which is a policy we canvassed before the people of Ghana. Through that, we will be able to hold them to account.
They think that by holding them to account, they will be exposed for the people of Ghana to see that they were not trustworthy and that they abused the mandate and resources that were given to them. That is the only reason why they are saying the things they are saying, he noted.
The minister maintained that the governments actions are rooted in transparency and justice, not political retribution.

It is difficult to understand how anyone can oppose a process that involves holding public officials to account, he stressed.
His comments follow accusations by the NPP that the Mahama administrations ongoing anti-corruption drive is a state-sponsored witch hunt targeting former government officials.
Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, November 5, 2025, the General Secretary of the NPP, Justin Frimpong Kodua, said the party has consistently drawn the governments attention to what it describes as the growing politicisation of law enforcement and judicial processes.
He noted that the party has organised several demonstrations and media briefings to remind the president and his administration that Ghana remains a nation governed by the rule of law, not political influence.
ORAL must succeed or Ghana's democracy will collapse  Divine Nkrumah
We have urged the NDC government to end the continuous weaponisation of state security and the judiciary against political opponents, but unfortunately, our calls have fallen on deaf ears, Jutin Kodua stated.
The ORAL Committee was established on December 18, 2024, under President
John Dramani Mahama
s administration.
It was tasked with identifying and retrieving looted state assets and has since submitted its final report to President Mahama.

14 out of 17 Ken electoral area coordinators in Shama declare support for Bawumia,"Former Vice President, Dr Mahamaudu Bawumia ended his Western Regional campaign tour on Wednesday with a major boost, following the declaration of support for him by 14 out of 17 electoral area coordinators of the Shama Constituency.
All 14 electoral area coordinators campaigned for Kennedy Agyapong in the 2023 NPP primaries, leading to Ken winning the Shama Constituency, but they say they have now ""learnt their lessons"" after the 2024 elections .
'I entered politics to serve the people, not to enrich myself' - Dr Bawumia
Speaking to fellow NPP delegates of the Shama Constituency during Dr Bawumias campaign tour, the 14 coordinators, noted that after they were deceived to campaign against Dr Bawumia in 2023, those who deceived them betrayed the collective interest of the NPP and campaigned for the NDC, against the NPP.
""Our father is Nana Kwamena. He is the Chief Coordinator for the Bawumia Campaign here. In 2023, we did not understand him and together with all my colleagues here, we did not support Dr Bawumia and he lost here in Shama,"" said one of the coordinators.
""But in the  2024 elections, we learnt our lessons. We realised that those who deceived us and got us to campaign against Doctor, later turned around and were rather campaigning for the NDC.""
""So for us electoral coordinators, we have learnt our lessons and together with our colleagues the delegates, we won't make the mistake we made. This time, we want to be part of his victory and we are resolved to voting for him.""

Abronye descends on Dr Richard Anane over remarks about disrespecting JA Kufuor,"The Bono Regional Chairman of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Kwame Baffoe Abronye, popularly known as Abronye DC, has descended heavily on Dr Richard Anane, a leading member of the party, over comments the latter made about him.
Dr Anane, a former Member of Parliament (MP) for Nhyiaeso and Minister of Health, had accused Abronye in a recent interview of disrespecting former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
during a meeting involving NPP executives.
According to Dr Anane, Abronye allegedly challenged or disrespected a submission made by former President Kufuor at the said meeting, prompting the NPP executives present to intervene and apologize to the statesman.
Dr Anane also questioned Abronyes longevity and contributions to the party, suggesting that he lacked the impetus to make such unwarranted attacks on senior members and party elders.
In response to Dr Ananes comments, Abronye launched a rebuttal, accusing the former Health Minister of corruption and incompetence during his time in public office.
According to Abronye, Dr Anane is not part of the NPPs National Council because he lacks the requisite knowledge and credibility to serve at that level.
Dr Richard Anane is not a member of the Executive Council or the National Council because those are places where only knowledgeable people meet and he doesnt qualify to be there, Abronye stated.
He further accused Dr Anane of corruption during his days as a medical doctor and alleged that the former minister stole from the state during his tenure in government.
Apart from becoming a minister and making more money than I have, he doesnt have anything I dont have. He hasnt gone to school more than me, the only thing he did was to steal from the state when he was a minister, Abronye alleged.
He added that Dr Ananes claim of having served longer in the NPP should be a matter for debate between the two of them.
So, for his claim that he has been in the party longer than I have that should be debated between the two of us, Abronye said.
@thekennedydoctrine
Abronye insults Hon. Richard Anane because Mr. Anane granted an interview in which he said that Abronye disrespected President Kufuor during a National Council meeting.
