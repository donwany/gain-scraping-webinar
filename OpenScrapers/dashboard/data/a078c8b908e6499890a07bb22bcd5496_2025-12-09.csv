Ghana is a talk show country  Bokpin,"Economist Professor Godfred Bokpin has delivered a sharp critique of public discourse that is not grounded in data.He argues that national conversations are too often driven by emotion rather than evidence, underscoring the need to prioritize data in terms of its use, accessibility and relevance to policy making.He stressed that putting data at the centre of discussions is essential for sound economic decision-making.Professor Godfred Bokpin made these remarks during a panel discussion at the 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users and Enhancers.“As an academic, I put more emphasis on data than gold because I can do without gold. Countries have managed the affairs without gold deposits. I will choose data over gold. I will choose data over oil. I will choose data over every input because without data, nothing gets done. That is how important data is,” he said.He added that the Ghana Statistical Service generates a significant amount of data that remains underutilized, calling for stronger efforts to harness it for economic planning and business decision-making.“There is so much data that is harvested in this country by the Ghana Statistical Service. Sometimes we think that Ghana Statistical Service exists only to give a GDP number. They do so much, so much. But the question is, in our daily life, how often do we rely on data? How data-driven are we? This country is a talk show country. Forgive me.”“The reason this country is a talk show country is that a lot of our discussions across the media platform is not driven by data. If we were driven by data as a country, there would be less disagreement in our discussions on media platforms, and there would be less emotion, and probably less fight. You understand that? Because the data is what it is,” Professor Bokpin remarked.He said once data is placed at the centre of national dialogue, arguments can be made dispassionately, irrespective of where one falls on the political divide, creating a healthier environment for policy making and economic reforms.“If we are doing well, the data says so, it doesn’t matter which party you belong to. So inflation has come down to 6.3%. You don’t need a prophet to tell you this is it and the implication because this is what it is. So sometimes our dogmatism and all of that is magnified because we are less driven by data. Sometimes you see people making arguments driven by emotions. The reason that is happening is because they have not looked at the data. What is the data saying? I think that we are at a point where we can elevate data in terms of its usage, accessibility, and we need to put data at the forefront of national discussion. This way, Ghana will be able to make meaningful progress,” Professor Bokpin mentioned.Tags: BokpinDataGhana News",Daniel Sackitey,,"December 9, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/ghana-is-a-talk-show-country-bokpin/
Nana Akomea: I didnt sell a single foot of STC land,"Former Managing Director of the State Transport Company (STC), Nana Akomea, has dismissed allegations that he sold lands belonging to the company during his tenure.He insisted that attempts to link him to the disposal of STC assets were politically motivated and unfounded.Speaking on Point Blank on Eyewitness News on Monday, December 8, 2025, Mr. Akomea described the claims as false and misleading, emphasising that no STC property was sold under his leadership.“I haven’t sold even a single foot of STC land. So I don’t understand why somebody would make such claims,” he said.Mr. Akomea argued that it was rather the National Democratic Congress (NDC) administration that sold portions of STC land in the past.He alleged that around 2010, when STC was experiencing financial challenges, the then government approved the sale of about four acres of the company’s land in Takoradi to retail giant Melcom.“The people who actually sold STC land were NDC when they were in government. They sold about 4 acres of the STC land when the company was in difficulty. They resorted to selling the land in Tarkoradi, around 2010, to a company called Melcom.“They sold the MD’s bungalow at Ridge, so when I was serving as the MD, I had to look for my own place to stay. They sold 4 acres at the headquarters itself to a company called BCL,” he added.Bawumia will outperform his 2023 NPP primaries showing – Nana AkomeaBawumia will outperform his 2023 NPP primaries showing – Nana AkomeaTags: Ghana NewsNana AkomeaNDCNPPSTC",William Narh,,"December 9, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/nana-akomea-i-didnt-sell-a-single-foot-of-stc-land/
OSP will disappear without Constitutional reform  Prof. Prempeh warns,"Prof. Henry Kwasi Prempeh, Executive Director of the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), has called for a constitutional solution to address the ongoing controversies surrounding the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP).Speaking on Channel One TV’s The Point of View with Bernard Avle on Monday, December 8, Prof. Prempeh said the challenges confronting the OSP cannot be resolved through piecemeal reforms or prolonged litigation. He warned that without a decisive constitutional remedy, the office risks becoming ineffective or eventually disappearing.He argued that the situation demands a fundamental constitutional rethink, rather than attempts to “renovate around the problem.”“The problem we’re facing now calls for a constitutional solution. Basically, that is how we can resolve this impasse. If we don’t, we start litigating around it, and the Office will disappear at some point if we don’t solve the problem.“If we’re serious about solving the problem, there’s no shortage of innovative ideas to deal with it. There are comparative models around; we can innovate our own,” he suggested.His comments come amid growing calls by the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, and some Members of Parliament for the abolition of the OSP, with responsibilities for investigating and prosecuting corruption-related offences being transferred to the Attorney-General’s Department.Addressing Parliament on Wednesday, December 3, Mr. Ayariga questioned the rationale behind what he described as the under-resourcing of the Attorney-General’s Department while significant funds are allocated to the OSP, which he argued has failed to meet public expectations.The debate over the future of the OSP continues as key stakeholders consider various options to strengthen Ghana’s anti-corruption architecture.Ace Ankomah: OSP must merge with DPP and EOCO to ensure independenceTags: Ace AnkomahCDD GhanaGhana NewsheadlineKissi AgyebengPoint of ViewProf. Henry Kwasi PrempehSpecial prosecutor",Leticia Osei,,"December 9, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/osp-will-disappear-without-constitutional-reform-prof-prempeh-warns/
Ace Ankomah: OSP must merge with DPP and EOCO to ensure independence,"Private legal practitioner Ace Anan Ankomah has outlined a series of proposals aimed at strengthening the effectiveness and independence of Ghana’s Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), amid renewed debate over whether the institution should be scrapped or maintained.Speaking on Channel One TV’s The Point of View on Monday, December 8, Mr. Ankomah responded to calls from sections of the public and Parliament regarding the future of the OSP. He proposed a constitutional review of Article 88(3) and (4), which define the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General.He argued that the Attorney-General’s Department, which previously handled corruption and economic crimes, has historically struggled to deliver justice in complex cases.“In my view, Parliament passing the OSP Act is the biggest concession that, when it comes to corruption and corruption-related offences, the AG’s office has not done well,” Ankomah said.He pointed to challenges such as the intricate nature of economic crimes and the strength of legal defenses mounted by accused persons.Ankomah proposed combining the energy and focus that inspired the creation of the OSP with the stabilizing structure of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), the unit under the AG’s office responsible for criminal prosecutions.He stressed the need for a criminal prosecution authority that operates independently of political control.“We cannot trust any government with criminal prosecutions because we see that it favours their friends,” he stated.He cited instances of incoming administrations filing nolle prosequi to discontinue ongoing cases, a practice he said undermines public confidence in the justice system.Ankomah’s proposal calls for the entire criminal prosecution wing of the AG’s office to be separated and merged with the OSP and the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) to form an independent National Prosecutions Authority.He said the authority should be headed by a civil servant and enjoy judicial-quality independence, including security of tenure, financial autonomy, and insulation from political interference.“Yes, the police will still investigate crime, but this office will be the authority to prosecute so that we can be sure there is minimal political interference,” Ankomah added.Ace Ankomah: Parliament has great aversion to independent institutionsTags: Ace AnkomahAGEOCOGhanaGhana NewsOSPPoliceProsecutors",Abigail Arthur,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/ace-ankomah-osp-must-merge-with-dpp-and-eoco-to-ensure-independence/
Ace Ankomah: Parliament has great aversion to independent institutions,"Private legal practitioner Ace Ankomah has suggested that Ghana’s Parliament has historically shown resistance to independent state institutions once they begin to assert their constitutional autonomy.His comments come against the backdrop of calls by the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, and some Members of Parliament for the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) to be abolished, with proposals that the Attorney-General’s Department should instead handle all corruption-related investigations and prosecutions.Addressing Parliament on Wednesday, December 3, Mr Ayariga questioned why the Attorney-General’s Department remains under-resourced while significant funds are allocated to the OSP, which he argued has failed to meet public expectations.Mr Ankomah, however, offered a broader perspective on the debate while speaking on Channel One TV’s The Point of View with Bernard Avle on Monday, December 8.He argued that Parliament’s posture toward the OSP reflects a long-standing pattern of hostility toward independent constitutional bodies.“Parliament has a great aversion to all the independent institutions, even those set up by the Constitution,” he said, citing the experience of the Auditor-General’s Office as an example.According to Mr Ankomah, it took legal action to compel the Auditor-General to exercise its constitutional powers of disallowance and surcharge years after the Constitution came into effect.He said that once the office began actively enforcing those powers, it recovered about GH¢65 million for the state, based on World Bank data.He further recalled subsequent events that, in his view, weakened the Auditor-General’s Office, including parliamentary debates aimed at circumventing Supreme Court decisions that strengthened the institution’s independence.“For years after the constitution came into effect, the Auditor General had never bothered to assert the independence of disallowance and surcharge. It took us to go to court to get a court order to compel the Auditor General to start disallowing and surcharging.“At least according to the World Bank, by the time we killed the Auditor General’s office again by declaring the occupant Togolese and declaring him retired all of a sudden, the former Auditor General [Daniel Domelevo] had recovered GHC65 million for the Republic of Ghana.He added, “This is according to the World Bank. Okay, then we decided that he was doing too much work. But the interesting thing was that in Parliament, there was a debate, I think the vetting of a Minister of National Security, where between the minority and majority, they decided that the decision we went to the Supreme Court for, Occupy Ghana, was too bad. They should find a way to go around it. I remember we issued a statement challenging that, and they immediately backed down. So whenever the institution starts showing any independence, our Parliament tends to get anti.”Mr Ankomah argued that similar reactions now confront the OSP as it seeks to establish itself, cautioning against rushing to dismantle institutions that are still developing.He called on Ghanaians to urge Parliament to exercise restraint and allow independent offices the space to grow, stressing that institutional learning and effectiveness take time.Mahama to receive Bawku Mediation Report December 11Tags: Ace AnkomahGhana Newsindependent institutionsKissi AgyebengMahama AyarigaOSPParliamentPrivate Legal Practitioner",Leticia Osei,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/ace-ankomah-parliament-has-great-aversion-to-independent-institutions/

"Case against former PPA boss adjourned to January 20, 2026","The trial of former Chief Executive of the Public Procurement Authority (PPA), Adjenim Boateng Adjei, has been adjourned to January 20, 2026.The case resumed on Monday, December 8, 2025, with the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) seeking the court’s permission to call an additional witness.The motion, which remains pending, prompted the adjournment.Mr. Adjei is standing trial on eight charges, including using public office for profit and influencing the procurement process to secure an unfair advantage.The case, titled The Republic v. Adjenim Boateng Adjei (CR/0257/2024), is being prosecuted by the OSP.The charges stem from allegations that the former PPA boss abused his office between March 2017 and August 2019 by manipulating the award of public contracts for personal gain.In 2024, similar charges were filed against him in relation to Talent Discovery Limited (TDL), a company allegedly used to obtain government contracts.The controversy first gained national attention in 2019 following the investigative documentary “Contracts for Sale,” which led to Mr. Adjei’s dismissal by then-President Nana Akufo-Addo upon the recommendations of the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ).The OSP noted that the current Special Prosecutor inherited the case and has since undertaken a review requiring a re-direction of the prosecution strategy.According to the office, the ongoing efforts are aimed at ensuring the matter is conducted in the best interest of the state.The case will continue on January 20, 2026.Trial of former PPA Boss Adjenim Boateng Adjei resumes todayTags: CHRAJGhana NewsNana Addo Dankwa Akufo-AddoOSPPPA",William Narh,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/case-against-former-ppa-boss-adjourned-to-january-20-2026/
Rising Breast Cancer cases strain Korle Bu  Surgeon demands more centres,"A General Surgeon at the Breast Cancer Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Dr. Josephine Nsaful, is calling for the establishment of more cancer centres across the country to help manage the rising number of breast cancer cases. She says the current unit at Korle Bu is overwhelmed by the growing patient load.Speaking to the media at the launch of the Dzidula Breast Cancer Foundation in Accra on Sunday, December 8, 2025, Dr. Nsaful revealed that the Breast Cancer Unit receives a minimum of 600 new cases annually.“We see approximately 600 new cases of breast cancer every year, in addition to those already living with the disease. It is quite concerning and alarming. We are overwhelmed by the large number of patients we have to attend to.“We have one of the longest clinic days in the surgical department. It will help if we have more cancer centres across the country so that some burden is lifted from teaching hospitals and, more importantly, cancer care becomes accessible to Ghanaians,” she said.Breast cancer survivor and founder of the Dzidula Breast Cancer Foundation, Fafa Gozo, stressed the need for private sector support to ensure breast cancer patients receive uninterrupted and quality care.“I have people in that room who, because of stigmatisation, do not want to be interviewed, but believe you me, they are going through a lot of financial challenges. Their treatment is often interrupted. They go today and tomorrow, and then they have to take a long break, and that doesn’t help them. So we are trying to raise money.

"Akandoh: Over 160,000 untreated HIV cases threaten Ghanas 2030 AIDS target","The Ministry of Health has raised the alarm over Ghana’s low HIV/AIDS treatment coverage, warning that the persistent treatment gap threatens the country’s efforts to control the epidemic.Presenting Ghana’s 2024 National HIV Estimates at the 23rd International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA 2025), Health Minister Kwabena Mintah Akandoh revealed that the country recorded 15,290 new infections and over 12,000 AIDS-related deaths last year. Of the 334,721 people living with HIV, more than 18,000 are children under 15.Despite this burden, only 47.5% of adults and 35.8% of children living with HIV are currently on treatment, the Minister said, describing the shortfall as the single biggest barrier to achieving epidemic control.Highlighting the broader implications, Mintah Akandoh emphasised the urgent need to address inequalities that hinder access to treatment. Key populations, including female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender people, still face significant obstacles due to stigma and discrimination within the health system.The Minister also drew attention to the vulnerability of young people, noting that adolescents and youth aged 10 to 24 account for nearly one-third of all new infections. Adolescent girls and young women remain disproportionately affected due to persistent gender inequalities, a trend he described as deeply troubling and a major driver of the treatment gap.Despite some progress — including a 90% treatment success rate among those currently enrolled in care and a 99.3% prevention-of-mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) rate — more than 160,000 diagnosed individuals remain untreated. Kwabena Mintah Akandoh warned that this poses a significant challenge to achieving Ghana’s 2030 goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat.“Our 2024 national estimates reveal both impressive progress and serious challenges,” he said. “Ghana has approximately 334,721 people living with HIV, including over 18,000 children under 15. Adult prevalence stands at 1.49%, with 15,290 new infections and 12,614 AIDS-related deaths recorded last year. Encouragingly, those on treatment have reached 90%, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission stands at 99.3%.”Tags: AIDSAkandohGhana NewsHealth Ministry",Sarah Appiah,,"December 5, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/akandoh-over-160000-untreated-hiv-cases-threaten-ghanas-2030-aids-target/
"Ghana to boost domestic HIV/AIDS response, Cut reliance on foreign supplies  VEEP","The government has reaffirmed its commitment to combating HIV/AIDS and reducing Ghana’s dependence on external sources for medicines and vaccines.Vice President Professor Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, speaking at the 23rd International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA 2025) in Accra, noted that while 65 percent of people living with HIV are on treatment, adolescent girls and young women continue to account for a disproportionate share of new infections.She highlighted the development of a National HIV Response Sustainability Roadmap aimed at securing domestic financing, expanding local production of HIV-related commodities, vaccines, and essential medicines, and reducing reliance on foreign supplies.“Government is committed to fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS and reducing dependence on external sources. Our national approach pillars include: sustainable and predictable financing. The National HIV Response Sustainability Roadmap is being developed to secure domestic financing and strengthen accountability. Local pharmaceutical manufacturing: a feasibility study is already underway to enable local production of HIV vaccines, commodities, and essential medicines, thus reducing dependency on external supplies,” she said.Prof. Opoku-Agyemang urged African countries to build on existing gains in HIV/AIDS prevention amid shrinking global support.“With global support shrinking, Africa must refuse to let its hard gains unravel. This is our chance to be bold, rethink, redesign and rebuild a sustainable financial foundation for the next generation of health security. If Africa must earn it, we must need our own response, we must strengthen domestic financing, build regional pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, enhance disease surveillance and laboratory systems, empower communities and civil society organisations,” she said.She further stressed the importance of investing in prevention and self-testing measures to curb the spread of HIV and warned that diseases such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis continue to threaten Africa’s economic growth.The Vice President also called on private individuals and institutions to partner with the government by investing in local vaccine and drug manufacturing and financing efforts to support disease control and vaccine development. …..Explore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!Click on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:

"Pepsodent, World Vision launch nationwide oral health drive for 25,000 children","World Vision Ghana and Unilever Ghana’s Pepsodent brand have rolled out a nationwide oral health campaign targeting more than 25,000 children in underserved communities.The year-long initiative, sealed with a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), aims to improve oral hygiene, reduce infections, and equip children with lifelong habits for healthy teeth.The World Health Organisation reports that oral diseases affect 3.5 billion people globally, nearly 45% of the world’s population. In Ghana, recent studies show that even districts with more dental personnel still record high levels of gum disease, tooth loss, and poor oral hygiene.

The campaign is expected to help close these gaps through preventive education, accessible screenings and strengthened community awareness, ensuring thousands of children begin life with healthier smiles and brighter futures.The campaign will directly reach school children and indirectly support over 30,000 community members, including 2,000 families in both northern and southern Ghana.Speaking during the MOU signing, National Director of World Vision Ghana, Tinah Mukundah, said, “It holds great promise for improving oral and dental hygiene among children and their families, especially young girls. Together, we’re building healthier futures for Ghana’s next generation.”The nationwide rollout will feature a series of community and school-based activities, including: Oral health day celebrations to raise awareness, brush twice daily” campaigns to reinforce good brushing habits and outreach programmes offering education and free oral screenings.World Vision Ghana will lead community engagement and behaviour change efforts, while Unilever provides product support and technical expertise from its Pepsodent portfolio.Tags: Ghana NewsORALPepsodentUnilever GhanaWorld Vision",Kennedy Odame Twumasi,,"December 4, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/pepsodent-world-vision-launch-nationwide-oral-health-drive-for-25000-children/

"Govt reviewing, not ending Zipline contract  Hamza Suhuyini","A member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) communication team, Hamza Suhuyini, has debunked claims that the government is planning to terminate Ghana’s contract with Zipline, insisting that ongoing reviews are aimed at ensuring value for money and strengthening such service, not scrapping it.Speaking on Channel One TV’s Breakfast Daily on Wednesday, December 3, he stated that the previous administration failed to establish proper monitoring mechanisms to track Zipline’s operations, resulting in inefficiencies that the current government is committed to correcting.“What kind of mechanisms did they put in place to guide them? The more Zipline flies, the more we pay them. So how were we monitoring these supplies?” he questioned.He argued that the absence of adequate oversight systems created room for wasteful spending, stressing that the new administration would not repeat those mistakes.“What kind of infrastructure did they have to ensure value for money? Absolutely none. A new responsible government has come into office, and you want us to continue in that trajectory of taking things for granted? Nobody has said anywhere that we are going to terminate the Zipline contract. Indeed, there are people in the NDC who may wish that, but as far as I am concerned, no such decision has been taken,” he clarified.According to him, the focus is on evaluating the data, engaging Zipline, and ensuring the company fulfils its core mandate effectively. He maintained that the government recognises the importance of the drone delivery system, particularly for district-level emergency services.“All we are saying is that we need to look into the numbers and possibly engage Zipline to live up to its mandate. The importance of such a system is not lost on the government. Its magnitude, especially at the district level, should not be underestimated. We will do everything within our power to ensure that we have such a service in the system, even if it is not Zipline as a company,” he added.His comments come amid heightened political debate over the sustainability of Zipline’s medical drone operations.Recently, Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga called for the termination of the contract, describing the programme as a “total waste of state resources.”The Health Minister, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh has also stated that Zipline was delivering non essential drugs including condoms, mosquito nets and education materials.Tags: AkandohGhana NewsHamza SuhuyiniHealth MinistryMahama AyarigaNDCNPPZipline",Patricia Boakye,,"December 3, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/govt-reviewing-not-ending-zipline-contract-hamza-suhuyini/
"GMA: Poor facilities, limited incentives hampering rural doctor deployment","The President of the Ghana Medical Association (GMA), Professor Ernest Yorke, has highlighted the persistent challenges preventing newly posted medical doctors from reporting to underserved areas, calling for urgent government intervention to provide both incentives and adequate facilities.The concerns come after the Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, granted newly assigned doctors an additional week to report to their duty stations following what he described as an “alarming” nationwide refusal to take up postings.Mr. Akandoh revealed that initial reporting figures were “not encouraging,” with seven out of every ten newly posted doctors failing to report.The situation is particularly acute in the Upper West and Upper East regions, which recorded no arrivals as of Friday, November 28.Speaking on Joy FM on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, Prof Yorke noted that while many doctors are willing to take up their posts, issues related to remuneration, incentives, and working conditions discourage them from reporting to deprived areas.“The situation is a classic chicken-and-egg scenario, which can go either way. There could be an incentive leading to the sacrifice, or we can have the sacrifice leading to the incentive, or we can do both at the same time. I would go for the latter,” he said.“We are calling on our members to continue sacrificing and accepting postings, but we are asking that the government appreciate their acceptance.”Prof Yorke emphasised that postings to deprived areas should come with appropriate incentives.“If you go to a developed place and if you accept postings to a much more deprived area, there is an incentive for you. It has been done elsewhere, and it is doable here as well,” he said, adding that the Ministry of Health already has a document called the Deprived Area Incentive, developed by the GMA, which is yet to be implemented.He further cited limited opportunities for post-graduate training in these regions, sometimes requiring doctors to pay significant sums to become specialists.Beyond manpower, Prof Yorke stressed the need for adequate medical facilities, pointing to the unfinished projects under Agenda 111.“It is not just the human manpower that is needed; it is also the facilities to work with. Can we partner with private persons to complete these facilities so that we can get them running?” he asked.According to Prof Yorke, while posting acceptance rates in Greater Accra, Central, and Ashanti regions have been satisfactory, the rest of the country continues to face critical shortages.He urged the government to engage in dialogue with the public to find practical solutions that would ensure medical care reaches deprived communities.Akandoh gives newly posted doctors one week to report to workTags: DoctorsGhana NewsGMAheadlineHealthKwabena Mintah AkandohProfessor Ernest Yorke",William Narh,,"December 3, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/gma-poor-facilities-limited-incentives-hampering-rural-doctor-deployment/
GES interdicts Dzodze-Penyi SHS headmaster over alleged sexual misconduct,"The Ghana Education Service (GES) has directed the Headmaster of Dzodze-Penyi Senior High School, Mr. Joshua Vidzro, to step aside from his duties with immediate effect.The directive, issued on Saturday, December 6, 2025, follows allegations of the Headmaster’s involvement in sexual misconduct with some female students at the school.According to the GES, the interdiction is necessary to ensure the integrity of the investigative process and prevent any perceived interference.Mr. Vidzro has been instructed to formally hand over all official duties, responsibilities, records, and any property belonging to Dzodze-Penyi SHS that are under his custody to the Municipal Director of Education for Ketu North.He is expected to vacate the school premises on Monday, December 8, 2025, after completing the handover.Despite stepping aside, Mr. Vidzro must remain available to assist the authorities with the investigation and is prohibited from any direct or indirect contact with the female students involved or any potential witnesses.The GES emphasised, “For the avoidance of doubt, this directive does not constitute a determination or presumption of guilt on your part, but is an administrative measure issued in furtherance of due process and institutional accountability.”The Municipal Director of Education for Ketu North has been tasked with overseeing the administration and management of Dzodze-Penyi SHS until further notice.Tags: GESGhana NewsHeadmaster of Dzodze-Penyi Senior High SchoolMr. Joshua Vidzrosexual misconduct",Leticia Osei,,"December 7, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/ges-interdicts-dzodze-penyi-shs-headmaster-over-alleged-sexual-misconduct/
Support private medical institutions  Prof. Adei to govt,"Chairman of the Council at the Accra College of Medicine, Professor Emeritus Stephen Adei, has called on the government to establish a dedicated national policy framework to strengthen the contribution of private tertiary institutions to Ghana’s development.Speaking at the 6th Congregation and 10th Anniversary celebration of the Accra College of Medicine (ACM), Prof. Adei revealed that the University of Ghana Medical School received about 4,000 applications this year but could admit only 150 students.He said this persistent admissions gap underscores the need for government to partner with private medical schools to absorb qualified applicants who are turned away due to limited public capacity. Such collaboration, he noted, would ease the state’s burden of building additional medical training institutions while expanding the country’s pool of medical professionals.“Ghana has reached a stage where we have over 90 accredited private institutions. There is therefore the need for a dedicated policy and agenda by the state to enhance the contribution of private universities and colleges,” he said.…..Explore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!Click on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:

"IMANI Africa: WASSCE decline exposes systemic flaws, full review of education needed","President of IMANI Africa, Franklin Cudjoe, has called for a comprehensive review of Ghana’s education system following the sharp drop in performance in the 2025 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), particularly in Core Mathematics and Social Studies.Official figures show that Core Mathematics recorded the steepest decline, with A1–C6 passes falling from 305,132 in 2024 to 209,068 in 2025—a decrease of over 96,000. With a pass rate of just 48.73%, more than half of candidates failed to attain grades required for tertiary education.Speaking on Channel One TV’s The Big Issue on Saturday, December 6, Mr. Cudjoe stressed the need for serious introspection in the country’s education system.He highlighted challenges including students’ poor understanding of exam content, a shortage of qualified teachers, and limited time for exam preparation.“I think what is going on is a record of the way we organise exams in this country. You have just a limited period of time to engage the teachers. Not all schools are endowed in getting good teachers. I think it’s important we look at this matter of understanding what the students are learning. I have a strong suspicion that they don’t even understand what they are learning or reading, most of them,” he said.Mr. Cudjoe further called for a “holistic or 360 look” at the entire educational sector, noting that frequent changes in ministers have contributed to policy instability.“It goes to how instructions are delivered. It’s not surprising. I think there must be some sort of serious introspection. Sometimes I read, see, and hear, and it’s worrying. There has to be some holistic or probably a 360 look at the whole educational sector. It’s troubling,” he added. …..Explore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!Click on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:

Elon Musks X bans European Commission from making ads after 120m fine,"X has blocked the European Commission from making adverts on its platform – a move which comes a few days after it fined Elon Musk’s site €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges.Nikita Bier, who has a senior role at the social media site, accused the European Union (EU) regulator of trying to “take advantage” of “an exploit” in its advertising system to promote its post about the fine on Friday.“It seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account,” he said. “Your ad account has been terminated.”A European Commission spokesperson told BBC News the Commission “always uses all social media platforms in good faith”.X’s fine, issued on Friday, was the first under the EU’s Digital Services Act.The EU regulator said the platform’s blue tick system was “deceptive” because the firm was not “meaningfully verifying users”.“This deception exposes users to scams, including impersonation frauds, as well as other forms of manipulation by malicious actors,” it said.It claimed X was also failing to provide transparency around its adverts and was not giving researchers access to public data.The social media platform has been given 60 days to respond to the Commission about concerns surrounding its blue checkmarks, or face extra penalties.Following the fine, Elon Musk posted on his platform to say the EU “should be abolished”, and retweeted a response from another X user comparing it to fascism.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms, adding, “the days of censoring Americans online are over”.‘Never been abused like this’

The dispute originated with Mr Bier, who accused the Commission of activating a rarely-used account “to take advantage of an exploit”.He claimed it had posted a link which itself deceived users – tricking them into thinking it was a video “to artificially increase its reach”.He said the “exploit”, which had “never been abused like this”, had now been removed.Ad accounts on X are used by businesses to create and analyse paid advertising campaigns and run “promoted” posts on the site, separate from the users’ X profiles.In response, a European Commission spokesperson told BBC News that it was “simply using the tools that platforms themselves are making available to our corporate accounts”.“⁠We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms’ own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework,” it said.And it is not the first time there has been disagreement between X and global regulators.In 2024, Brazil’s Supreme Court lifted a ban on X after it agreed to pay 28 million reais ($5.1m; £3.8m), and blocked accounts accused of spreading misinformation.The previous year, Australia’s internet safety watchdog fined it A$610,000 ($386,000; £317,360) for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.Source: BBC Tags: Elon MuskEUTech newsX",Citi Newsroom,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/elon-musks-x-bans-european-commission-from-making-ads-after-e120m-fine/
Elon Musk calls for abolition of European Union after X fined $140m,"Elon Musk has called for the European Union to be abolished after the bloc fined his social media company X 120 million euros ($140 million) for a “deceptive” blue checkmark and lack of transparency of its advertising repository.The European Commission hit X with the ruling on Friday following a two-year investigation into the company under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which was adopted in 2022 to regulate online platforms. At the time, in a reply on X to a post from the Commission, Musk wrote, “Bulls—.”On Saturday, he stepped up his criticism of the bloc. “The EU should be abolished, and sovereignty returned to individual countries, so that governments can better represent their people,” he said in a post on X.Musk’s comments come as top U.S. government officials have also intensified their opposition to the decision.Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the fine an “attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments,” in a post on X on Friday.“Today’s excessive €120M fine is the result of EU regulatory overreach targeting American innovation,” said Andrew Puzder, the U.S. ambassador to the EU, on X on Saturday.“The Trump Administration has been clear: we oppose censorship and will challenge burdensome regulations that target US companies abroad. We expect the EU to engage in fair, open, & reciprocal trade — & nothing less.”Last week, the Commission said breaches included “the deceptive design of its ‘blue checkmark,’ the lack of transparency of its advertising repository, and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.”“With the DSA’s first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users’ rights and evading accountability,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, at the time.X now has 60 days to inform the Commission of plans to address the issues with “deceptive” blue checkmarks. It has 90 days to submit a plan to resolve the issues with its ads repository and access to its public data for researchers.“Failure to comply with the non-compliance decision may lead to periodic penalty payments,” the Commission said in a statement.Source: CNBCTags: Elon MuskEUGhana NewsTech newsX",Citi Newsroom,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/elon-musk-calls-for-abolition-of-european-union-after-x-fined-140m/
"Govt prioritises digital inclusion with 50,000 fully funded tech training slots","Government is prioritising inclusive digital growth next year with a major push to equip vulnerable consumers with employable tech skills, announcing 50,000 fully funded training slots for persons with disabilities under the One Million Coders Programme.The move comes as the Communications and Digital Technology Ministry ramps up efforts to make digital services more accessible and affordable amid rising demand for online business and public services.Speaking at the 2025 International Day of Persons with Disabilities celebration, Communications Minister Samuel Nartey George outlined a series of measures aimed at enforcing accessibility and easing the cost burden on consumers.“We will strengthen accessibility standards. We will enforce accessibility across all government digital platforms, ensuring compliance with global standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Two, we will advance affordability and accessible communications,” he said.He added that government is working with the NCA and telecom operators to improve service access and industry support. “Working with the NCA and our telecom partners, we will pursue concessionary data options, accessible customer service channels, and encourage industry actors to invest in inclusive technologies.”“Under the stewardship or guidance of the Ministry for Gender, Children and Social Protection, as we roll out the One Million Coders programme next year, we will dedicate 50,000 training allocations fully paid for to persons with disabilities.

Russia blocks Apples FaceTime in mounting push against foreign tech platforms,"Russia has blocked Apple’s video-calling app FaceTime, the state communications watchdog said on Thursday, as part of an accelerating clampdown on foreign tech platforms that authorities allege are being used for criminal activity.The move follows restrictions against Google’s YouTube, Meta’s WhatsApp and the Telegram messaging service.Critics say the curbs amount to censorship and a tightening of state control over private communications. Russia says they are legitimate law enforcement measures.Russian authorities have this year launched a state-backed rival app called MAX, which critics say could be used for surveillance – allegations that state media have dismissed as false.Justifying its decision, the communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in an emailed statement: “According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens.”The watchdog did not cite evidence in support of the allegations.Apple representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the blocking of FaceTime, an app that enables users to make free video and audio calls over Wi-Fi or cellular data.Moscow residents who tried FaceTime on Thursday reported seeing an on-screen message saying “User unavailable”.Another also said, “A friend that I tried to contact had seen the incoming call but was unable to connect”.In recent months, Roskomnadzor has intensified measures to block access to Western media and tech platforms it says are hosting content that breaches Russian laws.In August, Russia began limiting some calls on WhatsApp and Telegram, accusing them of refusing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. Roskomnadzor last week threatened to block WhatsApp completely.On Wednesday, Roskomnadzor blocked access to the U.S. children’s gaming platform Roblox (RBLX.N), accusing it of distributing extremist materials and “LGBT propaganda”. Roblox said it respects the laws of countries where it operates and is deeply committed to ensuring users’ safety. Source: ReutersTags: AppleFace timeRussiaTech news",Citi Newsroom,,"December 4, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/russia-blocks-apples-facetime-in-mounting-push-against-foreign-tech-platforms/
Porn company fined 1m over inadequate age checks,"Ofcom has fined a porn company £1m for failing to put in place sufficiently robust age checks – the biggest penalty it has imposed so far under the Online Safety Act.The Act makes it a legal requirement for websites that host pornographic material to put in place what the regulator determines to be “highly effective age assurance” to prevent children from being able to easily access explicit content.Ofcom said AVS Group Ltd, which runs 18 adult websites, had failed to do this, so was being fined £1m, plus £50,000 for failing to respond to information requests.AVS must now implement highly effective age assurance within 72 hours or face a daily additional penalty of £1,000 a day.In addition to the AVS fine, Ofcom also announced that one “major social media company” was going through compliance remediation with its enforcement team.The regulator has not named the platform but says there may be formal action if it does not see sufficient improvement soon.Ofcom said the fine showed the “tide on online safety” was beginning to turn.“This year has seen important changes for people, with new measures across many sites and apps now better protecting children from harmful content,” said Oliver Griffiths, Ofcom’s online safety group director.“But we need to see much more from tech companies next year and we’ll use our full powers if they fall short,” he added.Ofcom has already started issuing fines to some companies for not implementing proper age verification, including deepfake “nudify” applications.However, online message board 4Chan has so far refused to comply with a £20,000 fine issued by Ofcom over the summer.The Online Safety Act is being implemented in phases, and is intended to prevent past practices which Ofcom described as online platforms being “unregulated, unaccountable and often unwilling to prioritise people’s safety over profits”.Tougher age checks for porn websites were introduced in July, though some people have pointed out these could be easily avoided with a virtual private network (VPN), which reroutes internet traffic.In October, Pornhub’s parent company told BBC News it had seen a 77% drop in UK visitors since the age checks had come in.Baroness Beeban Kidron, founder of 5Rights Foundation, told the Today programme the fines were “nothing” to tech firms.“Business disruption is everything,” she said.“Unless we’re prepared to use the law, they’re not really doing what Parliament asked them to do.“We need a whole different attitude about the level of intensity and robustness from the regulator to say – we’ve got the law, and we’re using it.”Also introduced this year were tougher guidelines on ensuring the internet was safer for women and girls, with Ofcom vowing to name and shame platforms that did not comply.Critics say the Act needs to be toughened to make the internet safer, particularly for women and girls.Source: BBCTags: BritainOfcomporn companyTech news",Citi Newsroom,,"December 4, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/porn-company-fined-1m-over-inadequate-age-checks/
South Korea developing app that shows real-time location of stalkers,"South Korean authorities are developing a mobile app for stalking victims to track in real-time the location of their stalkers, if they’re nearby.The app, announced by South Korea’s justice ministry on Wednesday, December 4, is part of an approved amendment to the country’s electronic monitoring law.Stalkers have become a subject of public concern in South Korea, especially as high-profile crimes involving stalking have made headlines in recent years.Under the current law, stalking victims can receive text message alerts when their stalkers are nearby – though these do not reveal stalkers’ exact locations.This makes it difficult for victims to determine the direction of the perpetrator, the justice ministry said in a statement.Under the revised law, victims will be allowed to see their stalker’s location on a map with their smartphones, allowing them to evacuate to safety.Authorities track stalkers’ whereabouts using wearable electronic devices.The justice ministry said it was also working on integrating the tracking system into the national emergency hotline, so police could be deployed to protect victims as needed.This integration is expected to be completed next year, local media reported.Critics have voiced concern over the pervasiveness of stalking in South Korea, which they see as part of a wider problem of violence against women, many of whom have been secretly filmed by spy cameras and faced hostile threats for being feminists.In 2022, public anger erupted over the murder of a young woman by her male ex-colleague, who had been stalking her for years. Although she had reported him to the police, he was not detained or given a restraining order as authorities viewed him as “low risk”.In 2021, South Korea introduced an anti-stalking law that carries up to three years of jail for offenders and a maximum fine of 30 million Korean won ($20,400; £15,300).In 2023, South Korea’s parliament revised the law to lower the barrier to prosecuting stalkers.The number of reports against stalkers has surged since then, from 7,600 in 2022 to more than 13,000 last year, according to data from the justice ministry. Source: BBCTags: South KoreastalkingTech news",Citi Newsroom,,"December 4, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/south-korea-developing-app-that-shows-real-time-location-of-stalkers/
YouTube says it will comply with Australias teen social media ban,"Google’s YouTube shared a “disappointing update” to millions of Australian users and content creators on Wednesday, saying it will comply with a world-first teen social media ban by locking out users aged under 16 from their accounts within days.The decision ends a stand-off between the internet giant and the Australian government, which initially exempted YouTube from the age restriction, citing its use for educational purposes. Google had said it was getting legal advice about how to respond to being included.“Viewers must now be 16 or older to sign into YouTube,” the company said in a statement.“This is a disappointing update to share. This law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube.”The Australian ban is being closely watched by other jurisdictions considering similar age-based measures, setting up a potential global precedent for how the mostly U.S. tech giants behind the biggest platforms balance child safety with access to digital services.The Australian government says the measure responds to mounting evidence that platforms are failing to do enough to protect children from harmful content.SIGNED OUTYouTube said any user aged under 16 would be automatically signed out of their account from December 10, meaning they could no longer subscribe, like or comment on posts although they could still view content logged out.That meant underage content creators also could not log in or post. YouTube did not say how it would verify someone’s age.The company also reiterated its position that the ban would not make the internet safer, and said in an email to caregivers of underage users that “parental controls only work when your pre-teen or teen is signed in, so the settings you’ve chosen will no longer apply”.Communications Minister Anika Wells, speaking to reporters in Canberra, said it was “weird that YouTube is always at pains to remind us all how unsafe their platform is in a logged-out state”.“If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe and there’s content not appropriate for age-restricted users on their website, that’s a problem that YouTube needs to fix.”The law prohibits platforms from allowing under-16s to hold accounts, with penalties of up to A$49.5 million ($32.5 million) for breaches. Meta’s  Facebook and Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat previously said they would comply.Of the platforms named by the government as being covered by the ban, only Elon Musk’s X and message board Reddit have not publicly committed to abide by the law.Wells, asked about reports of lesser-known social media apps growing in popularity, said the tech industry was “dynamic” and the government’s list of affected platforms “will need to expand as different platforms receive migratory patterns”.YouTube has 325,000 accounts held by Australians aged 13 to 15, according to the regulator, the eSafety Commissioner, behind only Snapchat, which has 440,000 and Instagram, which has 350,000 in that age range.eSafety has said more than one-third of Australians aged 10 to 15 have reported seeing harmful content on YouTube, the worst of any platform.Source: ReutersTags: AustraliaGhana NewsSocial Media banTech newsYouTube",Citi Newsroom,,"December 3, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/youtube-says-it-will-comply-with-australias-teen-social-media-ban/
Replacing Mercator with Equal-Earth: 456 years of cartographic distortion of Africa and Greenland,"Africa is on a fierce campaign that, if successful, will see the Mercator map replaced with the Equal Earth map on web-based platforms, mobile apps, desktop software, and embedded systems for our home planet, Earth.Most web-based platforms including Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Bing Maps still use the 16th-century Mercator projection for their maps.The Mercator map, created in 1569 by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator, was purposefully designed to facilitate navigation. Over time, however, it has been used in many other fields far beyond its original intent.Even though this map maintains the angles and directions between geographic locations, it shrinks the actual size of continents near the equator (e.g., Africa, South America) while exaggerating areas near the poles (e.g., North America, Greenland).This distortion does not sit well with two African civil society organizations, Africa No Filter and Speak Up Africa, who are urging policymakers, educational institutions, and media platforms to “stop using distorted projections” and promote a more accurate world map.Their campaign, with the heartbeat slogan #CorrectTheMap, caught the attention of the African Union (AU), which has since backed the move. “It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not,” said AU Deputy Chairperson Selma Malika Haddadi.Supporters of the campaign argue that replacing the Mercator map is a matter of correcting a historical visual injustice that has perpetuated colonial legacies and skewed perceptions of the continent’s importance.The core of their argument is now the subject of a petition awaiting determination at the United Nations Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) body.For the meantime, this scientific piece seeks to show the scorecard of the ‘fight’ to replace the Mercator map with the Equal Earth map; the significance of projections in mapping; the successes, the politics, and what lies ahead.Mapping a polar-flattened sphere on paper: the Science of ProjectionOur planet Earth, the third rocky planet after Mercury and Venus respectively in the solar system, is not a perfect sphere but rather slightly flattened at both the northern and southern poles.As a result, mapping such a polar-flattened sphere onto a flat surface demands some key compromises.Generally, a map is a symbolic representation of selected characteristics of a place, usually drawn on a flat surface. Maps teach about the world by showing the sizes and shapes of countries, the locations of features, and the distances between places.Transferring information from the spherical, or ball-shaped, surface of Earth onto a flat piece of paper is called projection. Projection is a major challenge for mapmakers (cartographers), and every map has some sort of distortion.Trying to project Earth’s surface onto a flat plane is like trying to flatten an orange peel without tearing or stretching it. In other words, transferring a three-dimensional (3D) sphere onto a two-dimensional (2D) paper will inevitably introduce distortion.You can’t mathematically preserve all geographic properties at once. Every projection must compromise between four key properties: Area/size, shape, distance and direction.Replacing Mercator with Equal Earth – 4-propertiesThe reason all four properties cannot be preserved in a single projection is formalized in Gauss’s Theorema Egregium. It proves that you cannot map a curved surface to a flat one without distortion.Gauss’s theorem shows that the curvature of a surface is intrinsic and can be measured using only distances and angles on the surface, without needing to view it from outside. This means you can’t flatten a curved surface like a sphere onto a plane without distortion, because their curvatures are fundamentally different.Mathematically, the Gaussian curvature (K) is computed from the surface’s first and second fundamental forms. The formula proves that curvature depends only on the surface’s internal geometry, not its shape in space.Therefore, every flat map of the Earth must distort something either area, shape, distance, or direction simply because it’s impossible to preserve all four simultaneously.Replacing Mercator with Equal Earth – 3-map-projectionsMap projections: The elephant in the roomThere are hundreds of map projections that can be succinctly summarized into three major types: Cylindrical, Conical, and Azimuthal map projections.The Mercator map of the Earth was made using the cylindrical projection and is well known for its distortion near the polar regions.Figure 1 illustrates how each of these projection types differ from one to another. Cylindrical projections wrap the globe as if around a cylinder, conical projections use a cone, and azimuthal projections flatten from a single point, each with its own trade-offs in distortion.The Mercator Projection: Navigation’s gift, Geography’s curseThe Mercator projection, now 456 years old, remains one of the most recognizable world maps. Top panel in Figure 2 shows the Mercator map with orange circles aligned along lines of latitude and longitude. The size of these circles increases toward the poles while remaining smaller near the equator.Clearly, regions closer to the poles appear much larger than they actually are. For instance, Greenland and Antarctica look disproportionately large compared to equatorial regions like Africa.In reality, Greenland has a total area of 2,166,086 km², while Africa, the world’s second-largest continent, covers 30,365,000 km² making Africa fourteen times bigger than Greenland. Yet, these surfaces are not accurately represented on the Mercator projection.To highlight Africa’s true size, the African Union recently shared a map of Africa with the outlines of eleven (11) major countries drawn inside it for scale including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Spain, Portugal, China, Peru, and India.This visual reminder underscores how Mercator’s legacy continues to shape global perception.The Rise of the Equal-Earth ProjectionThe Equal-Earth map projection is an equal-area pseudocylindrical global map projection. It was invented by Bojan Šavrič, Bernhard Jenny, and Tom Patterson in 2018 to better reflect the true proportions of continents while maintaining a visually appealing shape (bottom panel, Figure 2).The curved sides of this projection suggest the spherical form of Earth. The central meridian is straight, while others are curved to better balance distortion. The parallels are straight, making it easy to compare how far north or south places are from the equator.Unlike the Mercator projection, Equal Earth ensures that each region’s relative area is preserved, offering both fairness and realism.Replacing Mercator with Equal Earth – Cylindrical-vs-PseudocylindricalThe Gains thus far: NASA and the World Bank lead the wayPalpable evidence of the #CorrectTheMap campaign’s impact has been seen on two major fronts: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the World Bank.NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) adopted the Equal-Earth projection in 2018 for its global climate anomaly maps, prioritizing area accuracy and visual equity.The World Bank followed suit in 2019, gradually integrating Equal Earth into its thematic cartography to better represent development data across regions.These early adoptions mark a slow but significant shift toward a more balanced world view, literally and metaphorically.The political ghost in MappingIn his August 2020 article “The Map Is Never Neutral,” Walker D. Mills argues that maps are often “political arguments,” and therefore strategists must learn to interpret them as such.He illustrates this point with several examples: Morocco has used maps to dispute its border with Algeria and justify its effective annexation of Western Sahara (Zunes & Mundy, 2010). Similarly, Guatemala refuses to recognize its boundary with Belize, while Argentina continues to claim the Falkland Islands, known locally as the Islas Malvinas, on its national maps (Neuman, 2012).Mills’ observations echo those of Hartley, who noted that “as much as guns and warships, maps have been weapons of imperialism… used to legitimize the reality of conquest and empire.”Maps have always carried political weight, and nowhere is this more evident today than in debates over whether or not the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war could lead to a redrawing of Ukraine’s borders. As the conflict continues to reshape geopolitical realities, it raises the difficult question of who ultimately gets to decide how a nation is mapped.These perspectives, among others, underscore the historical and ongoing use of cartography as a means of control and persuasion. With the rise of digital mapping technologies, the potential for maps to shape political narratives and even deceive has only intensified.It is therefore not far-fetched to argue that the persistent use of the Mercator projection carries a subtle layer of political undertone, one that continues to reinforce historical hierarchies of power and perception.Changing to a true view of our planet, EarthAs the world awaits the opinion and directive from the United Nations Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM), it would be precipitous to conclude that the Mercator map has outlived its purpose.The Mercator retains its usefulness in the world of sea navigation, the purpose for which it was made. However, after more than four and a half centuries of use, it behoves the world to embrace change.afrA change to the Equal Earth projection, one that maps continents and countries of our planet respecting their true sizes. A change that is more accurate, as in the eye of a bird flying over these vast landmasses.A change to an Equal Earth map that is more just, devoid of historical visual injustice. A change that presents a world map to a young girl in New Cairo City from a neutral and educative point of view.A change that reassures a primary school boy in Ho, Volta Region that a map of Africa made in Ghana is the same as that used by a teacher in Greenland. A change that reflects how much knowledge we have acquired over these past 456 years of mapping, how many data we have collected from numerous satellites and through space missions.A change that resonates with our present realities.–The writer, Eli Djomekou is a Science Communicator and Graduate in Earth and Planetary Sciences.Tags: AfricaGhana News",Citi Newsroom,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/replacing-mercator-with-equal-earth-456-years-of-cartographic-distortion-of-africa-and-greenland/
Open letter to IGP on misreported assassination attempt in Obuasi -Ernest Kofi Offen writes,"Dear Inspector General of Police, Christian Tetteh Yohonu,
I trust this letter finds you well as you continue your exceptional service to our nation. As an advocate of good governance, responsible citizenship, and media accountability, I have followed your firm stance on policing irresponsible commentary within the media landscape. Many may disagree with your approach, but for some of us, your intervention has been both timely and necessary.Freedom of speech—though guaranteed under the 1992 Constitution—comes with a critical caveat: where one person’s freedom ends, another’s begins. Recklessness is not a constitutional right, and the state must act when misinformation threatens public safety and national cohesion.Your swift responses in recent years have saved lives, protected property, and reminded citizens—especially media practitioners—of their responsibilities.
It is in this spirit that I write to draw your attention to a disturbing development in Obuasi.When Irresponsible Reporting Becomes a Threat: A Reminder From Subriso
Sir, allow me to recount an incident I personally witnessed during my nine-year service as Information Officer at Tepa.At Subriso, in the Ahafo Ano North Municipality, a community information centre operator irresponsibly broadcast unverified claims that ritual murderers were at the local cemetery. His call for residents to arm themselves and storm the cemetery triggered chaos. An innocent man returning from his farm was attacked by the mob; he survived only by grace and timely intervention.
Had he died, whose fault would it have been? The community’s? No.
It would have been the fault of the broadcaster who failed to check his facts.
This is what happens when media practitioners abandon their duty to inform and instead incite.The Obuasi “Assassination Attempt” That Never Was
IGP Sir, let me now address the issue at hand.
On Saturday, 29th November 2025, reports circulated widely that there had been an assassination attempt on the Dompoasehene,Nana Okofo Kwabena Bonsu II, during a funeral in Obuasi. The claim—carried by two unpatriotic and irresponsible reporters—spread across Ghana like wildfire.
Sir, there was no assassination attempt.What happened, as your officers in Obuasi have already confirmed, was an accidental misfire from ceremonial musketry during the arrival of chiefs, a common feature of Akan funerals. The Dompoasehene was exchanging pleasantries when the musket accidentally discharged. He received prompt medical care and was discharged the same day.Yet these two reporters chose to sensationalise the incident, frame it as an assassination attempt, and drag Obuasi’s already sensitive security situation into national panic—simply for views and social media clout.Why This Matters: The Cost of Reckless Journalism in a Mining City
Sir, Obuasi is not an ordinary town. It is the economic spine of AngloGold Ashanti’s operations and a strategic investment hub for Ghana. The majority of investors here are foreign contractors and technical personnel. Any hint of insecurity—especially something as severe as an assassination attempt—has immediate consequences for investor confidence.The town is still recovering from illegal mining confrontations earlier this year that resulted in casualties and heightened tension. The last thing Obuasi needs is fabricated high-profile criminal narratives.To claim there was an assassination attempt on a chief is not merely irresponsible—it is economically dangerous.Such stories can destabilise investment, tarnish Obuasi’s reputation, and undermine national security.If anyone attempted an assassination in Obuasi, it is these two reporters—
assassins of truth, assassins of professionalism, and assassins of the future we are building for this city.Sir, We Need You to Act
Your officers’ report contradicts the false narrative pushed by these two individuals. Yet they continue to walk free without being questioned about the source of their claims.
Sir, if truly there were assassins targeting our chiefs, should the very reporters who “broke the news” not be the first to be invited by your office for interrogation?
Obuasi deserves fairness.
Obuasi deserves safety.
Obuasi deserves protection from reckless journalism.I therefore humbly call on your high office to:
1. Invite the two reporters for questioning regarding their allegation.
2. Demand evidence for their claims—if indeed there were assassins.
3. Apply the law as you have done in similar cases, to deter future misinformation.
4. Protect Obuasi’s image, which their sensationalism has attempted to damage.Until this is done, Sir, it becomes difficult for citizens to understand why others are arrested for similar offences while these individuals face no consequences.Conclusion
IGP, I commend your efforts in restoring dignity to the Ghana Police Service and ensuring responsible public discourse. I urge you to extend the same vigilance to this matter. The people of Obuasi deserve justice and protection from the spread of damaging falsehoods.
Obuasi deserves better.
Long live Adansiman.
Long live Obuasi.
Long live the Republic of Ghana.Yours sincerely,
Ernest Kofi Offen

Ghana cannot stay silent while 14 million medical records vanish into a digital void,"More than 14.2 million patient medical records, the very lifeline of health care in this country are now trapped in a digital blackout. And yet, Ghana remains eerily calm. No national uproar. No emergency parliamentary session. No presidential address. Just silence, as if losing years of sensitive medical data is a mild inconvenience and not a full-scale public health crisis.The Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS) was supposed to be our gateway to a modern health sector, a unified digital platform deployed across teaching, regional and district hospitals to replace the era of brown folders, missing files, and handwritten notes. It promised efficiency, speed, security and accuracy. Instead, it has become the epicentre of a disaster unfolding quietly in our hospitals.For weeks, doctors and nurses across the country have abandoned computers and picked up exercise books. Long queues snake through facilities, patients wait helplessly for care, and health workers struggle with handwritten folders as if the system never existed. Some hospitals confirm they have lost all patient data since 2023, treatment plans, medication history, diagnoses, lab results, everything.Yet we do not see the collective outrage this moment demands.The shutdown of LHIMS is a crisis of governance, accountability and national security. Medical data is not an optional convenience; it is the foundation of clinical decision-making. Without a patient’s medical history, a doctor is effectively treating blindly. Allergies are unknown. Past medications are uncertain. Previous diagnoses are guesswork.Imagine a patient in critical care whose last known medication interacts fatally with a new prescription. Imagine a cancer patient whose treatment plan disappears. Imagine a child whose allergy record cannot be found. These are not hypotheticals they are happening right now in wards across the country.The Ministry insists it demanded full control of the data something every sovereign state has the right to ensure. If this account is accurate, how did Ghana sign a contract that left national health data in the hands of a private contractor? Why were there no safeguards? Who failed to enforce the Data Protection Act? How did an entire health system become dependent on a vendor’s goodwill?Lightwave denies wrongdoing and claims the data is safely stored on local hospital servers and at the Ministry’s data centre in Accra. But if the data is so secure, why can’t hospitals access it? Why has care delivery collapsed? Why have patient histories vanished? Someone is not telling the full story and the public deserves the truth.The Data Protection Commission’s investigation began far too late, and even now the country is yet to see decisive action or clear conclusions. If this were banking data or voter information, Ghana would be in crisis mode. But health records the most intimate, sensitive and life-critical data we possess disappear, and the nation shrugs.The silence from civil society is also deafening. This is not just a health story; it is a national crisis. If 14.2 million banking records disappeared, the country would be in flames. If 14.2 million EC voter records vanished, Parliament would reconvene overnight. But 14.2 million health records? Ghana shrugs.This silence shows how deeply we belittle health data. We behave as though medical records are simply scribbles in a folder not the blueprint of a person’s life, medical trajectory, and survival. This is not only about LHIMS. It is a warning shot. If we do not demand accountability today, the same negligence will destroy future biometric systems, national IDs, tax platforms and digital public services.This crisis is far bigger than Lightwave and far bigger than the Ministry of Health. It is a national lesson in how easily a country loses what it fails to safeguard. Fourteen million medical records cannot disappear into a contractual dispute and be treated as business as usual. Ghana must demand answers, demand accountability, and reclaim its data because this silence is not only irresponsible. It is dangerous. And it is costing lives.By: Fred Tettey Djabanor, Head of Current Affairs at Channel One TV and Citi FMTags: Ghana News",Fred Tettey Djabanor,,"December 5, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/ghana-cannot-stay-silent-while-14-million-medical-records-vanish-into-a-digital-void/
