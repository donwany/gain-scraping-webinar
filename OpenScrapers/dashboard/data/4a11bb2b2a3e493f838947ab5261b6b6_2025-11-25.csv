2026 budget transformational breakthrough for red gold industry  Oil palm smallholders,"The Ghana Small Scale Oil Palm Producers Association, GOPPA, is applauding the 2026 Budget, describing it as a transformational turning point for the country’s oil palm industry.GOPPA says the launch of the National Policy on Integrated Oil Palm Development backed by a GH¢6.9 billion budget allocation and a US$500 million long-term finance window marks the strongest commitment yet to industrialise Ghana’s “Red Gold” sector.In a statement signed by  Kojo Obeng Berkoh, Executive Secretary of GOPPA, the Association noted that the new policy outlines major interventions, including the establishment of 100,000 hectares of new plantations, the creation of over 250,000 jobs, and expanded support for downstream processing and value addition.GOPPA also welcomed the outgrower partnership scheme, which offers smallholders high-yield seedlings, mechanisation, subsidised inputs, and guaranteed off-take agreements.The Association further praised the concessional US$500 million financing window, describing its five-year moratorium and long repayment structure as critical for a crop with a seven-year maturity cycle.It also lauded efforts to strengthen industry institutions such as the Tree Crops Development Authority, the Oil Palm Research Institute, and EXIM Bank.GOPPA says with its 3,000-member network targeted to grow to 20,000 in the next four years it stands ready to support the successful rollout of the policy and help position Ghana as a leading producer of sustainable palm oilTags: 2026 BudgetGhana NewsOil palm smallholdersRed gold industry",Philip Nii Lartey,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/2026-budget-transformational-breakthrough-for-red-gold-industry-oil-palm-smallholders/
Africa Centre for Tax Policy Research demands broader dialogue on new VAT reforms,"The Africa Centre for Tax Policy Research (ACTOR) is calling for a structured dialogue between the Ghana Union of Traders Associations (GUTA), the Ministry of Finance, and the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) over the government’s new VAT reforms and the planned rollout of AI systems at the ports.GUTA has raised concerns that the new VAT threshold of GH¢750,000, which requires businesses exceeding it to pay 20% VAT, could create unfair competition, splitting the market between traders who charge VAT and those who do not.Reacting to the call in a statement issued on 24th November, 2025, the policy think tank said the threshold is not ‘a sudden hike but a return to the long-standing real value of VAT entry points when Ghana’s volatile exchange rate is considered.’The think tank explained that VAT thresholds exist in Ghana and globally to protect small businesses and allow tax authorities to focus on medium and large taxpayers who generate most revenue.ACTOR noted that the dollar value of the threshold has remained stable over the years, with the proposed GH¢750,000 roughly equivalent to USD 62,500 within historical ranges. Their analysis also showed the real price difference between VAT-registered and non-registered traders is minimal about 1.5%.The think tank also disagreed with GUTA’s suggestion that all traders should be allowed to opt into the Modified Tax System (MTS), saying thresholds cannot be optional without risking system collapse. The MTS, ACTOR stressed, is meant only for micro and small businesses below the VAT threshold.While defending the reform, ACTOR acknowledged traders’ concerns and urged the GRA to strengthen monitoring and turnover verification to prevent VAT evasion. The group concluded that strong collaboration among stakeholders is key to a smooth rollout, minimising market distortions and building trust in the tax system.Tags: GUTATaxVAT reforms",Nerteley Nettey,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/africa-centre-for-tax-policy-research-demands-broader-dialogue-on-new-vat-reforms/
AGI Presidential hopeful Ralph Ayitey details strategy to cut $2bn food import bill,"Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) Presidential hopeful Ralph Ayitey is proposing a significant reduction in Ghana’s over-$2 billion food import bill by through a stronger consumer preference for locally produced foods.He maintains that a strong domestic demand base can help reduce import dependence and stabilize the sector.Ghana’s annual food import bill now exceeding $2 billion continues to mount pressure on foreign exchange reserves and deepen the country’s broader economic vulnerabilities.Industry watchers warn that without a decisive shift toward local consumption, the strain on the economy will persist.AGI Presidential hopeful and Chief Executive Officer of Coconut Grove Hotels, Ralph Ayitey, in an interview with Citi Business News argued that increasing patronage of Ghana-made food products offers a viable pathway to easing the burden.“It is very important that we try as much as possible to reduce the 2-2.5 billion import bill that we have on food. Most of the foods we consume take just about 3 months. Talk of maize, rice and millet. It is important we develop the appetite and consciousness to produce and consume what we have. When we do that we reduce the burden on our cedi,” he said.Beyond food consumption, Ralph Ayitey is also advocating a revitalisation of the cotton value chain to support existing textile factories, with trial activities expected to commence in January.“We want to gauge the productivity which is the output. But the emphasis here is that we are going quite mechanized but most importantly irrigated. We want to have two cycles in a year.“We are talking about feeding GTP, Akosombo Textiles and Printex. All of them put together consumer about 50 million yards of fabric a year. It is a whole industry and a whole gold mine that is waiting to be mined,” he added.Tags: AGI ElectionsFood Import BillGhana News",Daniel Sackitey,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/agi-presidential-hopeful-ralph-ayitey-details-strategy-to-cut-2bn-food-import-bill/
Diversified growth pushes Ghanas economy into expansion mode  BoG,"The Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr Johnson Asiama, has stated that the Ghanaian economy is now transitioning from a phase of recovery into a period of real expansion.According to him, several parts of the economy have performed better than expected, showing that growth momentum is now more widely distributed rather than driven by only a few industries.Speaking at the opening of the 127th Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 24th November, 2025, Dr. Asiama said economic activity has strengthened significantly this quarter, with growth becoming broader and more stable across multiple sectors.“What stands out this quarter is the broad momentum in economic activity. Growth has been stronger and more diversified than anticipated,” he said.The first half of the year recorded 6.3 percent GDP growth, propelled by strong performance in services and agriculture, while non-oil GDP rose to 7.8 percent. High-frequency indicators reinforce this trend, with the Composite Index of Economic Activity up about 9 percent, alongside continued optimism among businesses and consumers. These gains show that the negative output gap is narrowing and the economy is steadily shifting from recovery to expansion,” he added.Dr. Johnson Asiama stressed that the progress is the result of deliberate policy actions. He pointed to sustained fiscal discipline, a cautious but firm monetary policy approach, and structural reforms, especially in FX operations and rebuilding external buffers.He further noted that the 2026 Budget strengthens this discipline and places growth and job creation at the centre of Ghana’s next phase of economic transformation.This comes on the back of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Ghana (BoG) has beguns its 127th meeting today, November 24, 2025, with discussions expected to focus on key macroeconomic developments shaping the country’s recovery trajectory.It also comes at a time when inflation has also continued its downward path falling to 8 percent in October, driven by sustained tight monetary policy, fiscal consolidation, and improved food supply conditions.Tags: Bank of GhanaEconomyexpansionMPC",Nerteley Nettey,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/diversified-growth-pushes-ghanas-economy-into-expansion-mode-bog/
Banks face high-stakes push to hit 10% NPL by 2026  Deloitte,"Deloitte Ghana is warning that the Bank of Ghana’s push to cut non-performing loans to 10% by end-2026 is ambitious and will demand aggressive recovery actions from banks, despite recent improvements in asset quality.The auditing firm in its post 2026 budget presentation analysis says the sector’s ability to meet this target will be a defining test for Ghana’s financial stability.The caution comes as the NPL ratio has already fallen from 22.8% in 2024 to 20.4% by September 2025, helped by a stronger cedi, write-offs, recoveries and moderate credit growth.Under the central bank’s new NPL reduction guidelines, regulated financial institutions are expected to submit board-approved strategies detailing how they intend to manage and reduce bad loans over the period.Deloitte also highlights a sharp easing in credit conditions, with average lending rates dropping from 30.6% in 2024 to 22.7% in 2025, and expects further declines as macroeconomic conditions stabilize.On restructuring, Deloitte points to a major turnaround at the National Investment Bank following government’s interventions—GH¢450 million in cash, GH¢1.5 billion in marketable bonds, and the transfer of GH¢500 million in Nestlé Ghana shares.These measures have reversed NIB’s negative capital adequacy position to 23% and restored full compliance, paving the way for the bank to refocus on SMEs and expand its transaction capacity.The firm notes that government plans to recapitalize other state-owned banks could further strengthen the industry, stabilize depositor confidence, protect jobs and position the institutions for eventual listing on the Ghana Stock Exchange.Tags: DeloitteEconomyGhana NewsloansNPL",Emmanuel Oppong,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/banks-face-high-stakes-push-to-hit-10-npl-by-2026-deloitte/
Fitch projects policy rate drop to 16.5% by 2026,"Fitch Solutions is forecasting that the Bank of Ghana (BoG) will cut its monetary policy rate to 16.50% by the end of 2026, supported by continued currency stability and a steady decline in inflation.Speaking at the 2026 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Post-Budget Forum in Accra, Mike Kruiniger, Assistant Director at Fitch Solutions, noted that Ghana’s strengthening macroeconomic environment provides scope for further monetary easing in the coming year.He highlighted that the BoG has already initiated an aggressive easing cycle.“Rates have remained elevated, but the Bank of Ghana launched a decisive easing cycle this summer, cutting by 650 basis points so far — the fastest monetary easing cycle globally this year,” he said.Kruiniger added that with inflation now back within the central bank’s target band—supported by robust foreign exchange inflows and a relatively stable currency—Fitch expects the benchmark policy rate to be gradually reduced to 16.50% by the end of 2026.“While monetary transmission takes time, we anticipate a clear pickup in private-sector credit demand over the coming quarters, following nearly three years of weakness”, he noted.Meanwhile, Fitch Solutions has predicted robust economic growth for Ghana in 2026, projecting that the country will outperform many of its emerging-market peers. The UK-based research firm attributes this outlook to Ghana’s solid macroeconomic performance in 2025 and expects the momentum to extend into next year.“We see the 2026 budget as broadly supportive of growth, and this aligns with our forecast that Ghana’s real GDP growth will rise from an already strong 5.8% in 2025 to 5.9% in 2026. Continued strong economic performance will be driven by private consumption and an ongoing recovery in fixed investment, which is rebounding from the sharp contraction recorded in 2023″, Kruiniger added.However, Kruiniger cautioned that the escalating Islamist insurgency in the Sahel poses a significant risk to Ghana’s economic outlook heading into 2026. He explained that persistent instability in the region could lead to security spillovers with implications for Ghana’s investment climate, fiscal health, and broader macroeconomic stability.He further noted that Ghana may be compelled to increase military spending to safeguard the economy from potential shocks.Tags: Fitch Solutionspolicy rate",Daniel Oduro-Mensah,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/fitch-projects-policy-rate-drop-to-16-5-by-2026/
"EU to Ghana, Cote dIvoire: Accelerate cocoa reforms or risk market losses","Ghana and neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire are coming under renewed pressure from the European Union and its French development partners to accelerate long-delayed reforms in the cocoa sector, amid warnings that both countries risk losing competitiveness under emerging global sustainability rules.The call was issued at a two-day Cocoa4Future feedback workshop in Accra, where researchers presented extensive findings from the five-year EU and AFD-funded project examining agroforestry systems, disease control, certification schemes, farmer livelihoods and climate resilience across both countries.EU officials were unequivocal: unless agroforestry adoption accelerates, deforestation is curbed, and labour-related risks addressed, West African cocoa could face growing barriers under new European sustainability rules and tightening buyer requirements.Research findings presented at the workshop paint a complex picture of sector vulnerabilities—and clear pathways for reform. Multiple studies confirmed farmers’ strong preference for low to no-shade systems, which boost yields in the short term but reduce ecological resilience and long-term productivity.The researchers underscored that widespread use of such systems undermines forest recovery and leaves cocoa landscapes highly fragile in the face of climate change.On disease management, researchers warned that Cocoa Swollen Shoot Disease remains pervasive, slashing yields by up to 202 kg per hectare in severely affected farms, while farmer-led control methods—such as cutting infected portions or applying chemicals—are largely ineffective.The project recommends intensifying rehabilitation programmes, scaling the production of CSSVD-resistant seedlings, and expanding technical training for early detection.Certification studies revealed that while Fairtrade and Organic schemes significantly boost yields, incomes and job creation, their impact on broader food security and working conditions remains uneven.They further emphasised the need for cooperative strengthening, expanded extension services, access to affordable credit and more diversified buyer networks to enhance certification outcomes.Across all themes, researchers urged governments to ramp up input distribution, clarify tree tenure rights, promote hybrid cocoa varieties, incentivise agroforestry adoption, and formalise support systems for farmer livelihoods—from pensions to credit to modern farm equipment.Development partners say these evidence-based recommendations are now critical as the global market shifts decisively toward traceable, climate-resilient and ethically sourced cocoa—standards Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire risk falling behind if reforms stall.Tags: AccraCocoaCocoa4Future feedbackCote d""ivoireEUGhanaGhana Newsheadline",Emmanuel Oppong,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/eu-to-ghana-cote-divoire-accelerate-cocoa-reforms-or-risk-market-losses/
2026 budget needs stronger measures for transformation  CERPA,"The Centre for Economic Research and Policy Analysis (CERPA) has released its independent assessment of Ghana’s 2026 Budget, concluding that while the government has maintained macroeconomic stability, the budget falls short of outlining a bold and transformative path for long-term growth, job creation and competitiveness.In its review of the Budget Statement presented to Parliament on 13 November 2025, CERPA noted that the 2026 plan builds on gains recorded in 2025, including lower inflation, a more stable cedi and improved fiscal balances.However, the think tank stressed that significant gaps remain in revenue mobilisation, structural reforms and policies needed to drive productivity and economic diversification.CERPA highlighted that government expects total revenue and grants to reach GH¢268.1 billion in 2026, up by 18.3 percent from 2025, while expenditure is projected to rise by 12.2 percent to GH¢302.4 billion. The organisation cautioned that these revenue projections may be overly optimistic given Ghana’s history of shortfalls.On fiscal consolidation, the government’s target of achieving a primary surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP and an overall deficit of 2.2 percent aligns with national commitments. But CERPA warned that implementation risks remain high, particularly in managing rising interest costs and maintaining discipline in election-year spending.CERPA also assessed the 4.8 percent growth target for 2026, saying it will require stronger, targeted interventions in agriculture, industry and small and medium-sized enterprises. The think tank welcomed proposed debt management measures, including rebuilding the Sinking Fund and limiting non-concessional borrowing, but called for clearer timelines and enhanced transparency in reporting.The review acknowledged the government’s continued investment in social protection programmes such as Free SHS, NHIS, LEAP and School Feeding. Infrastructure initiatives under the Big Push Programme and the 24-Hour Economy are expected to support job creation if effectively implemented.CERPA praised the budget for reforms aimed at modernising revenue systems, improving monetary policy coordination and emphasising digital taxation. It also welcomed the continued commitment to fiscal responsibility under the revised Public Financial Management Act.However, the think tank flagged several weaknesses, including potential revenue overestimation, pressures from domestic borrowing that could crowd out private investment, limited productivity-focused reforms in agriculture and manufacturing, and fragmented poverty reduction strategies lacking clear impact measures.In its overall conclusion, CERPA stated that while the 2026 Budget keeps Ghana on a stabilisation path, it does not fully articulate a transformative agenda that addresses deep structural constraints. The organisation urged government to enhance implementation credibility, invest more in growth sectors, diversify exports and pursue reforms that support job creation and long-term resilience.Read alsoCERPA reviews 2026 Budget Statement and Economic PolicyTags: 2026 Budget24-hour economyBig Push ProgrammeCentre for Economic Research and Policy Analysis (CERPA)Free SHSLEAP and School FeedingNHISPublic Financial Management Act",Citi Newsroom,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/2026-budget-needs-stronger-measures-for-transformation-cerpa/
CERPA reviews 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy,"IntroductionThe 2026 Budget, presented to Parliament by the Minister for Finance on 13 November 2025, is the second budget of the NDC administration under the “Reset Agenda.” Themes of fiscal discipline, macroeconomic stability, and job creation dominated the budget, which is anchored on “Resetting for Growth, Jobs, and Economic Transformation.” This document presents a review of the budget statement delivered on behalf of the President. The review outlines (i) a snapshot of macroeconomic performance for 2025 and the target for 2026, (ii) the key highlights of the budget, (iii) its strengths and weaknesses, and (iv) our concluding opinions and the implications of the budget. Snapshot of Macroeconomic Performance GDP Growth (%)Indicator2024Q12025Q12024H1 (June)2025H1(June)2025Proj Q1-Q42026TargetOverall GDP4.95.35.16.34.84.8Non-oil GDP4.36.85.67.85.34.9Note: Q1= quarter one, H1= first half of the year, and Proj= projected Fiscal BalanceIndicator2025Target (revised)ProjQ1 – Q3OutturnQ1 – Q3ProjQ1 – Q4Target for 2026Total Revenue and Grants (billions of GH¢)229.9162.6154.9226.4268Total Expenditure (billions of GH¢)269.4206.9178.4251.7302.4Primary Balance (Commitment basis)1.5%0.6%1.6%1.8%1.5%Overall Fiscal Deficit (Commitment basis)-2.8%-3.2%-1.5%-1.8%-2.2%Note: Proj= projected  Price Development Cedi Performance (Inter-Bank Rate)Indicator 10th November 202410th November 2025US DollarGH¢16.35GH¢10.92British PoundGH¢21.09GH¢14.37EuroGH¢17.50GH¢12.62 Public Debt Development Key highlights of the budgetHere are some key or notable features of the 2026 Fiscal Budget:Revenue Target: The government aims to collect GH¢268.1 billion in total revenue and grants, representing an 18.3% increase from the 2025 amount of GH¢229.9 billion.Expenditure Target: The government plans to spend GH¢302.4 billion in 2026, representing a 12.2% increase over the 2025 allocation of GH¢269.4 billion.Fiscal Discipline: The budget prioritises fiscal discipline, targeting a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP and an overall deficit of 2.2% of GDP.Economic Growth: Ghana’s economy is projected to grow by 4.8% in 2026, supported by improved fiscal discipline and ambitious development priorities. This exceeds the 2025 growth target of 4.0%.Inflation: Inflation is expected to stay within the target band of 8% with a margin of error of ±2 percent.Tax Reforms: The budget introduces several tax reforms, including the abolition of the COVID-19 levy and decoupling of GETFund and NHIL levies from the VAT Tax base. It also abolishes VAT on mineral exploration and extends zero-rated VAT on local textiles to 2028.Public Debt Management: Key actions include rebuilding the Sinking Fund to create buffers for future repayments, conducting debt reprofiling and bond buy-backs to reduce high-cost obligations, limiting non-concessional borrowing to only strategic projects, and improving transparency through regular publication of debt operations.Social Protection: The budget prioritises social protection, with allocations for free SHS, NHIS, LEAP, and school feeding programmes.Infrastructure Development: The budget includes investments in infrastructure, including the Big Push Infrastructure Programme.Job Creation: The government aims to create over 800,000 jobs in 2026 through infrastructure projects, TVET expansion, and the 24-Hour Economy initiative. Observed Strengths and Weaknesses Based on the notable features of the 2026 Fiscal budget, here are some strengths and weaknesses of the budget: Strengths Revenue Mobilisation: The budget targets e-commerce, cross-border digital transactions which encapsulate a broad and modern source of revenue mobilisation. The budget also projects non-oil domestic revenue to increase to 15.7% of GDP in 2026 from 15.1% projected for 2025, through tighter enforcement and the digitalisation of tax administration.Government Expenditure: Government plans to increase spending by 12.2% in 2026, signaling an expansionary fiscal policy. This is expected to support the needed economic growth, provided the required revenues are mobilised to finance the higher expenditure.Fiscal Discipline: The budget prioritises fiscal discipline, targeting a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP and an overall deficit of 2.2% of GDP, an improvement from the 2.8% projected for 2025 and 7.9% outturn recorded at end-December 2024. This aligns with the amended Public Financial Management Act (2025) and the IMF-supported programme.Macroeconomic Stability: The budget aims to sustain macroeconomic stability, with single-digit inflation and exchange rate stability, preserving gains made in 2025. Debts: The government’s debt management approach which focuses on extending maturities, reducing borrowing costs, and strengthening credibility represents a positive shift in overall debt management.Social Protection: The budget maintains funding for social protection programs, including the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) program, National Health Insurance Scheme, and School Feeding Programme. WeaknessesRevenue Assumptions: The budget’s ambitious fiscal targets hinge on optimistic revenue projections that may prove difficult to achieve, particularly given Ghana’s persistent tax compliance challenges. Notably, the government missed its revenue target for Q1–Q3 by GH¢7.7 billion, underscoring the risks associated with these assumptions.Fiscal Gaps: The budget has underlying fiscal gaps, with rising interest obligations, and a balancing gap, requiring additional borrowing to finance interest costs and priority programmes. Crowding-out Effect: The budget poses a significant risk of crowding-out private sector activity, as increased domestic borrowing could constrain credit availability and raise lending costs. This may slow job creation, weaken industrial growth, and undermine broader economic transformation efforts. Job Creation: Although the projected creation of 800,000 jobs is commendable, concerns remain about their sustainability, as a significant share is linked to construction-related activities under the Big Push and other infrastructure programmes. Limited Transformational Vision: The budget falls short of articulating a clear transformational agenda, with minimal emphasis on productive investment. Its orientation remains largely toward fiscal consolidation rather than catalytic, growth-enhancing expansion. Poverty Reduction: The 2026 Budget does not present a clear poverty-reduction framework. Although the budget references various social protection initiatives, it does not provide a coherent matrix outlining how these policies and programmes will directly alleviate poverty among vulnerable groups. The document lacks measurable targets, timelines, and defined implementation pathways for reducing poverty, making it difficult to assess how proposed interventions will translate into meaningful improvements in the welfare of low-income households Conclusive Opinion and ImplicationsThe 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of Ghana presents a mixed picture, with both strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the budget prioritises fiscal discipline, targeting a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP and an overall deficit of 2.2% of GDP, aligning with the amended Public Financial Management Act and the IMF-supported programme.The budget also prioritises social protection and investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, with a focus on promoting economic growth and reducing inequality. The “Big Push Infrastructure Programme” and the “24-Hour Economy” initiative are notable examples of this.However, concerns have been raised about the potential crowding-out effect of domestic borrowing, which could slow job creation, weaken industrial growth, and undermine economic transformation efforts.The budget’s ambitious fiscal targets also hinge on optimistic revenue assumptions, which may be challenging to achieve given Ghana’s persistent tax compliance issues and limited diversification of the revenue base. This may worsen the projected fiscal gap, forcing the government to resort to debt financing.Overall, the 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of Ghana is a credible attempt to consolidate macroeconomic stability, accelerate job creation, and protect social progress; however, its success will depend on effective execution, realistic revenue strategies, and institutional accountability. Tags: 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policyand Economic TransformationArticleCERPAEconomic GrowthGhanaGhana NewsjobsPublic Debt ManagementResetting for GrowthRevenue target",Citi Newsroom,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/cerpa-reviews-2026-budget-statement-and-economic-policy/
"BoG flags global fragility, domestic pressures as 127th MPC meeting begins","The Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr. Johnson Asiama, has warned that the global economic environment remains uncertain, stressing the need for Ghana and other emerging markets to remain vigilant.He notes that despite Ghana’s improving economic outlook, significant global and domestic risks still demand careful policy attention.Speaking at the opening session of the Central Bank’s 127th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, Dr. Asiama noted that the global economic environment remains highly uncertain, citing persistent geopolitical tensions adding that these factors, he said, could easily spill over into emerging economies like Ghana.“The broader macro-framework also supports this trajectory. Money supply growth has moderated significantly, helping anchor inflation. Real rates remain high, creating room for a carefully calibrated easing cycle. And with inflation likely to settle between 4–6 percent by year-end before stabilising around the target band in 2026, Ghana is entering what could become a multi-year period of price stability. At the same time, the global environment remains fragile, and we must remain alert to risks, commodity price swings, geopolitical tensions, and tighter external financial conditions,” he said.On the home front, the Governor acknowledged that although business and consumer confidence is gradually improving, firms continue to struggle with high taxes, rising utility tariffs, and elevated credit costs—all of which weigh on growth and competitiveness.Dr. Asiama outlined three key priorities for the Committee’s deliberations: sustaining the pace of disinflation without disrupting growth, strengthening reforms in the foreign exchange market, and ensuring continued stability within the financial sector to support effective credit transmission.He emphasised that Ghana’s economic trajectory is now stabilising, with a stronger foundation for sustained expansion. However, he stressed that policymakers must work to safeguard this progress.“Our task is to protect the stability we have achieved while supporting recovery in the real sector,” Dr. Asiama said. “The decisions we take today must reinforce confidence, signal predictability, and keep the economy on its path toward higher, job-rich growth.”The MPC is expected to announce its policy rate decision at the end of the meeting. Tags: 127th MPC meetingAto ForsonBank of GhanaEconomyGhana NewsJohnson Asiama",Nerteley Nettey,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/bog-flags-global-fragility-domestic-pressures-as-127th-mpc-meeting-begins/
Eric Opoku: MoFA installs 20 automated weather stations nationwide,"The Ministry of Food and Agriculture has installed 20 automated weather stations across Ghana to strengthen the country’s agricultural meteorology and improve farming planning.Minister Eric Opoku made the announcement on Monday, November 24, during the Government Accountability Series.He explained that the stations, managed under the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet), operate 24/7 and automatically collect data, eliminating the need for manual readings.The move aims to enhance the accuracy and consistency of weather forecasts and agricultural planning.“The ministry has made significant strides in transforming Ghana’s agro-metrological landscape.

Importers and Exporters Association applauds govt as U.S. lifts 15% export tariffs,"The Importers & Exporters Association of Ghana (IEAG) has praised the Government of Ghana, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for successfully securing the rescission of the 15% export tariffs previously imposed by the United States on Ghanaian cocoa and other agricultural products.The tariffs, which affected cocoa, avocado, cashew nuts, mango, plantain, and other key exports, were lifted effective November 13, 2025.Samson Asaki Awingobit, Executive Secretary of IEAG, described the development as a major victory for Ghana’s exporters, noting that the tariffs had threatened profit margins, production levels, and jobs in the export sector.He emphasised that the reversal restores Ghana’s competitiveness in international markets and helps safeguard vital foreign exchange earnings.Mr. Awingobit also highlighted that trade diversification efforts, including the recent Ghana–China zero-tariff trade agreement, played a role in reducing pressure on U.S. demand and encouraging the rescission of the tariffs.While celebrating the success, IEAG urged the government to maintain momentum in trade diplomacy, strengthen the export ecosystem, and implement measures such as export credit guarantees and risk mitigation tools.The association also called for efforts to diversify Ghana’s export base to reduce reliance on traditional commodities like cocoa, gold, and oil, which accounted for over 83% of total exports in 2024.“This diplomatic achievement is a testament to persistent trade negotiations and strategic policymaking,” Mr. Awingobit said. “We remain committed to partnering with government to translate this opportunity into sustained export growth, value addition, and stronger foreign exchange inflows.”The IEAG encourages all stakeholders, public and private, to capitalize on this moment to strengthen Ghana’s export-driven economy.Tags: agricCocoaExecutive SecretaryGovernment of GhanaImporters & Exporters Association of Ghana (IEAG)Ministry of Foreign AffairsSamson Asaki AwingobitUS",Abigail Arthur,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/importers-and-exporters-association-applauds-govt-as-u-s-lifts-15-export-tariffs/

UMB CEO named Business Leader of the Decade,"Dr. Philip Oti-Mensah, Chief Executive Officer of Universal Merchant Bank (UMB), has been named a Top Influential Business Leader of the Decade at the 2025 Ghana Corporate Executives Awards.The event—organised by the Entrepreneurs Foundation of Ghana—was held at the Mövenpick Ambassador Hotel on Saturday, 22nd November 2025.This prestigious honour recognises extraordinary leaders whose strategic foresight, sustained impact, and transformational leadership have significantly shaped industries and strengthened Ghana’s economic trajectory over the past decade.For many industry observers, the recognition affirms Dr. Oti-Mensah’s long-standing record of turning around institutions, developing high-performing talent, and championing initiatives that support national economic advancement.A Decade of Institutional TransformationDr. Oti-Mensah’s impact on Ghana’s financial services sector spans leadership roles across several prominent institutions.A key milestone in his career was his leadership of Union Savings and Loans, where the shareholders and board entrusted him with transforming the organisation into a universal bank.Between 2013 and 2015, he moved the institution from the bottom of the industry to number one in total assets and profitability—an exceptional turnaround achieved in less than three years.Following this, he worked closely with the Bank of Ghana to secure a universal banking licence, establishing OmniBank as its founding Chief Executive Officer.He later played a pivotal role in the merger that created OmniBSIC, where, as Executive Director, he led key aspects of the bank’s recapitalisation and organisational restructuring, positioning it for long-term growth and stability.A Leader Who Builds People, Not Just OrganisationsThroughout the industry, Dr. Oti-Mensah is celebrated not only for transforming institutions but also for developing leaders. Today, nearly every major bank in Ghana has at least one senior professional who was directly trained or mentored under his leadership—an enduring legacy that continues to elevate the sector’s human capital.Accelerating Transformation at UMBSince assuming the role of CEO at Universal Merchant Bank, Dr. Oti-Mensah has championed an ambitious transformation agenda that is already producing strong, measurable results. Between May and October 2025, UMB’s total assets more than doubled—from approximately GHS 5 billion to over GHS 13 billion—and returned one of Ghana’s oldest indigenous banks to profitability within months. Analysts have described this performance as “unprecedented in recent banking cycles.”Under his stewardship, UMB has sharpened its strategic direction, expanded its digital banking footprint, strengthened customer experience, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced staff capabilities to meet modern banking demands. Industry experts now view UMB as firmly repositioned for sustained growth and renewed market competitiveness.A Recognition of Enduring InfluenceThe Top Influential Business Leader of the Decade honour at the Ghana Corporate Executives Awards celebrates leaders whose influence extends beyond their immediate organisations to shape the direction of entire industries. Dr. Oti-Mensah’s unique ability to drive institutional renewal, develop future leaders, and guide organisations toward resilience and long-term success places him among Ghana’s most impactful business figures of his generation.The 2025 Ghana Corporate Executives Awards, celebrating its 10th anniversary, was held under the theme: “The Role of Public–Private Partnerships in Corporate Governance and Economic Development.”Tags: 2025 Ghana Corporate Executives AwardsBank of GhanaDr. Philip Oti-MensahOmniBSICUnion Savings and LoansUniversal Merchant Bank (UMB)",Citi Newsroom,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/umb-ceo-named-business-leader-of-the-decade/
SEC warns public over rising TV money doubling scams,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cautioned the general public about the growing number of suspected fraudulent investment schemes—commonly referred to as “money doubling” schemes—being advertised on some television stations across the country.In a public notice, the SEC emphasised that these schemes promise unusually high returns with little or no risk, a characteristic typical of fraudulent operations designed to lure unsuspecting investors into handing over their money.According to the Commission, none of the schemes currently being advertised have been approved, authorised, or licensed by the SEC.It, therefore, urged the public to be vigilant and avoid investing in products or services offered by these unlicensed entities.The SEC further warned individuals and groups involved in promoting such schemes that their actions constitute a criminal offence under Section 144(1) of the Securities Industry Act, as amended, and Section 294(1)(b) of the Companies Act. These laws prohibit public invitations or advertisements on securities-related products without proper licensing or clearance from the SEC.The Commission encouraged the public to verify the licensing status of any investment firm or promoter by contacting its toll-free line, 0800100065, its main office numbers, 0302 768 970–2, or by emailing [email protected].The SEC also disclosed that several entities have already been identified for engaging in these deceptive advertisements, though details were not immediately released.The Commission reaffirmed its commitment to protecting investors and maintaining a fair, transparent, and efficient securities market.…..Explore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!Click on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:

Spare part prices drop in Abossey Okai; more cuts expected in 2026  Dealers,"The Abossey Okai Spare Parts Dealers Association has reported that prices of spare parts have started to decline and are expected to continue falling through the end of the year.This development follows recent engagements led by the Minister for Trade, Agribusiness and Industry, Elizabeth Ofosu-Adjare, with the leadership of the Ghana Union of Traders Association (GUTA), spare parts dealers, and transport operators.During these meetings, stakeholders were urged to address persistent price irregularities and the recent spikes recorded across major markets.Speaking to Citi News on Monday, November 24, the Association’s Head of Communications, Takyi Addo, said a meeting is scheduled this week with importers and retailers to negotiate further price reductions, which could extend into 2026.“Some prices have already been reduced, but more needs to be done. The reductions we expect are not yet fully visible. From now until the end of the year, more prices will drop, and in 2026, we anticipate a 9.9% reduction in our surplus industry,” Mr Addo explained.He added that the association is actively educating retailers and engaging with importers, noting that the majority of market players are retailers, while importers are relatively few.“We are now talking to importers because most of the people are retailers; the importers are very few,” he said.Tags: Abossey OkaiGhana NewsGUTASpare parts dealersTrade Ministry",Daniel Oduro-Mensah,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/spare-part-prices-drop-in-abossey-okai-more-cuts-expected-in-2026-dealers/
BoGs Monetary Policy Committee begins 127th meeting as market anticipates possible rate cut,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Ghana (BoG) begins its 127th meeting today, November 24, 2025, with discussions expected to centre on key macroeconomic developments shaping the country’s recovery trajectory.The meeting will review current economic conditions and signal the central bank’s policy direction for the final weeks of 2025.The Committee convenes at a time when the Ghana Cedi has experienced relative stability after a brief depreciation earlier in the year – an episode the central bank described as a market correction rather than a reversal in the currency’s overall trend.Despite this stability over the past few months, the Cedi has begun showing marginal depreciation, partly driven by heightened demand for dollars ahead of the Christmas trading season.Inflation has also continued its downward path. Consumer inflation fell to 8 percent in October, driven by sustained tight monetary policy, fiscal consolidation, and improved food supply conditions.The rate is now below the year-end target of 11.9 percent, strengthening calls for further monetary easing.Also, Ghana’s economic performance has shown notable improvements. Real GDP (including oil) expanded by 6.3% in the second quarter of 2025, up from 5.1% in 2024.Non-oil GDP grew by a stronger 7.8%, compared to 5.7% recorded in 2024, reflecting sustained activity in services, construction, and agriculture.In September, the MPC cut the benchmark policy rate by 350 basis points to 21.5%, citing a sustained decline in inflationary pressures.This followed another major cut in July, when the rate was reduced by 300 basis points from 28% to 25%, marking one of the most aggressive easing cycles in recent years.Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Johnson Asiama said the earlier cuts were aimed at stimulating credit growth and supporting economic recovery though he cautioned that risks remain elevated, especially with potential utility tariff adjustments and ongoing currency pressures.With inflation now at 8 percent and the real policy rate still significantly positive hovering about 10 percentage points above headline inflation, market analysts see room for more easing. Many expect the MPC to deliver another rate cut this month, supported by favourable base effects and improved inflation dynamics.Forecasts from some economists point to a potential 100 to 250 basis point reduction, provided fiscal discipline is maintained and external shocks—particularly from global commodity prices and forex market volatility remain in check.With the Cedi showing signs of weakening amid seasonal forex demand, markets will be closely watching how the MPC balances economic recovery with currency stability.The MPC’s deliberations will conclude with a press conference on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, where the central bank will announce its policy rate decision and provide its latest assessment of the economic outlook.Tags: Bank of GhanaMPCpolicy rate",Nerteley Nettey,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/bogs-monetary-policy-committee-begins-127th-meeting-as-market-anticipates-possible-rate-cut/
PwC urges caution as BoG eyes policy rate review,"Professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has advised the Bank of Ghana to tread carefully as it considers whether to adjust the monetary policy rate at its meeting scheduled from Monday, November 24 to Wednesday, November 26, 2025.PwC flagged lingering external risks, referencing UK-based Fitch Solutions, which has cautioned that although Ghana’s economic outlook remains robust, rising Islamist insurgency in the Sahel could threaten the country’s growth trajectory.Speaking to the media on the sidelines at the PwC 2026 Post-Budget Forum, PwC Ghana’s Country Senior Partner, Vish Ashiagbor, said the central bank must balance the sharp decline in inflation with these emerging vulnerabilities as it reviews the current 21.5% policy rate.“I wouldn’t be surprised if the rate is held,” he said. “Inflation has dropped significantly and is now within the Bank of Ghana’s target band of 8 percent plus or minus 2, so there’s room for a cut. But Fitch has reminded us that risks are still out there, so caution is key.”He added that although a rate cut would be positive, maintaining the rate is the more likely outcome.“A cut would be good, but with so many variables at play, I wouldn’t be surprised if the committee decides to maintain the rate.”The policy decision comes on the back of the Bank of Ghana’s recent monetary adjustments. On September 17, 2025, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) lowered the benchmark rate by 350 basis points to 21.5%, citing a steady decline in inflationary pressures. The reduction was approved by a majority of MPC members.That move marked the second significant cut in 2025 as the central bank sought to stimulate credit growth and support economic recovery amid concerns over currency stability and looming utility tariff hikes.Earlier in July 2025, the MPC reduced the rate by 300 basis points from 28% to 25%, following a marginal increase in March from 27% to 28%. The Committee maintained the 28% rate at its May meeting.Tags: Bank of GhanaBoGEconomyGhana Newspolicy ratePWC",Daniel Oduro-Mensah,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/pwc-urges-caution-as-bog-eyes-policy-rate-review/
