Obeng, 46, admitted the offence, explaining that he stole the animals part of the 21 cattle entrusted to his care- because his employer failed to pay an agreed GH700.00 salary.

"Driver accused of GH58,000 visa fraud claims late MP John Kumah received money","A forty-four-year-old driver who is accused of defrauding a Police officer and a teacher of GH58,000 has been remanded by the Achimota Court.
Benjamin Osei Sarpong is said to have collected GH30,000 from the officer and GH28,000 from the teacher under the pretext of securing them Canadian visas but failed.
Sarpong claimed he gave the money he collected from the complainants to the late John Kumah, former Member of Parliament for Ejisu Constituency.
Charged with two counts of defrauding by false pretences, Sarpong has pleaded not guilty.
Sarpong was remanded after prosecution led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Stephen Ahiale opposed bail on the grounds that Police had warned Sarpong to appear before the court on June 19, 2025 but he failed.
According to ASP Ahiale, following Sarpongs refusal to appear in court, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.
ASP Ahiale said it has taken the Police more than five months to get the accused person to appear before the court although he had alerted all parties to appear in court.
Sarpong told the court that he was unwell and travelled to Sefwi Yamfo where he had no reception to receive or make calls. He however admitted receiving a call from the case investigator over the matter.
He told the court that he only heard about the matter four days ago and he came to court with an amount of GH10,000 to be paid to the complainants.
Sarpong told the court that on June 19, 2025, he was in court, but the court did not sit.
The trial judge, after checking the records, noted that Sarpong was not in court on June 19, 2025, although the court sat that day and issued a bench warrant.
After listening to submissions of the prosecution and the accused explanation, the court remanded Sarpong into lawful custody to reappear on December 3, 2025.
DSP Ahiale narrating the facts of the case, said the complainants, name withheld, are siblings in Accra and Kumasi respectively, while Sarpong, reside at Odorkor, Accra.
Prosecution said in October 2023, the complainants discussed their intention of traveling to Canada for a visit with a friend.
The said friend later introduced Sarpong to the complainants as someone who could help them secure Canadian visas.
After several meetings, Sarpong convinced them that he could secure the visas for them at a cost.
Based on that representation, Sarpong collected GH30,000 and GH28,000 from the complainants respectively.
Sarpong after collecting the money, failed to honour his promise and began giving the complainant numerous excuses.
The complainants reported the matter to the Police and on April 22, 2024, Sarpong was arrested.
Prosecution said during investigations, Sarpong admitted the offence but stated that he gave the money he collected to the late former MP for Ejisu Constituency with the knowledge of his wife.
Sarpong however failed to lead the Police to the late MPs wife.",,Crime, 22 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Driver-accused-of-GH-58-000-visa-fraud-claims-late-MP-John-Kumah-received-money-2010518

Teacher on bail over recruitment scam,"A teacher, Samuel Ofosu Amartey, has been granted GH100,000 bail with two sureties by the Amasaman Circuit Court in Accra over an alleged recruitment scam.
The court, presided over by Akosua Anokyewaa Adjepong, ordered that the sureties be gainfully employed and earn not less than GH2,000 a month.
It also instructed Amartey to report every Tuesday to the police investigator handling the case. He has pleaded not guilty to defrauding by pretence and is to return to court on December 18.
Giving the facts of the case, Police Chief Inspector Frederick Awuah-Ansah said:
Eric Manteaw, the complainant, is a professional teacher and a resident of Asamankese. Amartey is also a professional teacher and resides in Jamestown.
He said that in January 2024, the accused approached the complainant with a promise to recruit prospective applicants into the Ghana Immigration Service and the Ghana National Fire Service.

According to an adomonline.com report of November 18, 2025, Biney and a group of accomplices reportedly stormed a mining site in an attempted robbery.
Police acted swiftly on a tip-off and succeeded in arresting the suspect, who is believed to be the ringleader of the operation.

Two Forestry Commission officers interdicted over auction of impounded lumber,"Despite raising a record GH623,000 for the Forestry Commission within a single month, two officers in the Ahafo Region have been interdicted, an action believed to be linked to concerns that their work may expose previously under-declared revenues.
Our sources reveal that upon the appointment of Elikem Kotoko as Deputy CEO of the Forestry Commission in charge of Operations, he uncovered significant irregularities and expressed strong dissatisfaction over how the state was losing revenue through illegal lumber trade.
This position, we gathered, did not sit well with certain invisible hands. Following an intelligence-led operation across the Ahafo and Bono enclaves, the Deputy CEO confiscated several consignments of illegal lumber.
These merchants operated without the requisite permits, depriving the state of revenue, an act allegedly enabled by individuals who benefit from this illicit trade.
After the vehicles were impounded, the Deputy CEO reportedly instructed the Ahafo Timber Industry Development Division TIDD office to initiate the necessary court processes to obtain authorisation to auction the seized lumber and deposit the proceeds into the Forestry Commissions bank account.
The TIDD team in Ahafo obtained the required court approval, auctioned the confiscated lumber, and deposited an impressive GH623,000 into the Commissions account.
This amount is more than 150 percent of the previous months deposits by operations of the National Monitoring Team.
This raised serious questions about whether the National Monitoring Team was failing to impound illegal lumber or underdeclaring the revenue generated.
Unexpectedly, individuals said to be benefiting from the underdeclared auctions mounted strong resistance, as the Deputy CEOs directives threatened their illicit operations.
Although reports show that the interdicted officers, Felix Gatiba and Eric Boamah, acted strictly on the instructions of the Deputy CEO, reports indicate that the HR Director issued interdiction letters to the officers, claiming he was acting on directives from the Chief Executive, Dr Hugh Brown and the Executive Director of TIDD, Dr Richard Gyimah.
A six-member committee was immediately constituted to investigate the matter.
While these officers successfully discharged their duties and generated significant revenue for the Commission and the state, their interdiction raises serious questions.
As part of the sanctions, they will forfeit 50 percent of their salaries during the investigation.
Some insiders within the Commission doubt whether the committee will thoroughly review all aspects of the operation, including the seizure of the lumber, the auction procedures, and the payment of the GH623,000.
This development underscores the critical need for a forensic audit within the Forestry Commission to unravel these invisible hands. It also raises concerns about how staff who diligently perform their duties are treated.
The outcome of the investigation will be crucial in determining whether due process was followed and why officers who generated substantial revenue for the state are facing disciplinary action.", Emmanuel Osei Kwadwo,Crime, 18 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Two-Forestry-Commission-officers-interdicted-over-auction-of-impounded-lumber-2010002

Nurse granted GH100k bail for defrauding colleague,"A 35-year-old nurse has been granted GH100,000.00 bail with two sureties by the Asante Akropong District Court in the Atwima Nwabiagya North District for defrauding her colleague at Tafo in Kumasi.
Esther Asamoah Dufie pleaded not guilty to the charge of defrauding by false pretence and will reappear before the court, presided over by Emmanuel Wiafe Adu, on November 27, 2025.
Police Detective Inspector Alexander Agbekpornu, presenting the facts of the case to the court, said the complainant, Ruth Afia Antwiwaa, and Dufie were colleagues in the same health facility and resided at Tafo and Ohwimase respectively.
He said that in January 2025, Dufie advertised a travelling opportunity for people who were interested in travelling to the United Kingdom (UK) on her WhatsApp status, and the complainant saw it and showed interest.
The complainant therefore contacted the accused person, and she told her that the slot was from her brother, who is a military officer in the United Kingdom.
According to the prosecution, the complainant also informed her friends husband about the travelling opportunity, and he also showed interest. They paid an amount of GH54,090.00 into a CalBank account number that the accused person provided.
After the payment, the accused person promised to bring the dependent from the UK in April 2025 for the visa process but failed, so the complainant demanded a refund of the money.
The prosecution explained that all efforts to retrieve the money proved futile, so on September 16, 2025, the complainant reported the matter to the Abuakwa Police, and Dufie was arrested.
In her caution statement, Dufie admitted and pleaded for time to refund the money by October 10, 2025, and was granted police enquiry bail, but she jumped bail and went into hiding until October 27, when she was rearrested at Tafo.
After further investigations, she was charged and brought before the court.",,Crime, 17 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Nurse-granted-GH-100k-bail-for-defrauding-colleague-2009882

The accused, Millicent Asamoah Ampofo, is facing a charge of unlawful control of a narcotic drug.
The court heard that during an intelligence-led operation on November 5, 2025, personnel from the Criminal Investigations Department arrested Millicent at her drinking spot at Taifa.
A search of the premises led to the retrieval of 47 plastic bottles of sobolo, 20 bottles of mango drink, 23 bottles of unidentified liquid substances, and a blue mini drum containing liquid substances.
Also found were two plastic containers of dried plant material, two rubber bags containing powdery substances and 180 pieces of hard brown toffees.
All items are suspected to contain cannabis.
The prosecution said Millicent admitted ownership of the items during her caution statement and mentioned a supplier identified only as Richard, based in Accra.
She said she prepared and sold the drinks and toffees, pricing the sobolo at GH5.00 per bottle, the mango drink at GH20.00, and the toffees at GH5.00 each.
Her plea was not taken because the suspected substances have been forwarded to the Police Forensic Science Laboratory for examination.

Refuse collector jailed 10 years for attempting to rob US diplomat with a toy gun,"A refuse collector who attempted to rob a diplomat of his iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 8 mobile phones at Cantonments has been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment by an Accra Circuit Court.
The convict, Joshua Aminu, was charged with two counts of attempt to commit robbery. He pleaded guilty to the offences.
Aminu committed the offence with a toy gun on September 26, 2025.
He pleaded for leniency, but the court, presided over by Jojo Hagan, convicted him on his own plea and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment on each count.
The sentences are to run concurrently.
The court noted that although Aminu did not waste the courts time by pleading guilty, the sentence was necessary considering the prevalence of robbery in the country.
He has 30 days to appeal the sentence.
The prosecution said the complainant was a scientist and diplomat with the United States Embassy, residing at Cantonments in Accra, while the convict lived around the Konkomba Market area.
On September 26, between 5:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., the complainant, Mr. John Kiona, was taking a walk around the American Embassy enclave when Aminu confronted him and demanded that he handed over his valuables.

Ransford Owusu Ansah's Death: Facts emerging about coach Ibrahim Anyass,"Until recently, Ibrahim Anyass was known simply as a youth football coach helping young boys chase their dreams at the Siano Football Academy in Amasaman, Accra.
Today, he stands accused of shattering those very dreams, allegedly preying on one of his players, 16-year-old Ransford Owusu Ansah, whose death in March 2025 sparked nationwide outrage.
Very little is publicly known about Anyass, the man at the centre of one of Ghanas most disturbing football scandals. Anyass, believed to be in his late thirties, is the head coach of Siano Football Academy.
This small community-based setup drew dozens of young boys with dreams of becoming professional footballers.
10 Ghanaian-born players who have switched to play for other countries
For many parents, Siano was seen as a chance to give their children a future through football.
But behind the hopeful smiles and training sessions, disturbing allegations have emerged that Anyass sexually abused some of the boys under his care, including 16-year-old Ransford Owusu Ansah, who tragically died in March 2025 after reportedly enduring years of abuse.
While Anyass kept a relatively low public profile, a few videos circulating online show him in casual moments with the children, sometimes in rooms where they appear to be asleep, or on the training grounds where he led practice drills.
These clips, once harmless to viewers, have now taken on a chilling new context as investigators and the public question what really went on behind closed doors at the academy.
Anyass has yet to publicly respond to the allegations. The closest he came was during a reported phone call on a television programme, where he promised to share his side of the story, a promise he never fulfilled.
He has, however, been summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to respond to the accusations following widespread outrage and a growing online campaign under the hashtag #JusticeForRansford.

November 20 set for hearing in malicious prosecution case against police officers,"A motion on notice has been filed to set down for hearing the case involving two
Ghana Police Service
officers accused of malicious prosecution by the leader of the Alliance for the Restoration of Civil Rights (ARCR), William Kofi Yirenkyi.
The case has been scheduled for hearing on November 20, 2025, at the Accra High Court (General Jurisdiction).
In a Facebook post dated November 5, 2025, Yirenkyi disclosed that the
Ghana Police Service
had failed to file a defence or enter an appearance in the civil suit, nearly three months after being served.
Describing the silence as a disregard for due process, he said he had instructed his lawyers to proceed by filing a motion on notice to set the case down for hearing.
He cited the Supreme Court decision in In Re Nungua Chieftaincy Affairs, Nii Odai Ayiku IV v. Attorney-General and Wor-Nii Bortei Bortelabi [2010] SCGLR 413, which allows for such motions when defendants fail to respond within the required time frame.
The landmark malicious prosecution suit was originally filed on May 26, 2025, at the High Court of Justice in Accra.
The defendants, Detective Corporal (D/C) Inspector Mathias Awudi and D/C Inspector Richard Ackumey, both attached to the Accra Regional Police Command, are accused of wrongful arrest, unlawful detention and initiating a baseless prosecution against Yirenkyi.
According to court documents, the dispute stems from December 30, 2023, when Yirenkyi reported an assault case at the Cantonments Police Station.
Dissatisfied with the pace of investigations, he escalated the matter to the Greater Accra Regional Police Commander in January 2024, leading to its reassignment to D/C Inspector Awudi.
However, after nearly eleven months of what Yirenkyi described as no tangible progress, tensions escalated on November 13, 2024, when he inquired about the case status.
He alleges that Awudi reacted angrily and had him arrested and detained for three days without cause.
William Yirenkyi drags two police officers to court over alleged malicious prosecution
Two days later, on November 15, 2024, he was arraigned before the Gbese District Court on charges of disturbing the peace in a public place under Section 298 of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29).
The prosecution, led by D/C Inspector Ackumey, reportedly failed to provide credible evidence, leading to Yirenkyis discharge by the court for lack of reasonable and probable cause.
Yirenkyi contends that the officers actions were driven by personal vendetta and intended to retaliate against his persistence in seeking justice.
He is seeking, A declaration of malicious prosecution, Special damages totaling GH40,000, covering legal fees (GH20,000) and lost income during detention, General damages, Costs and any further relief deemed appropriate by the court.
The writ of summons was issued by his lawyer, Martin L. Kpebu of Black Star Legal Services and served on the defendants with a directive to respond within eight days or risk judgment by default at the time.
The case will be heard on November 20, 2025, at the Accra High Court (General Jurisdiction).

2024 Kasoa Shooting: Ive been vindicated by Interior Ministers report  Hawa Koomson,"Former Member of Parliament for Awutu Senya East,
Mavis Hawa Koomson
, says she feels vindicated by the report of the Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed Mubarak, on the 2024 Kasoa shooting incident, which attributed the violence to security lapses and institutional failures rather than any individuals actions.
In a statement on Thursday, November 6, 2025, Hawa Koomson said the findings confirm what she had always maintained  that she was wrongly accused and unfairly targeted by the public and sections of the media.
The Ministers report confirms that 21 suspects have been identified, that there were clear breaches of discipline by some security officers, and that the use of firearms in certain situations was unjustified, she stated.
These findings affirm what I have consistently maintained, that the Kasoa incident was the result of security lapses and institutional failures, not the actions or instigation of any individual.
She lamented the years of vilification and what she described as harsh and unfair public attacks that branded her violent and unfit for office.
For years, I endured harsh and unfair public attacks. I was branded violent, reckless, and unfit for office through sensational and misleading headlines. The judgment was swift and painful. Today, the Interior Ministers findings have vindicated me, she said.
The former minister also recalled being assaulted during the rerun of polling stations in Ablekuma North, an incident she described as one of the darkest moments of her public life.
Hawa Koomson expressed sympathy for victims of electoral violence and endorsed the Interior Ministers recommendations for reforms in election security management.
She appealed to the public and political actors to avoid misinformation and divisive rhetoric, calling instead for unity and reflection.
Let us avoid misinformation, incitement, and divisive rhetoric. This moment calls not for blame, but for introspection, justice and national unity, she urged.",,Crime,  7 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/2024-Kasoa-Shooting-I-ve-been-vindicated-by-Interior-Minister-s-report-Hawa-Koomson-2008437

Fetish priest jailed 15 years for defiling and impregnating minor,"Correspondence from the Eastern Region
The Odumase-Krobo Circuit Court in the Eastern Region has sentenced a 26-year-old fetish priest, Ebenezer Asumah, to 15 years imprisonment with hard labour for defiling a 15-year-old girl at Osuwem, a community near Asutuare in the Shai-Osudoku District of the Greater Accra Region.
The Court found Asumah guilty of defilement contrary to section 101 (2) of the Criminal Offences Act 1960 (Act 29).
The Facts of the Case
Prosecuting, Chief Inspector John Kwesi Brahene disclosed that the complainant, Animo Mavis, a 27-year-old seamstress residing at Sawer-Sum near Somanya, is the elder sister of the victim.
The 15-year-old victim lived with their grandmother, Florence Ladjer, at Osuwern, where the accused also resided.
On August 5, 2025, in the evening, the accused approached the victim's grandmother and convinced her to allow the girl to accompany him to his house to assist with cooking, claiming he had injured his right hand. Out of sympathy, the grandmother obliged his request and allowed the girl to go with him.
The victim later prepared banku, pepper, and fish for the accused. After eating, Asumah locked the girl inside his room and forcibly had sexual intercourse with her.
The court heard that the act was repeated on three occasions.
Some weeks later, the victim began to feel unwell, prompting her sister to take her to the Somanya District Hospital on October 22, 2025, where she was diagnosed as pregnant.
Upon questioning, the girl identified the accused as the one responsible.
A complaint was subsequently lodged with DOVVSU Akuse, where police obtained statements from both the complainant and the victim.
A medical report form issued to the complainant was sent to the Akuse Government Hospital, where it was confirmed that the victim was 11 weeks pregnant.
The accused was arrested on October 23, 2025, and during interrogation, admitted to having sexual intercourse with the minor but claimed it was consensual.
After investigations, he was charged and arraigned before the Eastern Circuit Court at Odumase-Krobo.
Judgment
The presiding judge, His Honor Akwesi Appietse Abaidoo found the accused guilty and sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment with hard labour, stressing that the punishment should serve as a deterrent to others who take advantage of minors.",,Crime,  5 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Fetish-priest-jailed-15-years-for-defiling-and-impregnating-minor-2008226
Legal Aid lawyer to represent 51 foreigners in immigration case,"A Legal Aid Commission lawyer has agreed to represent 51 out of over 100 foreign nationals arraigned for alleged illegal entry and failure to acquire residence or work permits in Ghana.
Okyere Kumah, the assigned lawyer, introduced himself to the accused persons through an interpreter on Monday.
Initially, they rejected him, requesting proof of his legal status.
Kumah told the court that although the accused persons had refused to accept him, he had to announce his representation for the record.
For the sake of records, I had to announce myself and be recorded by the Court, he said.
However, Moussa Sylla, one of the accused, later explained that their hesitation stemmed from fear, as several individuals had previously claimed to be lawyers.
We did not have anything against him, just that we were scared... but we now trust him to represent us, he said.
Following this, Kumah applied for bail, but the Accra Circuit Court 11 declined, stating the request was premature.
The court ordered that the accused be remanded into prison custody, not police custody, citing the Prisons Services capacity to accommodate them.
The development occurred after the prosecution substituted its original charge sheet filed on October 21 with an amended version on November 3, 2025.
All 51 accused persons pleaded not guilty to charges of illegal entry and failure to obtain the necessary permits.
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Issah Archibari told the court that on October 7, 2025, police received intelligence about over 100 foreign nationals residing at Kuntunse-Satellite near Amasaman.
Upon arrival, the accused refused to disclose their identities and were arrested.
Investigations revealed they were from neighbouring francophone countries and had entered Ghana illegally between February and September 2025, working as Q-Net marketers without documentation.
ASP Archibari said they posed a flight risk and lacked permanent addresses.
Mr Kumah, however, argued that his clients had fixed residences and would appear for trial.",,Crime,  5 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Legal-Aid-lawyer-to-represent-51-foreigners-in-immigration-case-2008116

He criticised both the police and community leaders for failing to protect the victim, saying, No matter how poor you are, it is better to have your children closer to you and cater for them. Only a few children who grow up with guardians excel in life.

"22-year-old woman jailed six months for stealing provisions worth GH1,384","A 22-year-old unemployed woman, Comfort Antwiwaa, has been sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour by the Akim Oda District Court in the Birim Central Municipality for stealing provisions worth GH1,384 from Frimpong Enterprise, a popular supermarket in Oda.
Comfort pleaded guilty to the charge of stealing and was convicted on her own plea by Her Worship Adelaid Owusu-Asante, who presided over the case.
Presenting the facts, the prosecutor, Chief Inspector George Oteng-Appau, told the court that the incident occurred on October 27, 2025, at the Nkwantanum branch of Frimpong Enterprise.
The convict reportedly entered the shop under the guise of making purchases but later stole several items, including Peak milk, biscuits, Gino tomato paste, soap, sugar, washing powder, baby diapers, Annapurna salt and spaghetti.
According to the prosecution, Comfort initially made a small purchase and collected a receipt.
However, she returned shortly after and secretly packed additional goods into polythene bags without paying.
She then carried the stolen items to the Akim Ayirebi lorry station, intending to transport them out of town.
A vigilant shop attendant, who became suspicious of Comforts behaviour, confronted her and demanded proof of payment.
When she failed to produce a receipt for the extra items, she was apprehended and handed over to the police along with the stolen goods.
Investigations later revealed that Comfort had previously committed a similar theft at another branch of Frimpong Enterprise at Maderina about three months earlier.
In delivering judgment, the court noted that theft from local businesses was becoming rampant and that a custodial sentence was necessary to serve as a deterrent to others.

The deceased were identified as an adult male and two children, one about 14 years old and the other, about five, who was the son of the radio station manager.
Salam added that the assailants, believed to be from a rival community, were two men on foot.

Woodfields Company accuses police officer of landguardism,"Woodfields Development Company, a prominent real estate firm in Accra, has petitioned the Greater Accra Regional Police Commander, accusing a police officer, Corporal Richard Tetteh, of gross misconduct, landguardism, unlawful detention of its workers, and abuse of police authority.
The letter was copied to the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the Director of the PPSB, and the Attorney General for further action.
In a strongly worded petition filed by the companys solicitors, the firm alleged that embattled Richard Tetteh, together with a group of men, unlawfully entered its property at Chrematinville, a section of its vast land holdings at Nmai Djor-Borteyman, early on Sunday, October 25, 2025, to supervise the construction of a fence wall on the companys legally acquired land without authorization.
According to the petition, the police officer allegedly assaulted one of the companys security guards, used state-issued handcuffs as a weapon, and later ordered the arrest and detention of two of the companys employees Benjamin Takyi and Alex Gyebi without lawful cause.
Our clients own over 200 acres of land acquired from the Nungua Stool and validated by a Deed of Assignment valued at $20.5 million, with an approved residential layout from the Adenta Municipal Assembly, the letter stated.
The said Corporal Richard Tetteh, acting as a landguard, unlawfully entered the property, assaulted our security men, and caused their detention at the Regional Police cells.
The company further alleged that the police officers conduct violated several provisions of the 1992 Constitution and the Criminal Offences Act, including sections on unlawful entry, assault, and arbitrary arrest.
It also cited breaches of the Police Service Regulations, C.I. 76, which prohibit the misuse of authority for private purposes and conduct that brings the service into disrepute.
The company also claims that Inspector Richard Tetteh provides security for the landguards to construct the fence wall on the land at Nmai Djor-Borteyman belonging to Woodfields Cevelopment Company.
Corporal Richard Tetteh was reported to have been aiding Mr Jonathan Yohonu, popularly known as Big Joe to grab the land legally acquired by the company.
Mr Jonathan Yehuno, who hails from Nungua and elder brother of the current  Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mr Christian Tetteh Yohonu, claimed to have a connection in the higher police hierarchy.
Woodfields Development is therefore requesting the Greater Accra Regional Commander to order the immediate release of its detained workers, institute a full-scale investigation into the matter, and refer the case to the Police Professional Standards Bureau (PPSB).
The petition also called for disciplinary action against Richard Tetteh, including his dismissal or transfer from the Greater Accra Regional Command, stating that his actions have undermined public confidence in the Ghana Police Service.
Our client believes that the involvement of some police officers and soldiers in aiding civilians to encroach on their lands has escalated landguard activities in the area, the lawyers added.", Prosper Agbenyegah,Crime, 27 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Woodfields-Company-accuses-police-officer-of-landguardism-2006931

ASP Berko emphasised that the illegal mining activities of the suspects had caused severe environmental degradation, including the destruction of farmlands and the contamination of rivers, which served as major sources of drinking water for surrounding communities.
Prince Manu Morris, District Chief Executive (DCE) for Amansie West and Chairman of the District Security Council, commended the swift response by the security agencies and reaffirmed the Assemblys firm stance against illegal mining activities in the district.
He emphasised that the DISEC, in collaboration with the Ghana Police Service, the National Intelligence Bureau, and the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS), would continue to intensify surveillance and enforcement operations to ensure that all illegal foreign miners were flushed out.
We cannot allow the destruction of our environment and water bodies to continue. The government is committed to protecting our natural resources and ensuring that mining activities are done responsibly and legally.
Any individual or group, whether local or foreign, who engages in such destructive practices will face the full rigours of the law, Morris stated.
He further appealed to the residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious mining activities or movements of foreigners in their communities to the appropriate authorities for prompt action.
The arrested Burkinabes are currently in police custody assisting with investigations, while arrangements are being made to hand them over to the GIS for further processing and possible repatriation.",,Crime, 25 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Galamsey-Amansie-West-DISEC-arrests-21-Burkinabe-nationals-2006584
Obuasi Police arrest 32-year-old suspect in Kwabenakwa gun attack incident,"The Obuasi Police Command has arrested a 32-year-old man, identified as Joseph Antwi, also known as Kofi Koo, in connection with a recent shooting incident at Kwabenakwa, which left six people with varying degrees of injuries.
According to police reports, the suspect was apprehended at the Kwabenakwa Police barrier on October 17, 2025, by officers on duty, while he was attempting to flee the area following the incident.
His arrest came shortly after the Obuasi Magistrate court had issued a warrant for his arrest earlier that same day.
The Ashanti South Regional Police Commander, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Joseph Hammond Nyaaba, had earlier directed officers to intensify their search and ensure the suspect was brought to justice.
Acting swiftly on intelligence, the police succeeded in intercepting and arresting him at the barrier before he could escape.
The shooting incident, which occurred on October 14, 2025, reportedly took place at the Kwabenakwa lorry station, where the suspect allegedly opened fire, injuring six individuals in the process.
The victims, who sustained various gunshot wounds, were identified as Karatina Boateng, 20 years, and her one-year-old baby boy, Ibrahim Rean; Samuel Agyaben, 37; Maxwell Nyarko, 20; Achiaa Mensah, 28; and Mallam, 24.
They were immediately rushed to different health facilities within the Obuasi Municipality for emergency treatment.
While most of the victims were treated and discharged on the same day, Karatina Boateng and her baby were referred to the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi for further medical care due to the severity of their injuries.
Following his arrest, Joseph Antwi was arraigned before the Obuasi Magistrate court on Tuesday, October 21, 2025, where he was charged with causing harm, contrary to Section 69 of the Criminal and Other Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29).
The court subsequently remanded him into prison custody to reappear on November 04, 2025.
The police have assured the public that investigations were ongoing to uncover further details surrounding the incident, including the motive behind the attack and whether the suspect acted alone or with accomplices.
ACP Joseph Hammond Nyaaba, the Ashanti South Regional Commander, has commended the swift response of the officers involved in the arrest, emphasizing that the Ghana Police Service remained committed to ensuring the safety and security of all residents within the Obuasi Municipality and its environs.
He also urged the public to continue cooperating with the police by providing timely information that could aid in crime prevention and swift apprehension of offenders.",,Crime, 25 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Obuasi-Police-arrest-32-year-old-suspect-in-Kwabenakwa-gun-attack-incident-2006583
Drama in Court as lawyers of Adu-Boahene stage walkout,"Drama unfolded in the High Court in Accra on Thursday afternoon October 23, 2025, when lawyers for the former Director-General of the National Signals Bureau, Kwabena Adu-Boahene, led by Samuel Atta Akyea, staged a walked out during Court proceedings.
This was after the court, presided over by Justice John Eugen Nyante Nyadu, had declined their request to adjourn proceedings to abide by a motion filed at the Supreme Court on October 22 to prohibit the trial judge on grounds of alleged bias.
Moments after the court had held that the proceedings of the day would proceed with the 2nd prosecution witness mounting the witness box, Samuel Atta Akyea sought leave to leave.
The court did not grant his request to leave and insisted that proceedings continue with the witness testifying.
The defense lawyers said they had other engagements and left the courtroom while the 2nd witness proceeded to sit in the witness box.
Let the records reflect that counsel for the accused/applicants have abandoned the proceedings of the High Court consequent to the ruling of this court, the judge stated.
Samuel Atta Akyea, lead Counsel for the Accused persons had told the court that Yesterday, (Wednesday, October 22), we filed a process at the Supreme Court by way of an application for prohibition (of the judge).
In the circumstances, he prayed for the proceedings on Thursday, October 23, to be adjourned to abide by the outcome of the Supreme Court case.
State prosecutors led by Esi Dentaa Yankah, a Principal State Attorney, kicked against the prayer and said the mere filing of that application did not automatically warrant an adjournment.
Copious arguments were made forth and back by all parties, with each buttressing their position with authorities.
Ruling on the application, the court said: On the application for adjournment of proceedings consequent to the pendency of an application for a motion prohibiting me from further hearing the case, counsel for the accused persons has drawn my attention to the Supreme Court decision .... wherein the Supreme Court, in trying to establish bias of the judge in the issue of that case, among other cases, stated that the said application for oral application for an adjournment to abide by the outcome of the motion for prohibition.
I have also chanced upon a similar decision by the Supreme Court titled the Republic vs. Fast Track High Court, Accra; Ex parte Garri Daniel, reported in 2003/4 SCGLR... where the same Supreme Court has categorically stated that the pendency of an application for prohibition against the trial court does not automatically operate to stay proceedings in the court whose proceedings are being challenged.
Considering the fact that this earlier decision of the Supreme Court was not distinguished in the Exportec Kennedy Agyapong case, there appear to be two conflicting Supreme Court decisions on what the position is when a motion for prohibition is filed or brought against the trial court.
Counsel for the applicants/accused persons prayed for an adjournment and not a stay of proceedings. The bit of stay of proceedings was introduced by the decision in the Kennedy Agyepong case to buttress his submission.
It is to be noted that adjournments, by a plethora of authorities, are at the sole discretion of the trial court. In the instant case, no miscarriage of justice would be occasioned to the accused persons/applicants if proceedings continue today (Thursday) for the reason that, first, no finding has yet been made by the Supreme Court on the pending motion.
Secondly, should the applicants be successful with their pending application and the Supreme Court makes an observation of any impropriety on the part of this court, consequential orders will accordingly be made by the Supreme Court to correct all wrongs, and no miscarriage of justice would be occasioned.
Accordingly, the oral application for an adjournment is hereby refused, and I order the witness to mount the witness box for continuation, the Court ruled.
The case consequently has been adjourned to October 30, 2025 for continuation.",,Crime, 24 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Drama-in-Court-as-lawyers-of-Adu-Boahene-stage-walkout-2006467
