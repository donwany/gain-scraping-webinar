"Road crashes aren't linked with wizardry, but driver errors - DVLA manager","The Bono Regional Manager of the Driver Vehicle and Licensing Authority (DVLA), George Okyere, says it is unproven that road crashes that happen during the Christmas and other festive seasons are linked to wizardry.
He emphasised that human error of driver negligence and carelessness had been identified as some of the major causes of the road crashes in the yuletide season and called on especially commercial drivers to always remain patient and avoid mad rushing for passengers.
Speaking in an interview with the media at Abesim, near Sunyani, Okyere advised drivers to always check their tyres, brakes, and lighting systems, as well as do regular maintenance of their
vehicles.
He emphasised that road safety remained a collective responsibility and urged everybody to contribute towards ensuring a crash-free Christmas, calling on drivers to reduce speeding and avoid wrongful overtaking.
Okyere also urged drivers to observe road signs strictly, and called on commuters to always wear their seat belts, asking pedestrians and motorists to be extra cautious when using the road in the season.",,Regional,  8 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Road-crashes-aren-t-linked-with-wizardry-but-driver-errors-DVLA-manager-2012787
Galamsey Fight: NAIMOS set to deploy fifty officers to Western Region,"The National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) is set to deploy the first batch of 50 officers to help intensify the fight against illegal mining (galamsey) activities in the Western Region.
They would be stationed across three areas, namely, Ahanta West, and Wassa Amenfi East municipalities, and Ellembelle District, and would also supervise the operations of the other assemblies.
Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col) Joshua Satekla, Deputy Director of Operations at NAIMOS, said this during a stakeholders engagement with Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) and two Regional Police Commanders in the Western Region, at Sekondi.
The meeting was to brief participants on the Secretariats role in combating the galamsey and seek the support from the MMDCEs for the first set of officers scheduled for deployment to the region.
Lt Col Satekla stated that the mandate given to the NAIMOS by the government was vital in ensuring that water bodies and forest reserves were protected from destruction by galamsey, adding that they could only achieve that with the support of all stakeholders.
He said: We are not in to stop mining, but we are there to stop illegal mining and people mining some key priority areas, so there is a need for us to work together to ensure a sustainable environment for all.
He, however, mentioned interference from politicians, chiefs, and
other influential individuals as a major obstacle in the fight against illegal mining.
Lt Col Satekla said inadequate logistics was a problem hindering them from effectively delivering on their mandates.
Our two key challenges are interference from influential people, and we have that from the politicians, chiefs, and other key stakeholders in the various areas where we have worked.
And the other one is logistics, which are big problems that we need
to discuss, he stated.
Lt Col Satekla, therefore, called for the full support of the local assemblies, stressing that a collective effort was essential in combating illegal mining in the country.
The MMDCEs took turns to express their support and work with the NAIMOS to help fight the galamsey menace in their respective areas.",,Regional,  8 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Galamsey-Fight-NAIMOS-set-to-deploy-fifty-officers-to-Western-Region-2012786

Over 200 Dormaa farmers set to thrive under Nkokonkenkete initiative,"Joseph Addae Akwaboa, the Bono Regional Minister, has said that Dormaa Central, Dormaa East, and Dormaa West districts have been selected in the region to pilot the Nkokonketenkete project aimed at strengthening and increasing poultry production and reducing imports.
According to the minister, the government Under the project will supply farmers with four-week-old birds to raise and sell.
The Minister made this known during this year's National Farmers Day held in the Region at Amasu in the Dormaa Municipality. Over 200 farmers, he said, will be supported annually in every constituency.
He added that Veterinary and animal health services were being enhanced, reducing disease outbreaks through improved surveillance and vaccination coverage.
He assured that the region takes pride in Dormaa Ahenkro being a poultry hub, and continues to lead in livestock production, and as a driver of the local economic development.
In the Agriculture sector, the Minister said the region was making great strides and would continue to lead in agricultural development.
Per available statistics, we remain one of the top producers of maize,
cashew, plantain, eggs, and poultry in the country. Under the 2025 district agricultural performance review, Bono Region achieved a 12% increase in maize yields and 9% growth in rice production due to improved seed distribution and extension services, he said.
He noted that the youth in the region were responding positively to the call for youth in agriculture.
In an effort to promote youth in agriculture, the Minister said the Mahama-led government has reintroduced School Farms at all levels of education.
The purpose is to inculcate the passion of farming in the youth and change their misconception about the ecosystem of agriculture.
In this regard, a total number of 42 educational Institutions across the region have been involved, including 2 Colleges of Education, 21 Senior High Schools, 3 Vocational/Technical Schools, 8 Junior High Schools, and 7 Basic Schools.
Each institution will be provided with inputs to cultivate maize, vegetables, and livestock for their own consumption.
Accordingly, a total number of fertilisers has been received for distribution to these schools for the next year's farming season.
Istiqamah SHS at Wenchi was adjudged the Best SHS in Practical Agriculture. This is sad, to motivate them to continue in such commendable efforts and encourage others to follow.
Touching on government policy on the Agriculture sector, the Minister said the government has established Farmer Service Centres for extension service delivery. These are areas where farmers will access extension services and receive supplies for inputs.
I wish to put on record that out of 50 piloted service centres nationwide, the Bono region had 3 to be situated at Wenchi, Sampa, and Wamfie,"" he said
On this year's 41st National Farmers ' Day theme, Feed Ghana, Eat Ghana and Secure the Future, the Minister called on Ghanaians to recommit to eating food produced in Ghana to promote and prioritise local food consumption, such as rice, maize, plantain, yams, cashew, vegetables, and poultry.
""Increased local consumption stimulates production, strengthens value chains, and protects the cedi. A strong taste for consuming foreign foods injects large sums of money into the home economies of such imports to the disadvantage of our own economy, he noted.
On Agriculture modernisation, Akwaboa said it was imperative for farmers to embrace modern technology and scale down the traditional practices of farming to increase production to meet local consumption and for export.
""Embracing Modern Technology includes the use of drones for spraying, digital extension platforms, and climate-smart practices. These are no longer optional but essential for sustaining productivity, he advised.
The Bono Minister also called for the collective pursuit of youth participation in the agriculture agenda and assured them of the government's willingness to continue to support young farmers through training, access to land, mechanisation, and agribusiness financing.
He stressed that this would strengthen partnerships and collaboration between government, private investors, farmer groups, traditional authorities, and development partners to scale up innovations and investments in agriculture for the holistic development of the agriculture sector.
The Minister noted that the Bono region remains Ghanas leading cashew producer, contributing nearly 45% of national output. And to improve tree crop production, the government has rolled out Boosting the Tree Crop
Sector initiative to enhance tree crop production.
Accordingly, the Tree Crop Development Authority (TCDA) continues to provide support for cashew, mango, coconut, and shea value chains.", Imoro T Ayibani,Regional,  8 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Over-200-Dormaa-farmers-set-to-thrive-under-Nkokonkenkete-initiative-2012770
Accra Mayor launches GHC 50K Education Fund for farmers' kids,"The Mayor of Accra, Michael Kpakpo Allotey, has launched a special Education Support Fund for the children of farmers and fishermen in the metropolis.
The fund has been established with an initial seed amount of GHC 50,000.
This total comprises a GHC 30,000 contribution from the Mayor and a GHC 20,000 donation from the Member of Parliament for the Odododiodioo Constituency, Alfred Nii Kotey Ashie.
The initiative sought to, among other things, recognise the critical role farmers and fishermen play in national development and ensure that their children have access to scholarships and other educational support.
Mayor Allotey launched the intervention at the 41st edition of the National Farmers and Fishers Day celebration held at the forecourt of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) on Friday, organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture.
The Mayor said the fund would provide targeted assistance to wards of farmers and fishermen so that no child would be denied an education because of their parents occupation or income level
He explained that the initiative was also intended to make farming and fishing more attractive to the younger generation by demonstrating that these occupations could secure a dignified future for families.
Speaking to journalists after the launch, the Mayor said the initiative complemented the broader support farmers were receiving from the government under the leadership of President John Dramani Mahama, adding that the AMA was aligning itself with this vision by providing targeted assistance to their children.
The Mayor linked the new fund to his wider youth agenda, which focuses on entrepreneurship and job creation.
He cited the example of a young man who recently approached him for GHS 6,000 to start a liquid soap business, and who later returned the capital after successfully producing, selling and making a profit from the venture.
He stated that such experiences had convinced him that with modest but well-targeted support, many more young people could start their own businesses, create jobs, and contribute to the local economy.
Mayor Allotey urged the youth to develop viable business ideas, assuring them that the AMA was ready to support initiatives that would benefit the city and its residents.
The Mayor pointed out that the new education support fund and the youth empowerment drive formed part of a broader strategy to promote dignity in work, expand opportunity and ensure that no child was left behind because their parents were farmers or fishermen.",,Regional,  8 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Accra-Mayor-launches-GHC-50K-Education-Fund-for-farmers-kids-2012768

GETFund accelerates practical science education with STEMBox initiative,"The Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) has reinforced its leadership role in advancing equitable access to modern, practical education with a strategic financing of a nationwide rollout of the Dext STEMBox initiative for basic schools.
The national launch, held on Thursday, December 4, 2025, at the Osu Eben-Ezar Presbyterian Church in Accra was graced by His Excellency President John Dramani Mahama as guest of honour.
The event was also graced by the Minister of Education, Haruna Iddrisu and his deputy Hon. Dr. Clement Abass Apaak, the Greater Accra Regional Minister Madam Linda Ocloo, other sector ministers, traditional authorities, and leaders across the education ecosystem.
In his address, Administrator of GETFund, Mr. Paul Adjei, highlighted the transformative significance of the project within Ghanas education architecture.
He emphasised that the launch represented another strategic move to expand opportunities, increase access, and advance a national commitment to practical and modern learning for every Ghanaian child.
His remarks highlighted the persistent inequalities in access to science laboratories, especially in rural and peri-urban schools, where learning remains predominantly theoretical.
The STEMBox, developed by Dext Technology, is a locally engineered innovation that compresses the capabilities of a full science laboratory into a portable, durable, and cost-effective toolkit.
Speaking to this innovation, Mr. Adjei noted that the STEM Box transforms the capabilities of a full science laboratory into a compact, portable, and cost-effective unit, enabling every learner to build, test, experiment, and explore with full hands-on engagement.
Through GETFunds financial investment, 667 selected basic schools nationwide are receiving STEMBoxes as part of an effort to democratise access to practical science learning.
Mr. Adjei highlighted the intent behind this intervention, describing it as part of a broader national vision, a Ghana where practical science is not a privilege, but a basic prerogative of every child.
He also underscored the economic efficiency of the initiative, explaining that while constructing conventional laboratories requires substantial capital, a STEMBox delivers a comprehensive, curriculum-aligned, hands-on STEM experience without the need for any specialised facility.
This approach dovetails squarely into GETFunds mandate to support cost-effective, high-impact educational infrastructure and learning.
The immediate impact of the initiative is already visible in beneficiary schools, as noted by the Administrator.
Excerpt of his speech reads students who previously memorised definitions can now see concepts come alive in their hands.
Teachers have become more confident in delivering practical science, and communities that once felt marginalised from STEM facilities are witnessing a new sense of possibility among their children.
These changes reflect the potential of targeted public investment in reshaping pedagogical practice and strengthening learners scientific confidence. Beyond immediate classroom outcomes, GETFund considers the STEMBox project a strategic contribution to Ghanas long-term economic competitiveness.
In the words of Mr. Adjei, the initiative supports the emergence of a workforce capable of competing in advanced industrial, technological, and digital economies, signalling that Ghana intends not only to consume innovation but to produce it.
The Administrator also commended Dext Technology for delivering a locally manufactured solution with continental and global relevance, describing the STEMBox as a uniquely Ghanaian innovation that strengthens the national STEM ecosystem.
As the STEMBoxes are formally handed over to beneficiary schools, he reaffirmed GETFunds commitment to supporting interventions that enhance quality learning outcomes for all Ghanaian children, expressing confidence and optimism that the young people who will open these boxes will someday open the doors to new scientific discoveries, innovations, and enterprises that move our nation forward.
Under Mr. Paul Adjei, GETFund is redefining the education space with major transformation and funding sources across multiple sectors such as the Free SHS, Tertiary Education for People with Disabilities (PWDs).

"19,000 miners savings still trapped after financial cleanup - Gbana","The General Secretary of the Ghana Mineworkers Union (GMWU), Abdul-Moomin Gbana, has called on the Bank of Ghana (BoG) to immediately refund the life savings of more than 19,000 miners whose deposits were locked up in financial institutions affected by the 2018/2019 financial sector clean-up.
He made the call at the Unions second-half National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Accra.
Gbana said the affected funds included provident funds, welfare funds, leave savings, individual savings, and severance packages, all placed in BoG-regulated institutions which were later declared weak or insolvent.
He expressed deep disappointment that after more than four years, the workers had still not received their deposits.
He stated that the Union was totally appalled and deeply disappointed in the Central Banks performance as a regulator, saying the BoG had repeatedly assured the public that deposits placed with licensed institutions were safe and that, in the unlikely event of a loss, the Central Bank would take responsibility.
It was on the strength of these assurances, he noted, that miners and the general public entrusted their savings to the affected institutions.
Gbana said the Union found it unacceptable that the Minister of Finance, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, had recently indicated that the Ministry had no money to settle depositors and that the BoG must instead recover assets from the collapsed institutions to pay affected customers, despite acknowledging in the 2026 Budget that the financial sector required GH10.45 billion to address remaining legacy issues.
Establish Ghana Agriculture Service - GAWU to government
He argued that, as the statutory regulator, the BoG owed depositors a fiduciary duty and must therefore fully refund all locked-up funds without delay. He added that the Central Bank could later recover the monies from the liquidated assets of the distressed institutions. Anything short of full payment, he warned, would have severe consequences in the coming days.
The General Secretary said the Unions demand was reinforced by repeated assurances from both the former and current governors of the BoG, as well as findings captured in IMF reports of May 2023 and December 2024, none of which had resulted in the release of members funds.
Addressing Council members, Mr Gbana emphasised that the issue of the locked-up funds had become one of the Unions most pressing concerns, as many of the affected miners had retired or been severed and were depending on these savings for their livelihoods. He noted that the delay had imposed severe hardship on workers who had trusted the financial system in good faith, adding that the Union would therefore not relent in demanding what rightfully belonged to its members.
Gbana also highlighted developments at the BogosoPrestea Mine, describing them as significant for the Unions membership.
He recalled that in November 2024, following months of agitations and demonstrations by the Union, the government terminated the previous leaseholders rights and re-issued the mining leases to Heath Goldfields Ltd after due diligence by the Minerals Commission.
The Union had earlier demanded the termination because the former leaseholder had failed to operate or manage the mine effectively.
He said the re-issued leases came with conditions, the most critical being the settlement of all outstanding indebtedness owed to workers.
Gbana said after months of litigation, Heath Goldfields had now paid a significant portion of the outstanding wages and salaries owed workers and had signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing to settle the remainder within agreed timelines.
He commended the company for the progress made and announced that the mine had reached operational readiness and was preparing to commence production.

Yilo Krobo marks 41st Farmers' Day with renewed commitment to food security,"The Yilo Krobo Municipality in the Eastern Region on Friday, December 5, 2025, celebrated the 41st National Farmers Day at Huhunya with renewed commitments to strengthening food security, modernising agriculture, and empowering the next generation of farmers.
The event, held under the national theme Feed Ghana, Eat Ghana, Secure the Future, brought together traditional leaders, state officials, farmers, development partners, and community members to honour the men and women sustaining Ghanas food system.
Addressing the gathering, the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), Francis Akumatey, underscored the strategic importance of agriculture in Ghanas transformation agenda. He described farmers and fisherfolk as the backbone of the national economy and guardians of food security, adding that the 2025 theme was a call to action for citizens to embrace local consumption and support domestic food production.
According to the MCE, the government of President John Dramani Mahama has embarked on a bold agricultural modernisation drive, including the establishment of agro-industrial hubs for rice, cashew, poultry feed, and onions. The flagship Feed Ghana Programme (FGP), he noted, is reshaping rural economies through small dam construction, irrigation rehabilitation, and the rollout of solar-powered boreholes to ensure year-round water access. These interventions, he said, have contributed to a significant decline in national food inflationfrom 61% in 2023 to 9.5% in October 2025.
Akumatey highlighted Yilo Krobos proactive role in the national agenda, revealing that 211 farmer groups comprising 4,220 farmers have been sensitised under the FGP framework. The municipality also distributed 19,464 oil palm seedlings and 1,000 coconut seedlings to 125 farmers under the Minerals Commission support scheme.
In collaboration with the UN University, the Municipal Agriculture Department completed a climate-friendly gari processing centre at Namusi. The Assembly is also partnering with the Government of the Netherlands to establish a seed bank at Abrewankor to preserve indigenous crop varietiesan initiative the MCE described as critical for safeguarding future food sovereignty.
The Member of Parliament for Yilo Krobo, Albert Tetteh Nyakotey, commended farmers for their indispensable role in national development. He announced that the government will roll out a health insurance scheme for cocoa farmers and accelerate road construction to key farming communities, including HuhunyaBotiTsotsonya, SikabeneAgogoAhinkwah, and HuhunyaAkpoAkapamu. As part of this years celebration, the MP donated a tricycle to the Municipal Assembly for presentation to the 2025 Best Farmer.
Municipal Director of Agriculture, Benjamin Bortey Alabi, urged Ghanaians to embrace local consumption habits as an expression of economic patriotism. He called for greater youth participation in agribusiness through climate-smart technologies, value addition, and modern production methods, noting that a food-secure Ghana is a strong Ghana.
The ceremony celebrated excellence across 23 award categories, including cassava, rice, garden eggs, roots and tubers, vegetable production, livestock, oil palm, mango, pepper, processing, innovation, physically challenged farmers, and youth farmers.
The Overall Best Farmer, Dr Jonas Tetteh Numo, constituency vice-chairman of the ruling NDC, received a tricycle, spraying machine, Wellington boots, cutlasses, egg crates, insecticides, organic fertiliser, and other inputs. Runners-up also received farm machinery, slashing equipment, water pumps, protective clothing, and other essential tools. Joseph Kwadwo Nkrumah, 47, and Adamtey Simon Otis, 45, were named first and second runners-up, respectively.
The 2025 Municipal Best Farmer expressed gratitude for the honour and dedicated the award to all hardworking farmers of Yilo Krobo, including former national best farmers Joseph Kwesi Odjeayem and Davis Narh Korboe. He acknowledged the support of his wife, family, friends, agricultural extension officers, and the Municipal Assembly.
Numo also appealed for stronger government support for the sector, including more agricultural staff, increased funding, improved rural roads, and the provision of storage facilities to reduce post-harvest losses, stressing that these interventions would help position Yilo Krobo as a model of agricultural excellence.
In his closing remarks, chairman of the occasion, Asawatse of Sra and Huhunya, Nene Narh-Korli Bedjrah IV, emphasised the need for financial support for youth to venture into farming, noting that sustainable agribusiness growth depends on empowering young people.
He appealed for government assistance to complete a community-initiated police station, replace the deteriorated public toilet facility, and build a community centre.

Ashaiman chief slams MP over 'misleading' claims on IDA lands,"The Chief of Ashaiman, Nii Annang Adzor, has openly challenged the Member of
Parliament
for the area, Ernest Norgbey, accusing him of dishonesty and disrespect toward traditional authority over matters relating to the Ashaiman Irrigation Development Authority (IDA) lands.
The confrontation occurred during the 41st Farmers Day celebration at the Ashaiman Municipal Assembly, where the MP alleged that private developers were encroaching on IDA lands originally earmarked for agricultural purposes.
According to him, the growing takeover of the land by private entities poses a major threat to agricultural livelihoods within the municipality.
Responding sharply, Nii Annang Adzor dismissed the MPs comments as misleading and politically motivated.
He claimed that the MP had never engaged the Ashaiman Divisional Council on the matter, yet had chosen to present himself as an advocate for farmers on a public platform.
Mr Ernest Norgbey is known for making such claims during Farmers Day celebrations. But today, the people have witnessed the level of dishonesty he displayed. When did he observe these encroachments, and what has he done about them? Can an MP who doesnt engage the Divisional Council speak authoritatively on these issues? he questioned.
The Chief advised the MP to exercise restraint and show respect in his public statements, warning that such conduct could damage his credibility and cause needless tension within the community.
He further noted that political positions are temporary, unlike traditional leadership.
Ashaiman is no longer predominantly a farming community. Years ago, the stretch from the motorway to Lebanon Zone was full of farmland, but urbanisation has changed that. If the MP wants to comment on such issues, he must do so with circumspection. He will one day leave office, but the traditional leaders will remain, he stated.
Despite his criticism of the MP, Nii Annang Adzor urged the youth to take advantage of opportunities in modern agriculture. He highlighted the prospects in agribusiness and assured that farming remains a profitable venture even in a rapidly urbanising environment like Ashaiman.
The event brought together agricultural stakeholders, Assembly officials, and community members, who commended the resilience of local farmers amid growing urban pressure.",,Regional,  6 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Ashaiman-chief-slams-MP-over-misleading-claims-on-IDA-lands-2012515

Parliament
, Zuwera Mohammed Ibrahimiah.
While acknowledging the critical role farmers play in Ghanas economy, the MPs message, delivered by the constituency chairman highlighted a growing sentiment among residents: appreciation alone is not enough.

A key focus of the address was the persistent challenge of poor road infrastructure, which continues to undermine agricultural productivity in the municipality.
Farmers and community members have frequently decried the high cost of transporting goods and the losses incurred due to inaccessible routes.
Responding to these concerns, Abdul Aziz announced progress on several long-demanded road projects.
He confirmed the completion of the SalagaKafaba road and the Kitoe NkwantaKitoe road, noting that these improvements are expected to enhance the movement of goods and reduce post-harvest losses.
Work is also progressing on the Nguan MallamKupi road, with the MPs office promising steady oversight to ensure timely completion.
These targeted interventions are meant to open up our local economy and relieve farmers of the burden of transporting produce on deteriorated roads, he explained.
Beyond agriculture, residents used the Farmers Day platform to raise concerns about lingering community development challenges most notably the unfinished Kwuani community centre, which has stalled for years.
Addressing the issue, the constituency chairman reassured residents that the MP had already initiated steps for work to resume.
He added, By the grace of Allah, construction will begin soon so the facility can finally serve its purpose.

"REGSEC pleads for calm in Kwahu, assures swift investigation","The Eastern Regional Security Council (REGSEC) has urged natives of Kwahu (Kwahuman) to exercise restraint, assuring swift investigation into escalated ongoing chieftaincy disputes.
The REGSEC, led by the Regional Minister, Rita Akosua Adjei Awatey, in a crunch meeting with the Kwahu Traditional Council (KTC) at the Regional Co-ordinating Council (RCC) in Koforidua, expressed her deep concern about the situation in Kwahu, pleading with the chiefs to exercise a little more patience as she delves into concerns in the petition and engages the regional house of chiefs to fast-track the probe into the chieftaincy dispute.
The minister was aggrieved that with the Kwahu traditional area covering about one-third of the whole region and unarguably being the tourism hub, instability in that area would be a big blow to her leadership and the region as a whole, hence her commitment to seeing a peaceful resolution.
She acknowledged that sometimes when the police are sent to carry out an operation, out of stress and pressure, mistakes occur which end up affecting the community members.
She, however, pleaded with the chiefs not to retaliate with force but to allow the authorities to handle the issue.
The regional minister mentioned that on issues of chieftaincy, she seeks counsel from the Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, and seeks guidance.
Notwithstanding, when the topic at hand involves conflict, the matter is referred to the police to handle.
At the local government level, whenever we encounter a chieftaincy escalation, we contact the police for advice and when necessary, we send them to ensure peace and order. They, however, make mistakes sometimes because they are humans and in moments of stress might act differently, she said.
Rita Awatey expressed that the queenmother of Kwahu should just have been invited for questioning and not handcuffed.
She therefore apologised to the KTC and reassured them of addressing the matter at hand.
The minister highlighted her communication with the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Christian Tetteh Yohuno, to discuss the petition presented by KTC to the IGP a week ago.
She added that the IGP indicated sending the petition to her to handle as the head of the security council in the affected region, but she is yet to receive it. Assuring them of a swift response as soon as it is received.
I know the people of Kwahu are highly aggrieved about current happenings and so is the REGSEC because Kwahu plays a critical role in the region and if there is no peace in Kwahu, then we also have no peace of mind at the regional capital.
We also wish the regional house of chiefs will handle this matter swiftly and, when its beyond their level, refer it to the national house of chiefs for justice to prevail, she added.
Leading the KTC delegation, the Kwahu Adontenghene and Chief of Abetifi, Akyemfour Asiedu Agyemang III, explained that the IGP, upon receiving the councils petition, indicated that he did not order the dawn raid and urged them to also petition the Eastern Regional Security Council and RCC, as Kwahu is located in the Eastern Region, hence the reason for the visit.
The IGP said, You are located in the Eastern Region and under the authority of the regional minister in Koforidua, who is responsible for security in the region so try to engage her as well, he said.
He then narrated the background to the destoolment of Eugene Asante Boadi and the processing leading to the enstoolment of Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng, an indication that the kingmakers of Kwahu followed due process.
We know the conflict existed before your appointment into office but the regional house of chiefs for six months now, is yet to address the issue. We plead with you to keep us informed about development related to Kwahu in the future before any raid and also engage the house of chiefs to call the parties for amicable redress for peace to prevail in Kwahu, he said.
Other members of the REGSEC present at the meeting include the Regional Police Commander, DCOP Joseph Owusu, represented by ACP Willams Boateng; Eastern Regional Security Coordinator, Annor Dompreh; and the RCC Director of Administration, Peter Asante.
The KTC were also represented by the Abene Krontihene & Head of Abene Council, Nana Simpe Owiredu III; the Kwahu Baamuhene, Nana Ntim Sampong II; and the Queen Mother, Nana Adwoa Gyemfua III, among several others.

Additional support staff present included the Director of the Business Advisory Resource Centre, Abdul Kudus Yunus, the School Feeding Desk Officer, Alhaji Kramo, the Municipal Budget Officer and Abdul-Rahim Bayason.
After inspecting the temporary office earmarked for DVLA operations, the team expressed satisfaction with the facility.
Yeboah noted that the team had been dispatched by the DVLA CEO and the Minister of Transport to assess the readiness of the proposed office space and assured the traditional authorities and representatives of the MP that a comprehensive report would be submitted to the DVLA CEO and the Minister for further consideration.
Speaking on behalf of the Kpembewura, Lepowura Abdul-Karim Alaja expressed gratitude to the DVLA leadership for responding to the communitys long-standing request.
He stressed that establishing a DVLA office in Salaga remains a top priority for the Kpembewura and appealed to the DVLA CEO, the Minister of Transport, the MP, and the Executive Secretary to the President, Dr Callistus Mahama, to ensure the initiative is realised.
He emphasised that ""the new office would greatly reduce the burden on vehicle and motorcycle owners who currently travel long distances to Tamale, Bole or Yendi to access DVLA services"", adding that the entire Kpembe Traditional Area fully supports the initiative.
The Deputy Coordinating Director of the East Gonja Municipal Assembly, Chief Abu Ibrahim, welcomed the DVLAs move and assured the delegation of the Assemblys commitment to ensuring the safety of DVLA staff and property once operations commence.
He reiterated that maintaining security remains a top priority for the Assembly.
Speaking on behalf of the MP, the Director of Special Projects, Mustapha Nafiu, thanked the DVLA leadership for their prompt response to the MPs request and reaffirmed the MPs commitment to working with all key stakeholders, including the Transport Ministry, DVLA, the Municipal Assembly and the Traditional Authority, to ensure the project materializes.
The inspection visit represents a significant step toward bringing essential DVLA services closer to the people of Salaga and surrounding districts and stakeholders remain optimistic that the establishment of the new office will enhance service delivery, improve convenience for residents and support local development.

Chiefs must not allow galamseyers to destroy their lands - Ellembelle overall best farmer,"The overall best farmer for Ellembelle district of the Western region, Ampong Sakyim, has charged chiefs who are the custodians of lands in Ghana, not to allow illegal miners (galamseyers) to destroy their lands.
""If galamsey activities will stop in Ghana, chiefs or traditional leaders must understand that they are the trustees of lands in Ghana"", he stated.
Ampong Sakyim made the call during this year's Farmers' Day celebration held at Tandan in Ellembelle district.
He commended government for putting decisive measures in place to stop all forms of illegal mining in Ghana.
""In fact, the government is doing well in the fight against galamsey in Ghana and they have put decisive measures in place and we have to commend the government"", he noted.
He emphasised that without the direct involvement of the chiefs, the fight against galamsey in Ghana would be difficult.
""Let me state here that our chiefs are the custodians of our lands in Ghana and if they get involved in the ongoing fight against galamsey by the government, we will win this fight because if a chief says he will not allow anybody to do galamsey on his land, nobody can try it.
So I will use this opportunity to appeal to all chiefs in Ghana to safeguard lands in Ghana"", he stated.

"UMaT emerges as West Africas Fastest-Growing STEM University as student population hits 15,621","The Vice Chancellor of the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Prof. Richard Kwasi Amankwah, has revealed that UMaT has become one of the fastest-growing STEM institutions in West Africa, with a remarkable 479% increase in student enrolment within just five years.
Presenting his report during the 17th Congregation Ceremony on November 29, 2025, Prof. Amankwah said the university has moved from a population of 2,697 students in 2020 to 15,621 students today  a transformation he described as historic and unmatched in the sub-region.
He noted that UMaTs transformation over the last four years has positioned the university as a continental leader in mining, engineering, technology and applied sciences.
UMaT is no longer just Ghanas premier mining university; we are now West Africas fastest-growing STEM institution with a reputation for excellence, innovation and global relevance, he declared.
According to Prof. Amankwah, the growth was the result of deliberate interventions taken during his tenure.
These included the launch of 10 new undergraduate programmes, the expansion of postgraduate admissions across two seasons, the operationalisation of the Essikado Campus, the introduction of new faculties and strategic offices, and support for national TVET and STEM priorities.
He added that although accommodation was initially a challenge, partnerships under the Build, Own, Operate and Maintain (BOOM) scheme helped create more than enough student housing both on campus and within Tarkwa.
In his report, the Vice Chancellor emphasized that UMaT has firmly positioned itself as a leader in digital mining, artificial intelligence and 4th Industrial Revolution technologies in West Africa.
He cited the US$1.5 million Smart Systems Centre, funded by AngloGold Ashanti Iduapriem Mine; the first university-based facility in West Africa capable of printing motherboards, a robotics and autonomous systems lab, a high-performance computing centre, and precision manufacturing equipment as facilities in the university that are propelling the institution to a higher level.
Other facilities contributing to this include: Mining Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory Building, funded under the Ghana Chamber of Mines Tertiary Education Fund. And a new Huawei-built Data Centre to improve ICT security, digital teaching tools and administrative systems.
The Member of Parliament for Tarkwa-Nsuaem, Hon. Issah Taylor, has praised the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT) for its remarkable contribution to national development, describing the institution as a symbol of excellence, innovation and global recognition in mining and engineering education.
According to him, I take great pride in representing a constituency that hosts the finest technical and mining university in Ghana and one of the best in Africa.
Taylor urged residents of Tarkwa-Nsuaem to become proud ambassadors of UMaT, noting that the university continues to elevate the municipality onto the global map through its academic and research excellence.
The Minister for Education, Haruna Iddrisu, in a speech read on his behalf by Professor George K. T. Oduro, Technical Advisor at the Ministry of Education, reiterated the governments strong commitment to strengthening higher education and enhancing research capacity across Ghanas universities.

Greater Accra Minister announces new measures to ease traffic ahead of festive season,"The Greater Accra Regional Minister, Linda Akweley Ocloo, has announced a comprehensive set of measures aimed at ensuring smooth vehicular and pedestrian movement across the region during the 2025 festive season.
Addressing the media and key regional stakeholders at the Greater Accra Regional Coordinating Council on Thursday, December 4, 2025, the Minister said the directives were necessary to manage the anticipated surge in human and vehicular activity.
The Regional Minister, who also chairs the Regional Security Council (REGSEC), noted that Christmas and New Year celebrations typically come with heavy traffic congestion that demands heightened coordination among security agencies, local assemblies and the public.
To address these challenges, Ocloo revealed that the Accra and Tema Regional Police Commands, together with the Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) of the Ghana Police Service, have been instructed to roll out intensified patrols and enforce traffic regulations more strictly.
Additional MTTD personnel will be deployed to well-known congestion hotspots including major intersections, market centres, malls, restaurants, entertainment hubs, clubs and pubs.
In a bid to further ease road blockages, the Minister announced that all abandoned vehicles left along principal streets will be immediately towed to the nearest police station. Owners of such vehicles will be fined GH2,000. She stressed that the move is essential for ensuring unobstructed mobility for both motorists and pedestrians throughout the festive period.
The Minister appealed to commercial drivers, traders, event organizers, restaurant and club operators to cooperate fully by refraining from indiscriminate parking, unauthorized street trading and activities that block pavements or roadways. She added that MMDAs have been tasked to intensify the cleaning of public spaces, especially during peak periods, to maintain a sanitary environment that matches the festive mood.
Touching on sanitation, the Minister disclosed that following directives from President John Dramani Mahama, all Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) must ensure the desilting of choked drains, clearing of bushy road medians and general environmental improvements within their jurisdictions. Failure to comply, she warned, will attract sanctions.
Ocloo also urged residents to heighten their personal security awareness during the festive season. She encouraged the public to promptly report suspicious behaviour or unusual activities to security officers or the nearest police station, assuring that such reports will receive urgent attention.
According to the Minister, the goal of the directives is not to impose inconvenience on the public but to safeguard lives, protect livelihoods and promote a conducive environment for socio-economic activities during one of the busiest times of the year. With collective cooperation, she believes the region can experience a safer and more enjoyable festive celebration.
She concluded by wishing the people of Greater Accra a joyful Christmas and peaceful festive period, expressing hope that residents will celebrate responsibly while supporting efforts to maintain order throughout the season.", Michael Oberteye,Regional,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Greater-Accra-Minister-announces-new-measures-to-ease-traffic-ahead-of-festive-season-2012384
Otumfuo's mediation not a Hearts-Kotoko match for anyone to claim victory - Analyst,"Security analyst Irbard Ibrahim has cautioned that the outcome of Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu IIs mediation effort regarding the protracted Bawku crisis should not be viewed as a contest, such as a match between Accra Hearts of Oak and Kumasi Asante Kotoko, where one side can unequivocally claim victory.
Ibrahim made this observation in light of recent jubilation by representatives of the two feuding factions in the long-standing Bawku chieftaincy dispute, emphasising that premature claims of success are unfounded.
Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II recently concluded his final sessions of the high-level mediation process aimed at resolving the Bawku conflict.
The culminating meeting was held at the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi on Monday, December 1, 2025, with representatives from both the Kusasi and Mamprusi factions in attendance.
Following the meeting, followers from both sides were observed pouring powder on themselves and celebrating, with each faction seemingly claiming a definitive victory.
However, Irbard Ibrahim firmly maintains that the nature of the process means no side can declare an outright win.
Speaking on Nyankonton Mu Nsem on Rainbow Radio 87.5FM, he explained that the role assigned to the Asantehene was mediation, not arbitration.
""In arbitration, one listens to both sides and delivers a ruling determining the successful party. However, in mediation, there are no winners or losers.
""Thus, I was somewhat surprised that each side was celebrating and claiming to have secured victory. This is not a Hearts of Oak versus Kotoko game where one side secures victory.
He stressed that mediation necessitates compromises; each side must agree to relinquish certain demands for the greater collective good. Therefore, nobody should expect that the outcome of the mediation will pronounce one side as the sole owner of the area.
The analyst opined that the current mediation effort may not offer a complete resolution to the crisis.
He proposed that the mediation must be sustained, and concurrent efforts should be deployed to facilitate a face-to-face dialogue between the paramount chiefs leading the two factions.
Ibrahim lamented the significant financial and resource drain the state is incurring in managing the Bawku crisis, noting that this protracted conflict is actively depriving the area of crucial investments and development.
He concluded with an appeal to the populace to allow the conflict to cease, enabling the return of peace, especially considering the tragic loss of lives that the conflict has caused.",,Regional,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Otumfuo-s-mediation-not-a-Hearts-Kotoko-match-for-anyone-to-claim-victory-Analyst-2012299

Bolgatanga Girls Senior High School marks 2nd Speech and Prize Giving Day,"The Bolgatanga Girls' Senior High School (BOGISS) in the Upper East Region has marked its second annual Speech and Prize Giving Day under the theme, Girl Today, Leader Tomorrow.
In her welcome address, the headmistress of the school, Gifty Ayamba, indicated that the occasion was not just a celebration of remarkable achievements but also a reaffirmation of their shared commitment to nurturing girls into transformative leaders of tomorrow.
She further indicated that it is a reminder that every girl who walks through the gate of the school is a seed of leadership capable of rising, influencing, and shaping society tomorrow.
She noted that upon assumption of office, her priority has been to strengthen academic discipline and create a culture of effective teaching and learning.
On the heels of this, she rolled out some initiatives to help cushion her efforts. These initiatives include: early preparation sessions requiring learners to leave their dormitories by 5 p.m. and the strict supervision of prep sessions by teachers residing on campus.
The headmistress observed that academic excellence thrives when supervision, mentorship, and structure are present, and therefore commended the teachers for wholeheartedly embracing these reforms.
The head of the institution, however, stated that despite their commitment to excellence, there are a number of challenges that militate against their efforts towards achieving excellence.
One of such challenges is the current student population of 3,176, which has outgrown the capacity of the dining hall, compelling the school to run a triple-shift track system for students.
The capacity of the dining hall is for 950 students, as the school was built when it had a population of less than 900, she said.
This, the headmistress complained, affects teaching and extracurricular activities, as students have their meals in turns.
She made a passionate appeal for the urgent provision of furniture and the construction of a new dining hall to suit the population of the school.
The headmistress also indicated that at one point, the school was challenged with a limited number of teachers, prompting some volunteers to step in to support.
She also appealed for these volunteers to be absorbed as permanent staff to facilitate the smooth running of the learning institution.
We kindly request that these volunteers be considered for employment to strengthen the human resource capacity of the school and improve the overall functioning of the school, she pleaded.
Madam Gifty stated that despite the challenges at hand, the students continue to excel, adding that the school is proud of the distinguished daughters it has produced.
In the current parliament, two of our old girls are there: Honourable Faustina Elikplim Akurugu, MP for Dome Kwabenya; Honourable Theresa Lardi Awuni, MP for Okaikwei North; and Shiela Azuntaba, Deputy CEO of Consolidated Bank of Ghana.
Their achievement is living proof that the girl sitting in our classroom today can become a leader of national importance tomorrow, she concluded.
For her part, the Assistant Senior Prefect of the school, Millicent Kuni, cited inadequate furniture as a major challenge that is largely impeding their studies.
According to her, some of the students sit on the bare floor, with others leaning on broken desks during lessons.
Some of our sisters in Form One sit on bare floors or lean on broken chairs. Imagine trying to dream big while trying to find a place to sit. It is painful, and it must change, she cried.
Another pressing issue the Senior Prefect brought to bear was insufficient classrooms to contain the growing population of the school, a situation she described as uncomfortable.
Our classrooms are full. Too full. The dream of learning becomes harder when you must fight for space to breathe, write, or see the board clearly, she bemoaned.
The situation has compelled the school to convert the Science, ICT, and Food and Clothing laboratories into ordinary classrooms.
The Assistant Girls' Prefect expressed worry that the move tends to dash their dreams of becoming scientists, engineers, and innovators, as they only learn theoretically without the practical aspect, in an era where STEM and vocational skills are increasingly becoming indispensable.
We dream of being scientists, engineers, innovators, but we learn theory without practicals, she echoed.
The occasion was put together through the efforts and leadership of the Old Girls' Association of the school (BOGSOGA).
Students received awards in the areas of brilliance, discipline, innovation, and leadership.
The awards were sponsored by some of the old girls of the school and the Dr Kenneth Elvis Anewenah Foundation.", Sarah Dubure,Regional,  4 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Bolgatanga-Girls-Senior-High-School-marks-2nd-Speech-and-Prize-Giving-Day-2012249
Ghana Post rolls out door-to-door Christmas delivery initiative,"In a heart-warming celebration that blended music, gratitude, and the spirit of giving, Ghana Post on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, held its maiden Christmas Carols Service, an event that marked a refreshing chapter in the companys history and reflected its renewed commitment to serving Ghanaians with warmth, speed, and reliability.
The ceremony brought together staff, partners, and stakeholders in a beautifully lit hall filled with uplifting hymns, soul-stirring choral performances, and messages of hope. For many members of the Ghana Post family, it was more than just a gathering; it was a moment of reflection, thanksgiving, and unity after a year of hard work and transformation.
But the day offered more than music and celebration. It also became the platform for the much-anticipated launch of Ghana Posts festive initiative: Delivering Joy to Your Door.
Speaking at the event, the Managing Director of Ghana Post, Madam Rita Sraha, shared the heart behind the initiative, describing it as a gift from the national postal service to the nation during a season defined by love and connection.
We want to bring joy to your doorstep, she said. Ghana Post delivers parcels, letters, and anything you want to send to your loved ones. This season, we want to make it even more joyful, with more efficiency, more speed, and more care. We are ready and on standby to deliver joy to the people you love.
She emphasised that this is the first time Ghana Post is combining a carols service with a company-wide competition among its departments, divisions, and units, a move designed to strengthen internal bonds and energize staff for the busy season ahead.
The campaign invites every Ghanaian, individuals, retailers, SMEs, and corporate institutions, to entrust their deliveries to Ghana Post, whether hampers, books, gifts, or customer packages. With delivery operations already in full swing, the Mada Rita Sraha noted that the companys motorbikes and logistics teams are gearing up for a bustling Christmas period.
We are targeting everybody, she explained. If you have something to send, a hamper, a book, gifts for schoolchildren or relatives, bring it to Ghana Post. We will deliver with love and professionalism.
For some of our existing customers, we will offer discounts based on volume. For others, well show appreciation in various ways. This season is about recognizing our customers and inviting them to grow with us.
She also encouraged the public to use only the official website, www.ghanapost.com cautioning against fraudulent sites mimicking Ghana Posts brand.
The only trustworthy link is our official website. Please do not fall for scams. Ghana Post is reliable, and we will continue to deliver.
Reflecting on the companys recent achievements, Mada Rita Sraha highlighted the impressive workflow handled in Ghana Posts passport delivery service, which has successfully processed over 80,000 passports. This, she noted, is a testament to the companys strengthened capacity and readiness for high-volume operations.
We will update the media as we go along, sharing our volumes and showing the true impact of our Delivering Joy initiative, she assured.
To every Ghanaian, we wish you the very best. Keep giving. Keep believing. And allow us, Ghana Post, to help you deliver joy to the people who matter to you.
As Christmas draws closer, Ghana Post stands poised not only as a logistics provider but as a messenger of hope, connection, and heartfelt service", Muhammed Faisal Mustapha,Regional,  4 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Ghana-Post-rolls-out-door-to-door-Christmas-delivery-initiative-2012248

PROTOA dismisses Kofi Soga over GH360k financial misconduct and other offences - NEC confirms,"The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Progressive Transport Owners Association (PROTOA Ghana) has officially confirmed the dismissal of Joshua Kofi Sogapopularly known as French Man and formerly a member of Peace PROTOA, Koforidua Branch.
The dismissal has been in effect since 2021 but has now been publicly announced following the conclusion of a prolonged legal dispute.
The decision comes after a final court judgment delivered on 28th June 2024, which brought closure to disagreements between the Association and the dismissed member.
According to PROTOA, Soga was removed from the Association based on four major grounds: financial misconduct, insubordination, a criminal conviction and conduct deemed unbecoming of a member.
In a dismissal letter signed by the National Chairman of PROTOA Ghana, Benjamin Agorsu Katsekpor, the Association stated that Soga, while serving as Interim Management Committee Treasurer, allegedly acted together with Francis Akaglo to unlawfully withdraw GH360,120 from the Peace PROTOA bank account.
An audit conducted by AGEN Business Consult reportedly confirmed the financial discrepancies.
PROTOA said this conduct breached Regulations 5 and 6 of its national Code of Ethics.
The Association further indicated that Soga was convicted and sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, a situation which automatically disqualifies him from voting or contesting for any office under Article 16 of the PROTOA Constitution.
In addition, PROTOA accused Soga of insubordination for allegedly refusing to cooperate with a three-member council established to oversee Peace PROTOA operations during the period of investigations.
The NEC also cited his alleged repeated engagement in disruptive and inappropriate behaviour at the lorry stationactions they say tarnished the Associations image and disrupted its smooth operations.

DVLA launches new number plate and vehicle registration initiative to curb illegal activities,"The Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) has announced a major nationwide initiative aimed at abolishing illegal vehicle and number plate registrations across the country.
The exercise, which begins on January 1, 2026, and runs until April 2027, is expected to strengthen road safety and enhance vehicle monitoring systems nationwide.

Asante highlighted major challenges with the old number plate system, which he described as outdated and vulnerable to abuse, leading to increased cases of illegal registrations.
He emphasised that the new number plates will be embedded with RFID chip technology, allowing the DVLA to track and verify vehicles more efficiently.
He further cautioned vehicle owners to be vigilant when handing their vehicles to others and urged the public to fully participate in the registration exercise to support the Authoritys efforts.

Eastern Regional Minister inspects ongoing works on Krobo roads,"Correspondence from the Eastern Region
The Eastern Regional Minister, Rita Akosua Awatey, has toured several major road and drainage project sites in the Krobo enclave, assuring residents that construction works  halted for months due to delayed payments  have fully resumed and will continue until completion.
The government has assured residents of uninterrupted progress after payment delays halted major road and drainage projects, sparking demonstrations and public outrage in the Krobo area.
The minister was joined by the Municipal Chief Executives (MCEs) for Lower Manya Krobo and Yilo Krobo, John Atter Matey and Francis Addo Akumatey, respectively, along with engineers supervising the works.
The team inspected ongoing projects at Agormanya and Mampong, where critical drainage and road reconstruction efforts are underway to address persistent flooding and poor road conditions, as well as in Somanya, and the Somanya RoundaboutAsitey corridor.
Background: Stalled Works and Public Demonstrations
The resumption of works follows a long period of frustration among residents, commercial drivers, and traders after the multi-phase road construction project begun in June 2024, stalled for ten months (January to November, 2025).
Communities along the Agormanya-Somanya-Asitey stretch had repeatedly appealed to the government after the worsening road conditions, eroded drains, and stagnant construction created safety hazards and hampered economic activities.
Contractors later confirmed that the stoppage resulted from delayed payments from the government, forcing heavy machinery off-site and leaving key portions of the road exposed and vulnerable during the rainy season.
Minister: The Mahama Government is Fulfilling its Promise
During the inspection, the regional minister expressed satisfaction with the pace of ongoing works and praised the Minister of Roads and Highways, Kwame Governs Agbodza, for ensuring the resumption of the project.
I extend my gratitude to the Roads Minister [Kwame] Agbodza. President Mahama is fulfilling his promises. The contractors, General Construction Limited, are doing a good job. This is a listening government, she said.
She acknowledged that the works have caused inconvenience to households and businesses situated along the construction corridor, but urged residents to remain patient.
We know the importance of good roads; it facilitates trading activities and improves livelihoods. The works are causing inconveniences to homes by the roadside, but we shall certainly benefit from it in the long run, she added.
According to Rita Akosua Awatey, renewed discussions with contractors have secured commitments that they will remain on-site until the project is completed, ensuring no repeat of the earlier abandonment.
Everybody should be aware that works have resumed. Some roads have been closed to traffic to pave the way for construction, so drivers should be patient. These disruptions will be short-lived, she assured.
Contractors Project Completion by end of 2026
Project Manager for General Construction Limited, Billy Brigham Deku, also provided updates on progress of the project.
Work is in progress, so far so good. We have no challenges. We ask for the cooperation of the people. All necessary inputs for smooth construction have been provided,"" he assured.
He explained that significant drainage construction is underway, particularly at Agormanya and Mampong, where perennial flooding has long plagued residents.
Were doing a quality job. Because we are using heavy and sometimes dangerous equipment, road users should cooperate. Motorable bypasses have also been created for the convenience of drivers, he explained.
Deku acknowledged that the earlier stalled works would push the projects completion timeline forward.
We expect to complete the major concrete works by August 2026, after which we will proceed with dressing, sealing, and final touches, he added. .
New Hope for Residents
The inspection tour has reignited optimism among residents who have long endured delays, poor drainage, and inconsistent project timelines.
With full construction activities now back on track, road users and residents are hopeful that the long-awaited road transformation will soon usher in safer travel, improved business flow, and long-term flood resilience.

In a statement issued to mark World AIDS Day, the Chief Executive Officer of the Foundation, Esther Kakie Ayimavor, popularly known as Naana Kakie, emphasised the need for early and age-appropriate instruction on health, sexuality, and infection prevention from the preschool level.
She noted that early-childhood education forms a crucial foundation for informed decision-making, improved health awareness, and responsible behaviour later in life.
Integrating basic concepts on infection prevention and HIV awareness into kindergarten and lower primary school curricula, she said, would help children develop a clearer understanding of the disease, reduce stigma, and build confidence as they mature.
The Foundation expressed concern about emerging HIV statistics and the vulnerabilities faced by young people, especially in high-prevalence regions. Current data from the Ghana AIDS Commission and national surveillance indicate that the Greater Accra Region has the highest number of people living with HIV, estimated at 77,821.
This is followed by the Ashanti Region with 54,824 and the Eastern Region with 42,386.
Regarding prevalence among persons aged 1549, the Bono Region leads with 2.22 per cent, followed by the Eastern Region at approximately 2.08 per cent and the Ahafo Region at about 1.88 per cent. The North East Region continues to record the lowest prevalence at 0.43 per cent.
Despite progress made in expanding treatment access and reducing AIDS-related deaths, the Foundation observed that prevention efforts among young people remain inadequate.
It therefore urged stronger collaboration between the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ghana AIDS Commission, and civil society organisations to ensure schools become frontline platforms for sustained HIV prevention education.
The Naana Kakie Foundation stressed that empowering children with accurate knowledge at an early age is vital to building a generation that is better equipped to protect itself and contribute to national efforts to end HIV/AIDS.", Michael Oberteye,Regional,  3 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/NGO-calls-for-strengthened-HIV-AIDS-education-in-basic-schools-2012044
Baidoo Japhet shares inspiring journey as KsTU valedictorian,"By Nana Peprah
Amidst the jubilant atmosphere of Kumasi Technical University's (KsTU) 23rd congregation ceremony for the 2024/2025 academic year, Baidoo Japhet was declared the valedictorian, the institution's best graduating student.
Addressing fellow graduands, faculty, and dignitaries, Japhet delivered a moving speech that traced his miraculous academic journey from basic school to international exchange, ushering him into his Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering.
Opening his address, Japhet reflected on his evolving understanding of success.
""If you had asked me a few years ago what it takes to pass an exam, I would have confidently said: work hard, stay focused, avoid distractions, simple. But if you ask me that same question today, my answer would be quite different.""
Japhet's educational path began at Ahinkofi Primary School, continued through Ketan M/A Junior High School, and led him to Sekondi College for his secondary education before he joined Kumasi Technical University.
He described his initial days on campus as a ""strange blend of confusion, excitement, and wonder,"" grappling with an unfamiliar environment, expectations, and culture.
A pivotal moment in his journey was his selection for an academic and cultural exchange program in China, facilitated by KsTU's international partnerships.
He shared the daunting challenge of securing his flight ticket, an obstacle that nearly derailed the life-changing opportunity. ""But I thank God for the family He blessed me with, especially my parents, who rallied together and supported me until the dream became reality,"" he stated.
As an international student, Japhet recounted daily lessons in resilience, navigating a new climate, adapting to a new language, adjusting to unfamiliar teaching styles, and embracing an entirely different cultural setting.
These experiences, he noted, strengthened his adaptability, broadened his global perspective, and increased his confidence to thrive in diverse environments.
""The technical knowledge I gained, coupled with the cultural exposure, has equipped me with a solid foundation for the journey ahead,"" he affirmed, expressing deep gratitude to KsTU for such transformative opportunities.
Japhet extended heartfelt thanks to his lecturers and mentors for their unwavering dedication, guidance, and inspiration both inside and outside the classroom.
""You did not only teach; you inspired. Your dedication has shaped our character, instilled our values, and prepared us for life beyond the university. We are forever grateful.""
His profound appreciation was particularly directed at his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Baidoo.
""I owe you more than words can express. Your strength, courage, and unwavering determination continue to inspire me. Today is as much your victory as it is mine. You sacrificed, encouraged, reassured, and ensured that I never missed an opportunity. Your love opened the doors that led me here. God richly bless you. I love you so much,"" he stated.
Mr Baidoo graduated in First Class honors with a CGPA of 4.73; an outstanding performance that shook the university and all dignitaries present.",,Regional,  3 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Baidoo-Japhet-shares-inspiring-journey-as-KsTU-valedictorian-2012027
Kwahuman Global Network worried about rising environmental degradation,"The Kwahuman Global Network (KGN) has expressed concern over the rising environmental degradation in Kwahu, attributed to illegal mining, popularly known as galamsey.
Obrempong Ansong Dwamena, convenor of the Kwahuman Global Network, Europe and North America branch, in a statement signed and copied to the Ghana News Agency in Koforidua, said the reckless and destructive practice has inflicted significant harm on our natural environment, endangering the livelihoods of farmers, the future of our children, and the very survival of our traditional area..
He said our rivers were polluted, fertile farmlands destroyed, and entire communities poisoned with toxic heavy metals.
The particular concern is the exposure of vulnerable children, who absorb these hazardous substances at far greater rates than adults, placing them at serious risk of chronic and irreversible health complications.
He said "" the ongoing contamination of our soil, food, and water constitutes not only an environmental catastrophe but also an urgent public health emergency. We are confronting an existential peril. ""
Obrempong Dwamena said "" Kwahu citizens in the diaspora are deeply disturbed by the apparent indifference and complacency of certain traditional authorities who, despite their custodial duty over our ancestral lands, remain passive as these destructive practices continue unchecked. ""
The leadership of KGN therefore called on all stakeholders, traditional leaders, government officials, civil society, and community representatives, to unite and take immediate, decisive action to confront these atrocities against our land and our people.
We demand accountability from all chiefs and local leaders who enable, tolerate, or turn a blind eye to galamsey operations.
He said the proud heritage and reputation of Kwahu must not be compromised by the greed and self-interest of a few who prioritize personal gain over the collective welfare of our citizens.
The Kwahuman Global Network urged the Municipal and District Chief Executives (MCEs/DCEs) of Kwahu to demonstrate firm leadership by enforcing environmental laws and halting these illegal activities without fear or favour.
He stressed that "" the time for inaction and pretense is over. Our farms, forests, and rivers, the very foundations of our peoples sustenance, are being destroyed by individuals, often non-natives of Kwahu, aided by local collaborators.
This is a national disgrace that must be condemned by all conscientious citizens.
"" Let us stand together to defend our land, our people, and our future. Kwahu must not be allowed to decline under our watch,"" he said.",,Regional,  3 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Kwahuman-Global-Network-worried-about-rising-environmental-degradation-2012022
80% of doctors posted to Upper West didn't show up for duty,"The Upper West Regional Health Administration has reported that about 80% of doctors allocated to the region for the 2025/2026 service period did not report to duty.
The administration said 25 out of the 32 doctors allocated to the region not accepting to the posting have left a huge gap in the medical workforce.
Dr Josephat Nyuzaghl, the Upper West Regional Director of Health Services, bemoaned the development, forecasting it would have a huge negative impact on the quality of healthcare available to a region with nearly one million residents.
JoyNews reports that there are only 55 active medical doctors in the region, meaning each has to attend to a staggering 18,181 patients.
The hope was the arrival of new doctors would improve the situation.

Falling tree kills two timber workers at Bekawopa,"A tragic incident has left Bekawopa community in shock after two chainsaw operators were suddenly killed by another tree near Abrafo in the Twifo- Hemang- Lower- Denkyira District of the Central Region.
The deceased, Yaw Asare known as Tompuu in his 50s and Eric Tetteh in his 30s, were reportedly cutting down a timber when the unexpected occurred.
According to eyewitness accounts, the men were cutting down one tree when a firm tree nearby, abruptly came crashing down on them.
Residents described the incident as mysterious, with some suggesting possible spiritual influences due to the unexplained collapse of the tree.
The unusual nature of the tragedy prompted traditional leaders to perform customary rites at the scene before the bodies were allowed to be moved.
Police officers from the Jukwa District Command later transported the remains to the mortuary for preservation.

Let us rally behind Armah-Kofi Buah to succeed - Ashanti Caucus founder,"The founder and president of Ashanti Caucus in Ellembelle Constituency of the Western region, Wofa Atta, has called on Ghanaians to rally behind the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah to succeed in the fight against galamsey.
Ashanti Caucus is one of the groups that canvassed votes for the national Democratic Congress (NDC) and Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah in Ellembelle Constituency in 2024.
It was established in 2012 by Wofa Atta at Elubo in Jomoro Constituency with the main aim of canvassing votes for NDC.
So far, Ashanti Caucus has over 400 registered executives and members in Ellembelle Constituency.
Speaking to Daniel Kaku at Nzema Aiyinasi on Sunday, November 30, 2025, Wofa Atta emphasised that he would not dissolve the group and pledged to extend their activities to other Constituencies.
He commended the executives and members of the group for devoting their precious time to attending meetings every Sunday.
""I established this Ashanti Caucus for NDC at Elubo in Jomoro 2012 to campaign for Francis Anaman to become MP in 2013 and we worked harder for the party, I left Jomoro late to settle at Nzema Aiyinasi in Ellembelle Constituency and for the love I have for the party, I didn't collapse the group, in 2020, we campaigned for Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah and John Dramani Mahama but John Dramani Mahama did not win, after 2020 elections, I didn't collapse it, I continued with it till 2024 and we won both parliamentary and presidential elections"", he stated.
""As I speak to you now, we have over 400 people who have registered and after the 2024 elections, we have been meeting on every Sunday after church at Nzema Aiyinasi in order to maintain the members and executives who are NDC members.
""Another reason why I have not dissolved the group is that I want to maintain the base and spread the good news of NDC government so that in 2028, NDC will have it simple in Ellembelle because 2028 is just around the corner and I have pledged myself to work forever for NDC, I always think about the development of NDC than anything so I will use whatever I have to support the party to be attractive in Ellembelle Constituency"", he added.
Wofa Atta commended President John Dramani Mahama for placing trust in Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah as his Lands and Natural Resources Minister.
He stated that Armah-Kofi Buah was a hardworking man and believed he would not disappoint President John Dramani Mahama in the fight against galamsey.
""As for me, I believe strongly that Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah will achieve a lot at the Lands and Natural Resources Ministry and he will not disappoint President John Dramani Mahama"", he stated.
He therefore, commended Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah for stopping galamsey activities in his Constituency, Ellembelle.
""Let me use this platform to commend Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah for his leadership style, before 2025, Ellembelle was one of the galamsey Constituencies in Ghana, a lot of Chinese nationals came here to do galamsey with excavators but today that Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah is the Lands Minister, the galamsey activities had stopped and I will be difficult for anybody to enter any galamsey site or forest in Ellembelle with excavator"", he said.
Wofa Atta concluded by urging the good people of Ellembelle Constituency and Ghanaians to rally behind Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah to succeed in the fight against illegal mining (galamsey) in the country.

"GCTU Congregation: Inclusive education is national strength, not charity - Apaak","Deputy Minister of Education Dr Clement Apaak has urged graduates of the Ghana Communication Technology University to view inclusive education as a pillar of national strength rather than an act of charity.
Addressing the 35th Congregation of GCTU in Accra on Saturday, November 29, on behalf of the Minister for Education, Dr Apaak said Ghanas development depends on innovation that expands access and ensures that no community or learner is left behind.
According to him, the countrys rapid adoption of Fintech, artificial intelligence, and digital tools must translate into fair opportunities for all.
Our progress must be equitable, Dr Apaak noted, emphasising that innovation must function as a bridge connecting rural communities to global opportunities.
He added, Technology should encourage girls in STEM, support learners with disabilities, and make knowledge accessible with dignity.
Dr Apaak highlighted milestones such as Free SHS, the no-fee-stress policy, and free education for persons living with disabilities, but insisted that Ghana must reinforce its commitment to inclusive education.
This is not charity, he said. It is a strategy for national strength.
He identified persistent barriers facing rural learners, girls from poor households, and persons with disabilities, stressing that government interventions must deliberately address these inequalities.
Some communities lack the infrastructure needed to compete, he explained. We cannot build a digital economy that leaves them out.
Dr Apaak outlined key government commitments, including investments in digital infrastructure for underserved districts, accessible curricula with local language support, and assistive technologies tailored to learners with special needs.
He also pointed to targeted teacher training and strengthened public-private partnerships to ensure wider digital access. We are expanding connectivity and devices so that opportunity is not determined by geography or disability, he said.
Turning to the graduating class, Dr Apaak encouraged them to adopt three guiding principles as they enter the world of work.
He urged them to think inclusively, build sustainably, and support others along their professional journey. Ask yourselves who might be left behind by your design, he said. Let your conscience direct your creativity.
He praised parents, guardians, and lecturers for their sacrifices and commended the GCTU administration for shaping the next generation of technology leaders.
Addressing the graduates, he said, This celebration is a solemn promise that you will use your skills to uplift communities and help build a Ghana where prosperity is genuinely shared.
Dr Apaak ended by assuring the country that the future remains secure when innovation is rooted in fairness and national responsibility.",,Regional,  2 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/GCTU-Congregation-Inclusive-education-is-national-strength-not-charity-Apaak-2011918
GCTU Congregation: Innovation must drive inclusion  Apaak tells GCTU graduates,"Deputy Minister of Education Dr Clement Apaak has told graduates of the Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU) that Ghanas technological progress must be anchored in inclusion and national equity.
Addressing the 35th Congregation of GCTU in Accra on November 29 on behalf of the Minister of Education, Haruna Iddrisu, Dr Apaak said innovation has become the defining currency of national development, but warned that technology must never widen existing inequalities.
We are living in a time when digital tools, Fintech, and artificial intelligence are transforming every sector, he said. But this transformation must work for every Ghanaian, not just a privileged few.
Dr Apaak stressed that innovation should act as a bridge connecting rural communities to global opportunities and enabling girls and persons with disabilities to learn with dignity.
Our progress must be equitable, he noted. Innovation must function as a bridge that links aspiration to opportunity for all.
He highlighted government interventions such as Free SHS, the no-fee-stress initiative, and free education for persons living with disabilities, stating that a stronger commitment to inclusive education must support these.
This is not charity, he said. It is a vital strategy for national strength.
The deputy minister pointed to persistent obstacles in rural communities, including limited infrastructure, economic disadvantage among girls, and the need for accessible learning tools for persons with disabilities. He argued that addressing these barriers is essential to sustaining Ghanas digital growth.
Some communities are being held back by structural gaps, he said. If we ignore these gaps, we undermine the countrys potential.
Government, he assured, is investing in robust digital infrastructure in underserved areas, accessible curricula with local language support, and assistive technologies to aid learners who require them.
He added that targeted teacher training and public-private partnerships will be expanded to improve digital access.
Connectivity and devices must reach every corner of the country, he said. We cannot build a modern Ghana by leaving entire groups behind.
Turning to the graduating class, Dr Apaak urged them to commit to inclusive thinking, sustainable building and mentoring others.
Ask yourself in every project: who might this leave behind? he advised. Let your conscience guide your creativity, not just profit.
He praised parents, guardians and lecturers for their sacrifices and commended the GCTU administration for nurturing the next generation of Ghanaian innovators.
Your university has given you both skill and vision, he told the graduates.

Why some NDC constituency executives want Mahama to sack Nanton DCE,"Some constituency executives of the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) in the Nanton District of the Northern Region have petitioned President
John Dramani Mahama
to remove the District Chief Executive (DCE), Rosina Abdul Rahaman, over allegations of incompetence and actions they say undermine the partys credibility.
According to a December 2, 2025, report by citinewsroom.com, the executives argue that the DCEs continued stay in office threatens the partys electoral fortunes in the district.
Speaking on behalf of the group, Mohammed Sharif accused the DCE of diverting agricultural inputs meant for vulnerable farmers under a key government support initiative.
President Mahama receives 10 petitions seeking removal of EC chair, Special Prosecutor
He alleged that subsidised fertiliser supplied through the Savannah Agriculture Value Chain Development Project was diverted and sold to private retailers under the DCEs directive.
About 600 bags of subsidised fertiliser allocated to the district were diverted and sold to private retailers under the direction of the DCE, Sharif claimed, the report said.
He stated that the alleged diversion had eroded the trust of farmers, describing them as a critical support base for the party in the district.
This act is a betrayal of the trust of our farmers. It is a departure from the NDCs principles of accountability and an act of corruption that has angered the very people who stood with the party in difficult times, he indicated.
Presidency forwards petitions for removal of EC Chair, Deputies & Special Prosecutor to Chief Justice
The report added that the executives have, therefore, appealed to President John Mahama to intervene and appoint a new DCE, whom they believe will help restore confidence and advance the partys development agenda in the district.
They maintain that immediate action is necessary to prevent further damage to the partys reputation ahead of future elections.

Mayor of Accra leads citywide kerb-painting exercise,"The Mayor of Accra, Michael Kpakpo Allotey, has led a citywide exercise to paint kerbs along major roads in preparation for the Christmas season, as part of efforts to beautify the capital and enhance safety at night.
The exercise, which began on Saturday, involved the painting of kerbs along medians and road shoulders from John Evans Atta Mills High Street through to Independence Avenue to improve visibility and eliminate dark spots across the city.
Speaking to journalists during the operation, the mayor said the kerb-painting exercise had been combined with an intensive citywide sweeping campaign, disclosing that 190 personnel had already been deployed across the metropolis to support the effort, with an additional 400 to be employed soon to scale up the exercise and create jobs for the youth.
The mayor explained that the fresh kerb markings would significantly improve road safety by enhancing visibility for drivers at night, helping motorists to clearly identify medians, road edges, and reducing the risk of accidents along the citys major routes.
He explained that the exercise forms part of the Assemblys commitment to give Accra a renewed, clean, and vibrant outlook during the festive period and called on residents as well as business operators to play their part by keeping their surroundings clean and supporting ongoing sanitation activities.
The mayor used the opportunity to encourage unemployed young people to visit the Accra Metropolitan Assembly to join the cleaning and beautification teams, stating that each person would be paid GH100 daily for a period of 30 days.
During the exercise, the mayor cautioned a man who was sweeping waste from a pharmacy frontage onto the pavement, warning that such acts were punishable by the Sanitation Court.
He advised business owners to maintain clean frontages, especially as the Assembly undertakes efforts to improve the appearance of kerbs and median strips across the city.
He also directed the painting teams to give the peeling walls of the High Court complex a facelift as part of the ongoing works, noting that public facilities must reflect the citys commitment to orderliness and beauty.

WaterAid Ghana Director celebrated as Bongo rolls out sanitation campaign,"In a colourful display of tradition blending with development, the Bongo Traditional Council has launched an ambitious ""Sanitation Challenge,"" aiming to eliminate open defecation by 2028.
The historic durbar, held on Saturday, 29th November 2025, also saw the enskinment of the WaterAid Ghana Country Director, Ewurabena Yanyi-Akofur, as Kosom Pognaba (Queen of Clean Water).
The atmosphere in Bongo was charged with a renewed sense of purpose as Naba Baba Salifu Atamale Lemyaarum, the Paramount Chief of the Bongo Traditional Area, rallied his people against the twin challenges of poor sanitation and water scarcity.
The launch of the challenge signals a departure from reliance solely on external aid, moving towards community-led solutions to safeguard the dignity and health of the people.
A centrepiece of this initiative is the establishment of the Bongo Traditional Area WASH Fund. Spearheaded by the Traditional Council, the fund is designed to finance the construction of household latrines for the vulnerable and install sanitation facilities in strategic public locations.
This move comes as a direct response to the persistent gaps in hygiene infrastructure that have long affected the health and education of children in the district.
In a move symbolising the deep partnership between the community and development partners, Ewurabena Yanyi-Akofur was installed as Kosom Pognaba.
The title recognises her relentless advocacy in tackling Bongos fluoride contamination crisis and expanding access to clean water.
Accepting the honour, the newly installed Queen Mother described the title as a call to service rather than a celebration of status.
Water is more than a resource. It is life. It is dignity. It is the foundation upon which families build their dreams, Madam Yanyi-Akofur told the gathering.
She added, To be entrusted with a name that carries the spirit of water reminds me that true leadership is service. As Kosom Pognaba, I accept the responsibility to walk with this community with listening ears and an open heart.
The Paramount Chief, Naba Baba Salifu Atamale Lemyaarum, emphasised that the time for complacency is over. He noted that water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are not luxuries but fundamental human rights that underpin the productivity of the land.
He charged the youth, elders and the District Assembly to support the new WASH Fund, stressing that ""development begins with collective effort and community responsibility.""
The launch of the Sanitation Challenge is a critical commitment to the Bongo WASH Compact, a landmark agreement signed by the chiefs and stakeholders in August this year.
By moving swiftly from signature to action, the Traditional Council has proven that the Compact is a living framework for development, not just a ceremonial document.
Backing the initiative, the Regional Minister, Akamugri Donatus Atanga, praised the Bongo Traditional Council for its innovative approach to development.
He pledged the Regional Coordinating Councils full support, describing the target to end open defecation by 2026 as bold but achievable if the community remains united.

Create equal opportunities for girls in IT - Prof Diyawu appeals,"Correspondence from the Northern Region
The Executive Director of the Centre for National Distance Learning and Open Schooling (CENDLOS), Prof Diyawu Mumin, has called for equal opportunities for girls in Information and Communication Technology in the country.
As the country invests heavily in technology, Prof Diyawu said there is the need for girls and children with disability to be encouraged to take career paths in the digital industry as that sector is the future of world.
Prof Diyawu was speaking at the National Annual Stakeholders Meeting of the Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED Ghana) in Tamale last Wednesday.
He emphasised that technology, when used intentionally and equitably, can serve as an equalizer, breaking down barriers that hinder progress and development, such as geography, gender, disability, and socio-economic circumstances.
""We must ensure that the bright future we envision welcomes every girl, every child with a disability, and every learner in rural and underserved communities.
""When used intentionally and equitably, technology becomes an equalizer, breaking down barriers of geography, gender, disability, and social circumstances,"" Prof Mumin said.
Prof Mumin also underscored the need for Ghana to make the right decisions regarding the future of its digital industry.
He stressed that the choices made today will shape the nations future leaders and determine the success of its digital transformation.
""Across the world, societies are accelerating towards a digital future, where the ability to access information, use technology, and create knowledge defines the opportunities available to every child, every family, and every nation.
""Here in Ghana, we stand at a defining moment. The decisions we make today, the partnerships we build, the investments we prioritize, and the values we uphold will shape the next generation of thinkers, innovators, creators, and leaders he added.
Prof Mumin commended CAMFED for its ongoing efforts to empower women and girls in Ghanaian communities, noting that its model of collective action, mentorship, and lifelong empowerment is key to national development.
Over the years, CAMFED has demonstrated that when you empower a girl, you empower an entire community. When you support a young woman to learn, to lead, and to innovate, you uplift families and build generational change.
""Your model of collective action, mentorship, and lifelong empowerment is not only inspiring but also essential to national development, he added.
The national stakeholders meeting of CAMFED was on the theme; Empowering the Next Generation Through Education and brought together various stakeholders including traditional and opinion leaders, educationists, teachers and students and CAMFED beneficiaries across the Northern Region.
Esther Akomaning, the Board Chair of CAMFED reiterated its commitment towards complementing governments efforts to achieve its education and women empowerment goals.",,Regional,  2 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Create-equal-opportunities-for-girls-in-IT-Prof-Diyawu-appeals-2011881
Fmr Offinso North NDC PC aspirant in critical condition after near-fatal road crash,"Correspondence from the Ashanti Region
Nana Yaw Baffour Frimpong, a former parliamentary aspirant for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in Offinso North, is in critical condition at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital following a near-fatal road accident on the Kumasi-Bechem Highway.
The incident occurred while Nana Frimpong was driving on the Bechem-Kumasi stretch after attending an event in Japeikrom.
Sources indicate he was forced to swerve sharply to avoid a head-on collision with a speeding oncoming truck that reportedly veered into his lane.
His vehicle, a saloon car now extensively damaged, then crashed into a roadside object and plunged into a bush.
Frimpong sustained serious injuries and was rushed to the hospital's emergency unit, where he is currently receiving treatment.
It is suspected that the truck driver may have been attempting to avoid potholes, a common issue due to the poor state of that section of the road.
Emergency services quickly arrived at the scene, and the swift intervention of the ambulance service is credited with preventing a potentially more tragic outcome.",,Regional,  2 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Fmr-Offinso-North-NDC-PC-aspirant-in-critical-condition-after-near-fatal-road-crash-2011878
Pupils of Dormaa Akwamu Methodist JHS study under poor conditions as project stalls,"Correspondence from the Bono Region
Pupils of Methodist Junior High School in Dormaa Akwamu in the Dormaa East District of the Bono Region are studying under trying conditions due to the absence of a proper classroom block.
The absence of a safe and supportive atmosphere where learners can learn and thrive continues to create an unfavourable learning environment that is undermining the schools ability to deliver quality education.
With pupils of the school learning in a deteriorated and open-sided structure whose roof is rusted and riddled with noticeable gaps offering little protection from wind, dust, or rain, the Headteacher Gabriel Kpante Kosie indicated that the situation is a matter of grave concern since the infrastructural challenge is not only disrupting academic activities, but also putting the well-being of both pupils and teachers at risk.
We are doing our best as teachers, but without proper infrastructure, our efforts are limited. The children deserve better, and when there are inadequate facilities, both pupils and teachers are forced to work under conditions that hinder effective teaching and learning, which affects the most motivated learners to concentrate under such conditions, he said.
A pupil of the school, Oppong kyeremeh, bemoaned that the condition of the classrooms has significantly diminished their motivation to learn, ultimately affecting their overall academic performance and desire to participate actively in learning activities.
Appeal for the completion of the abandoned classroom block
Gabriel Kpante Kosie stressed that the only meaningful way to address the worsening situation is for immediate action to be taken to complete an abandoned classroom block, which is near completion.

ISOC Ghana empowers over 900 participants in online safety outreach,"Correspondence from the Bono Region
The Internet Society Ghana Chapter (ISOC) has organised a three-day NexGen Online Safety Outreach Project in the Eastern Region for teachers and students of Oyoko Methodist and Kpone Community Day Senior High Schools.
Also part of the project were some youth groups at Begoro, in an effort to cultivate safe and responsible online practices among young people.
More than 900 participants were taken through hands-on training that emphasised spotting scams, maintaining privacy, using strong passwords, making safe digital choices, the risks associated with careless online behaviour, as well as a keynote on digital footprints.
Participating students used the opportunity to talk about their online experiences, demonstrating a deep and practical understanding of safe digital habits, testimonies that reflected how the lessons from the outreach were already influencing their behaviours, and a real-life example that underscored the immediate impact and relevance of the training.
In her opening remarks, the President of the ISOC Ghana Chapter, Maud Ashong Elliot, emphasised that the core mission of the association is to help shape a new generation of smart, secure, and responsible digital citizens noting that as technology evolves rapidly, young people must be equipped not only with digital skills but also with the awareness and discipline needed to navigate the online world safely.
Our mission is to nurture a new generation of smart, secure, and responsible digital citizens because, as technology evolves at a rapid pace, it is crucial that young people gain not only the technical skills but also the awareness and discipline needed to navigate the online world safely, she said.
She underscored ISOC Ghanas commitment to continuing its efforts to empower young people with safe online practices and reminded participants of the critical importance of staying safe online.
She also urged them to take proactive steps towards protecting their privacy and safeguarding their personal information, as every post, click, and interaction leaves a digital footprint.
Speakers like Dr Seth Alornyo, Cyber Security Expert and a Lecturer, Mr Gabriel Ofori Appiah, Director of Operations, Outreach and Awareness, Ghana Internet Safety Foundation and Dr Justice William Asare, Patron of the Koforidua Technical University Campus Chapter, briefed participants on how to navigate the digital space with greater caution and confidence.
They also underscored the need for users to limit the amount of personal information they share online and to adopt stronger security measures to protect their privacy in an increasingly connected world, respectively.

Success of Ghanas transition from crude to gas hinges on cost-reflective tariffs - Report,"A joint analysis by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and KPMG, an auditing firm, has affirmed the Governments strategic shift from light crude oil to domestically produced natural gas for power generation.
The report, however, stressed that the initiatives ultimate success hinged on implementing transparent tariff-setting mechanisms and cost-reflective tariffs.
The report highlighted the potential the transition had to drastically cut electricity production costs and bolster energy security.
The report comes amid governments plan to leverage increased gas production from the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP), Jubilee, and TEN fields for power production as announced in the 2026 budget by the Minister of Finance.
The minister also announced recent infrastructure upgrades and new agreements with partners to boost gas supply, paving the way for the construction of a new 1,200-megawatt state-owned thermal power plant starting in 2026.
While the move from crude oil to gas is projected to reduce generation costs by approximately 75 per cent, the UNDP-KPMG report cautioned that those savings must be effectively managed across the entire electricity value chain to ensure sustainability.
The report noted that for the benefits to fully materialise, transparent tariff-setting mechanisms and cost-reflective pricing would be essential to ensure the financial viability of sector players.
Government announces 120% tariff increase to bolster NHIS
The principle underscored the need for the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) to adopt pricing models that accurately reflected the actual costs of production, transmission, distribution, and supply.
That approach was critical to maintaining the operational and financial health of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo), and independent power producers, while also preventing undue financial pressure on the national budget.
The governments parallel initiatives, including feasibility studies for mini-hydroelectric plants on the Red Volta and other southern rivers, align with broader goals to diversify the energy mix and integrate renewable sources.
However, the stability of the entire sector, as highlighted in the report, remained fundamentally linked to a financially sound tariff structure.
The analysis suggested that without cost-reflective tariffs, the sector could face renewed cycles of debt and underinvestment, potentially undermining the gains from the cheaper gas-based generation.
It said transparency in the tariff-setting process was also cited as vital to building public trust and ensuring that pricing adjustments were understood and accepted by consumers.

Adjena-Tafoman leaders battle VRA over 100-Acre land ownership dispute,"Correspondence from Eastern Region
Tension is mounting in Adjena-Tafoman in the Asuogyaman District of the Eastern Region following a renewed land dispute between the Volta River Authority (VRA) and the Adjena Land Management Board.
Members of the board, clad in red attire to signify their dissatisfaction, reported to the Akosombo Police Command this week after being invited to assist in investigations into an alleged encroachment case reported by VRA and the Forestry Commission.
According to the board, the police invitation stemmed from claims that the community was encroaching on portions of the VRAs maritime enclave. But the Adjena Land Management Board insists the VRA has no legitimate claim to the land in question, citing a failed agreement dating back almost a decade.
Speaking to the media, the secretary to the board, Onyaa Kwadwo, said the current dispute can be traced to discussions held in 2016 between VRA and the traditional authorities of Adjena. Those discussions, he said, led to an agreement that gave VRA permission to undertake certain activities within the maritime area under specific conditions.
One of the key clauses required VRA to meet certain financial obligations to the community, he explained. The agreement was clear that failure to meet these obligations  for three calendar months would result in automatic termination. They defaulted for more than that period, and when we engaged them, they openly said they were no longer interested in the agreement.
Kwadwo added that following the breakdown of the agreement, the landestimated at over 100 acreswas rented out to private investors who have since completed their registrations. However, the board claims VRA recently returned to express renewed interest in reclaiming the land, a move the chiefs and community leaders strongly rejected.
The matter escalated when the VRA allegedly removed a container placed by the land management board on a section of the property. They carried our container away and have refused to return it for two weeks now, Kwadwo alleged.
They are using security forces to intimidate the community. But our message is clear: VRA should go to court if they believe they have a case. Their mandate is to generate hydropowernot to appropriate lands for investors, he added.
Several indigenes echoed similar frustrations
Mohammed Atiemo, a resident, accused the VRA of decades of injustice against the people of Adjena. From our forefathers till today, VRA has cheated us, he noted.
Atiemo also alleged systemic discrimination, claiming indigenes were routinely denied employment opportunities at the VRA despite possessing required qualifications.
The residents have demanded that the VRA remove all signposts it has erected across the disputed area within one week, insisting they would not sit aloof while their lands are taken.
Another resident, Ama Asabea, linked the tension to unfulfilled resettlement promises dating back to the construction of the Akosombo Dam.
She claimed the community was displaced without receiving the schools and development support allegedly promised to them.
Even the only senior high school in our community has been neglected, she added. They bring soldiers, Forestry personnel, even Navy officers to intimidate us. But we are now awake.
The VRA has not yet publicly responded to the communitys renewed allegations.
The Akosombo Police Command are conducting further investigations into the issue.",,Regional,  2 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Adjena-Tafoman-leaders-battle-VRA-over-100-Acre-land-ownership-dispute-2011854
Asenso-Boakye boosts modernisation of Bantama Palace,"Correspondence from the Ashanti Region
The Member of Parliament for the Bantama Constituency, Francis Asenso-Boakye, has made a huge contribution to support the ongoing renovation of the Bantama Palace.
The MP made the contribution during a recent visit to the palace, where he commended the Bantamahene, Baffour Owusu Amankwatia VI, for his steadfast support of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) and for allocating land for a constituency office.
He also emphasised the crucial role of cultural institutions in national development.
During his visit, Asenso Boakye underscored the profound importance of traditional leadership and heritage.

Invest in Volta to secure Ghanas food future  Dr Kwamigah-Atokple to agric minister,"The 41st National Farmers Day Agricultural Fair and Exhibition opened in Ho on Monday with a strong call for Ghana to deepen investment in agriculture and position the Volta Region as a national model for food security and agribusiness transformation.
Delivering the keynote address, the Volta Regional Representative on the Council of State, Dr
Gabriel Tanko Kwamigah-Atokple
, underscored the critical role of every actor across the agricultural value chain, stressing that agriculture is about the entire system of people whose effort moves food from the soil into society.
Referring to a morning incident in which his regular food vendor was absent, he said the experience revealed how the absence of one person could ripple through an entire community, illustrating how farmers, processors, food vendors and consumers are interdependent.
Atokple told the gathering that food security is national security, warning that Ghana risks instability, vulnerability and dependence without strong domestic production.
He highlighted agricultures influence on health, industry, nutrition and employment, calling it the backbone of Ghanas development.
The Council of State member praised the selection of the Volta Region as the host of the 2025 Farmers Day, describing it as recognition of the regions fertile lands, abundant water bodies, reliable rainfall patterns and hardworking people whose farming heritage stretches across generations.
He noted that young people in the region are increasingly venturing into commercial farming, aquaculture and climate-smart vegetable cultivation.
Dr Kwamigah-Atokple appealed directly to the Ministers for Food and Agriculture and for Fisheries and Aquaculture to fully integrate the region into the governments new interventions under the NDC administration, including the Agriculture for Economic Transformation Agenda, Farmer Service Centres, the Farm Bank initiative, and the National Agribusiness Policy.
With our land, our waters, and our hardworking people, this region can show what these policies can be achieved. The people of the Volta Region are ready, he added.
The Council of State Member, who is also a rice farmer, emphasised the regions growing role in domestic rice production and urged deeper investment in irrigation, seed improvement, milling and storage to reduce Ghanas dependence on imports.
Beyond rice, he pointed to significant potential in cassava, maize, fruits, cocoa, poultry, piggery and aquaculture, saying the Volta Lake alone offers enormous opportunities for modern fish farming that can supply both Ghana and neighbouring countries.
He also cited expanding greenhouse farms and a new generation of youth deploying climate-smart technologies.
The Council of State member cautioned that persistent structural challenges are holding farmers back. These include rising input costs, limited mechanisation, poor access to credit, post-harvest losses, climate variability, bad roads and unreliable market prices.
Farmers, he said, require stronger cooperatives, fair pricing, robust extension services and improved water management to withstand droughts and flooding.
Call for Mindset Change and National Commitment
On policy and national outlook, Dr
Gabriel Tanko Kwamigah-Atokple
stressed that Ghana must elevate agriculture into a respected, technology-driven career path.
Agriculture must be seen as a dignified, profitable and technologically-advanced career, he said, urging reduced barriers to land access and increased private investment in agribusiness.
He called transformation of the sector a national mission that requires discipline, innovation and collective determination.
Closing his address, Dr Kwamigah-Atokple paid tribute to farmers and fishers, describing them as the quiet architects of our nations stability, while praising their resilience and sacrifice.
He also indicated that; They rise before dawn, labour under the hot sun... They do this not for applause but because the survival of families and communities depends on their courage.
He urged Ghanaians to feed Ghana, eat what we grow and secure our future, reiterating that both the Volta Region and the country are ready for a new era of agricultural transformation.
The ceremony featured the arrival of dignitaries, cultural performances by the Dzidzorkporkpor Borborbor Group and Volta CNC Folkloric Group, and addresses by the Volta Regional Minister, James Gunu; the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Emelia Arthur; and the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Eric Opoku.

District Assemblies cited in Auditor-Generals report may lose points in PFMCLT,"The Centre for Local Governance Advocacy (CLGA) has called for stronger accountability measures as stakeholders recommend that Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) cited in the Auditor-Generals Report should lose points in the upcoming 2025 Public Financial Management Compliance League Table (PFMCLT).
This recommendation emerged during a multi-stakeholder technical meeting convened by CLGA to review and validate the draft 2025 PFMCLT Assessment Tool.
The meeting brought together key institutions across the Public Financial Management (PFM) chain and civil society organisations.
Stakeholders raised concerns that some Assemblies continue to record significant financial irregularities, yet the current scoring framework does not adequately penalise them.
It was therefore strongly proposed that MMDAs cited in the Auditor-Generals Report for misappropriation, non-compliance or other financial infractions should lose marks under the Auditing Indicator.
This, they argued, would strengthen deterrence, promote responsible use of public resources, and improve accountability to citizens.
Participants also highlighted inconsistencies in quarterly reporting to the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC).
Many MMDAs consistently fail to submit mandatory quarterly performance reports, a situation that undermines planning effectiveness and national data reliability.
It was recommended that Assemblies that default should lose points under the Planning Indicator to reinforce compliance with regulatory reporting obligations.
On procurement, stakeholders proposed reforms to ensure that the PFMCLT promotes local economic development.
They suggested that Requests for Quotations (RFQs) should give priority to sourcing from local firms, while National Competitive Tendering (NCT) and other methods should be assessed in ways that encourage transparency, value for money and inclusiveness.
The meeting forms part of ongoing efforts to strengthen the PFMCLT as a national accountability tool that objectively measures MMDA compliance with PFM laws, regulations, and best practices.
The 2025 edition is expected to incorporate these recommendations to ensure the tool remains robust, credible, and reflective of the realities within Ghanas local governance system.

In a statement, Professor Abavare expressed his frustration with the discussion, questioning why Muslim students would choose to attend Christian schools if they were not prepared to abide by the institutions rules and traditions.
Without any iota of doubt, if a person chooses to attend a Christian or Islamic school, it is a choice they have made, and they must be prepared to abide by the rules, values, and rituals of that institution, Professor Abavare stated.
He emphasised that secondary schools are places of training and moulding minds, not centres for personal religious practice, and urged students to comply with the schools rules without exception.
Professor Abavare also cautioned against bending the precepts of institutions to accommodate individual preferences, warning that this could lead to further demands and dilute the character and identity of these institutions.
He cited the example of the Armed Forces, where individuals must put aside their personal preferences for the greater good, and urged Ghanaians to respect the traditions and rules of institutions that were established long before the current constitution.
The statement has sparked a range of reactions, with some praising Professor Abavare for speaking out and others criticising him for taking a hardline stance.",,Regional,  1 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Follow-school-rules-or-stay-away-KNUST-UTAG-President-on-Wesley-Girls-brouhaha-2011642
Ga South Assembly set to exhume wrongfully buried body at Oboum,"The Ga South Municipal Assembly has ordered the stoppage of an unauthorised cemetery development at Oboum, leading to the exhumation of a body that was wrongfully buried on a privately owned parcel of land.
According to the issue, the landowner, Eric Bedford Nii Quaye, revealed that he was alarmed to learn that a section of his land located near a river had been allocated by unknown persons, believed to be local traditional authorities or their assigns, for use as a cemetery.
According to him, one body had already been buried without his knowledge or consent.
I have a land at Oboum. There is a river around there, and I understand that the chief or whoever gave the land out as a cemetery knew all these. One dead body was already buried there, he said.
The land is mine, so I reported it to the necessary authorities.
An order was given for the police and the Assembly to go and exhume the body, so I can reclaim my land. I have all documents over the land title and everything that shows the land is mine, he told journalists during an interview.
Following his complaint, the Ga South Municipal Assembly, under the authority of the Municipal Chief Executive Moses Kabu Kubi Ocansey, authorised a team of environmental health officers, accompanied by the police, to carry out the exhumation.
The exercise, when carried out successfully, will ensure that the land returns to its rightful owner.
According to the Assembly, no authorisation had been granted for the location to be used as a cemetery, stressing that such activity, especially near a waterbody, violates municipal environmental and public health regulations.
The Assembly says it is taking steps to engage all relevant stakeholders to prevent similar incidents and ensure that land use in the municipality follows proper legal and health guidelines.",,Regional, 30 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Ga-South-Assembly-set-to-exhume-wrongfully-buried-body-at-Oboum-2011636
"Three men attack Dabala market, targeting Woyome brothers and Agave Chief","Tension is heightening in the Agave Traditional Area after a viral video captured some men identified as Amehoho and Richard popularly known as fitter engineer described by residents as hooligans storming the Dabala main market and using a public address system to publicly brand the Woyome brothers and the Paramount Chief of Agave, Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV, as thieves and criminals.
The incident, which has sparked widespread public condemnation, is believed to be part of an escalating smear campaign allegedly orchestrated by some self-styled wing chiefs and queenmothers who are battling for legitimacy within the Agave chieftaincy structure.
Viral video sparks outrage
In the video intercepted by this news outlet, the three men are seen walking through the market while loudly announcing through a PA system:
We are live in Dabala main market. Woyome brothers and Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV are thieves and criminals. They are not true Agave citizens and have no authority to enstool a Paramount Chief, one of the hoodlums stated.
Their actions provoked sharp criticism from traders and residents, most of whom condemned the public insults and accused the men of acting on behalf of individuals seeking to destabilize the traditional leadership.
Legal action looms
The attack appears to be the latest in a series of coordinated assaultsboth verbal and written  against the Woyome brothers, Hon. Kwabena Mensah Woyome, a former MP for South Tongu, and his elder brother, Mr. Alfred Agbesi Woyome.
The brothers have now threatened to take legal action, including a defamation suit, against several individuals they accused of publishing fabricated stories, inciting confusion, and attempting to delegitimize the Paramount Chief.
They argued that many of the so-called wing chiefs and queenmothers leading the smear campaign were illegally gazetted by a former Volta Regional House of Chiefs (VRHC) registrar, Henry Attipoe, without approval from the Agave Traditional Council.
Attorney-Generals report adds another twist
Documents sighted by this outlet, including an Attorney-Generals report dated August 23, 2022, reference 75 individuals, including the same wing chiefs, in a criminal matter:The Republic vs. Solomon Amehoho.
Charges include,Abetment of robbery, Abetment of rioting with offensive weapons, Acting as a chief contrary to Section 63 of the Chieftaincy Act, 2008 (Act 759).
This has further deepened public suspicion about the credibility of those attacking the Woyome brothers and Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV.
Protests against the Woyome brothers
On Monday, November 24, 2025, a group of traditional leaders and their supporters staged a protest and petitioned President John Dramani Mahama, accusing the brothers of meddling in Agave chieftaincy affairs.
They alleged that the brothers were outsiders and had used their past political and diplomatic influence to interfere in the installation of chiefs. The Woyome brothers, however, insist these claims are baseless and motivated by personal interests.
Woyome brothers respond
In a press briefing in Accra on Thursday, November 27, 2025, the brothers rejected all allegations, describing them as fabrications designed to destroy our integrity.
They stated: ""They never installed or supported the gazetting of the current Paramount Chief, Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV (Edward Allan Agbeti).
Their family has a long-standing reputation in legal practice, making it unlikely they would involve themselves in illegal traditional processes.
Several of their accusers lack legitimate royal lineage and are themselves facing credibility issues.
They further expressed disappointment that those who had once sought their support and financial assistance had now turned against them, even attacking the memory of their late mother and deceased sister.
Alleged police complicity
The Woyome brothers also raised concerns about the conduct of ACP Takpa, a senior officer at the Sogakope District Police Command.
They accused him and the South Tongu DISEC of:
Helping the protestors defy a court order and a directive from the Volta Regional Security Council banning the demonstration
Ignoring the Attorney-Generals indictment against some of the protest leaders
Escalating tensions within the traditional area
They claim their timely intervention prevented a counter-protest by youth and legitimately installed chiefs, which could have led to violent clashes.
Background to the chieftaincy dispute
The dispute dates back to 2011 and 2012, when factions within Agave submitted conflicting petitions concerning the installation of a new Paramount Chief. Documents show groups within the Tsiala Clan, Yelu House Gate and other royal families have consistently disagreed on the rightful heir.
The matter has long been before the Judicial Committee of the Volta Regional House of Chiefs, and the Minister for Local Government and Religious Affairs recently directed the committee to prioritise the hearings.
Court injunction against rival installation
The Sogakope High Court recently issued an injunction stopping the installation and outdooring of another paramount chief, after reports emerged that a rival faction was secretly planning to install its own candidate.
The injunction upholds the authority of Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV, who was lawfully sworn in on October 9, 2024, and inducted into the VRHC on October 15, 2024.
Call for calm
Woyome urged residents to disregard the fake, inaccurate and self-serving propaganda being circulated by what he described as a small group of divisive individuals.
He reaffirmed the commitment of his family to Peace, Rule of law, Respect for traditional processes and constructive engagement.
He warned those spreading defamatory content to stop before legal action is taken.", Kay Agbenyega,Regional, 30 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Three-men-attack-Dabala-market-targeting-Woyome-brothers-and-Agave-Chief-2011622
Tribal comment sparks backlash against Dominic Nitiwul,"Dominic Nitiwul
, former Minister of Defence and one of the most influential figures in the Bawumia campaign, is facing intense criticism after reportedly telling Konkomba delegates in Bimbilla that
Kennedy Agyapong
does not like them.
Video evidence showed he urged the delegates to back
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, claiming that Konkombas nationwide were already supporting him and warning that choosing Kennedy would disgrace their community.
The remarks have triggered anger across the party. Many describe the comments as reckless and unnecessary, arguing that this kind of tribal messaging divides the party rather than strengthens it. They believe delegates should be engaged with ideas, plans and competence, not fear or ethnic labels.
According to insiders, worries about tribal undertones in sections of the Bawumia campaign have been building for months, but this latest episode has pushed the concerns into the spotlight.
Party members are calling for leadership intervention to prevent the situation from escalating and affecting unity ahead of the January 2026 primary.
Observers warn that if such rhetoric continues, it risks damaging relationships in key constituencies and shifting focus away from the issues that actually matter to delegates and the grassroots.

'Adopt new technologies to establish your career in job market'  TVET Director General urges graduates,"The Director General of the Technical and Vocational Educational Training (TVET), Dr Eric Adzroe, has urged graduates of the technical and vocational training programmes to constantly improve upon their skills by adopting new technologies required to firmly establish themselves in the career job market.
Know that your chosen trades are now highly dynamic and constantly evolving. To remain relevant and competitive, therefore, you must keep upgrading your skills, continue learning, take short courses and adopt new technologies, he emphasized.
Dr Eric Adzroe was speaking at Ho, the Volta Regional capital, during the graduation ceremony for 44 students of the Evangelical Presbyterian Hoffman Memorial Vocational Institute.
The institute was established as E.P. Activity Centre in 1997 through the initiative of Mrs Brigitte Hoffman, a German citizen.
Dr Adzroe encouraged graduates of TVET to take advantage of the governments newly introduced programmes, such as the National Apprenticeship Programme (NAP), Workplace Experience Learning (WEL) and the TVET Qualification Frame (TQF) to enhance their proficiency in employable skills and promote their economic independence.
He lauded the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana, in complementing the governments skills training programmes aimed at contributing to youth unemployment in the country.
The Principal of E.P. Hoffman Memorial Vocational Institute, Rita Etornam Ahadzi, disclosed that the Institute has been granted accreditation to offer NVTI Certificate 1 and 2 in addition to Proficiency One and Two, adding that since 1998, the institute has trained more than 700 graduates in various vocations.
She said the institute has well-furnished classrooms, training workshops with equipment and hostel facilities to meet the demands of the students, and therefore encouraged young people who have completed Junior High School to opt for vocational and technical skills training.

Amenfi Central MP praises Mahama as father of possibilities on the occasion of his 67th,"Joana Gyan Cudjoe, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Amenfi Central in the Western Region, has showered President
John Dramani Mahama
with praises, describing him as ""father of possibilities"" and ""an angel of God in human form,"" on the occasion of his 67th birthday.
In a message released online, the legislator commended the president, tying the presidents political trajectory to immediate economic benefits for Ghana, claiming that the mere anticipation of his ""second coming"" has had a transformative impact.
The MP began her tribute by expressing profound gratitude for Mahamas life and praying for continued divine protection.
""We're so grateful to God for your life. May the good Lord continue to bless your remaining years on earth. Ayikoooo, Sir,"" she stated.
Claiming Economic Transformation
The political highlight of MP Joana Gyan Cudjoes message centered on radical claims regarding the current state of the Ghanaian economy, attributing recent perceived stabilisation directly to the influence of President Mahamas potential return to office.
She asserted that the possibility of his second term has already ushered in ""significant improvement in the Ghanaian economy.""
To substantiate this claim, the Amenfi Central lawmaker specifically pointed to key market indicators, including ""cedi appreciation to the dollar"" and a noticeable ""reduction in diesel and petrol"" prices across the country.
Ghana Transformed into 'Heaven'
Going further in her highly complimentary remarks, Gyan Cudjoe used hyperbolic language to describe the purported impact of the opposition leaders political presence.
She asserted that President Mahama has already transformed Ghana into ""Heaven"" in his ""second coming,"" signaling overwhelming confidence in his leadership capabilities ahead of the upcoming general election.

Old student champions call for decent toilets at Dadease Agric SHS amid health concerns,"An old student of the Dadease Agriculture Senior High School has made a passionate, urgent appeal to all other past students of the school to come to the aid of the current student population.
Doreen Aboagye, who completed the school in 2014, said that the appeal has become most pressing because the students of the school are facing a threat of a health scare if a befitting toilet facility is not constructed for them.
Speaking with
GhanaWeb
via phone, Doreen explained that the students currently have a very difficult situation with attending to natures call, a situation that is ultimately affected their overall learning experiences at the school.
Doreen lamented that while the school has past students from as far back as the early 1990s, there is hardly any attention given to it after they leave school.
Apart from the 2009-year batch and some of us who recently completed the school, it is near impossible to reach out to our past students to help. The old people, some are from as far back as from 1994 and although the school has not existed for that long, we are burdened with a lot of school projects that need their attention.
Governments have been supporting in their own but in all honesty, if we decided to leave everything on the government to do, we may achieve very little. They need a toilet facility badly because the situation is not looking good at all. It has not been easy for the school at all, she lamented.
She further added that while the situations in the school persist, she is hopeful that through appeals like these and publications of this nature, some of their old students can reach to the school management and find the best ways out in helping them resolve their challenges.
I am confident that when the past years bathes and individuals come together, we can bring some sanity back to our school. I really hope people respond to this clarion call and lets come together to uplift the image of our school, she added.
After she left school and relocated outside the country, Doreen Aboagye has returned occasionally to give back to the school.
Notably, she made presentations to the school in 2019, 2020, 2022, and in 2024, which is located in the Ashanti Region, off the Kumawu Road.

Woyome family denies allegations of role in installation of chief,"Former Member of Parliament (MP) for South Tongu in the Volta Region, Kwabla Mensah Woyome, together with his elder brother, Alfred Agbesi, has threatened legal action  including a defamation suit  against some divisional chiefs, queenmothers, traditional office holders and other individuals over what they describe as malicious and false publications against them.
Their legal threat follows a series of public statements and media reports by a group of traditional authorities accusing the Woyome brothers of unlawfully interfering in the affairs of the Agave Traditional Area.
The allegations arise from ongoing internal conflicts within the Agave chieftaincy structure. On Monday, November 24, 2025, the said chiefs, queenmothers and their supporters staged a protest and petitioned President John Dramani Mahama, urging him to halt what they described as systematic and unlawful interference by the Woyome brothers in chieftaincy matters.
According to the protestors, the brothers are outsiders to Agave customs and therefore unqualified to play any role in traditional leadership issuesan allegation the Woyome brothers reject, arguing that the accusers themselves lack proper bloodline to the Agave royal paramount stool.
The Woyome brothers do not fit the traditional priestly role in Agave. By customs and laws, they are considered outsiders. Despite this, they have used their previous positions one as a former Consul and the other as a former MP  to meddle in chieftaincy matters that do not concern them, the petition alleged.
They further accused the brothers and the Volta Regional House of Chiefs (VRHC) of installing and gazetting a self-styled Paramount Chief under his private name a practice they claim is alien to Agave tradition.
In a swift rebuttal, the Woyome brothers dismissed all allegations, describing the claims as lies manufactured by individuals pursuing selfish interests.
They couldn't fathom why these strangers would rather attract their integrity by peddling false claims against them who are royal of the Agave Traditional Area.
They noted that several of the traditional leaders leading these attacks have had their own statuses questioned due to allegations of false claims and improper conduct.
Woyome also explained that when the Agave Paramount Chieftaincy dispute was formally brought to his attention in 2011 and 2012, many can attest that his elder brother, Alfred Agbesi Woyome, was already in court pursuing his own legal matters and could not have been involved in any installation process.
So anytime the elders in the area needed financial support, they channelled their requests through me. But the claim that we were involved in the installation of Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV as Paramount Chief is simply not true, he clarified.
The brothers expressed displeasure that the chiefs and queenmothers defied a lawful directive from a competent court  and reportedly from the Volta Regional Coordinating Council  to stage a protest aimed at tarnishing their reputation.
According to them, the November 24 protest exposed the naivety, selfish interests and unlawful conduct of the demonstrators, whom they also accused of spreading fake news and defamatory content on social media.
They insist that the false publications have severely damaged their reputations, prompting their decision to seek legal redress.
The brothers revealed they have already consulted their lawyers, who are preparing to file suit against what they describe as unscrupulous individuals in the Agave Traditional Area.
They also lamented that some individuals they had previously helped financially have now joined forces with the protestors to attack them, including dragging the integrity of their late mother into the controversy, a development they described as painful and degrading.
The brothers further accused the senior police, with the Sogakope District Police Command, ACP Takpa, of helping the chiefs and queenmothers of Agave to defy a court order and a directive from the Volta Regional Security Coordinating Council that prohibited the protest.
According to them, the conduct of the senior police officer and the South Tongu District Security Committee (DISEC) suggested that they believed themselves more powerful than the regional security authority  hence their decision to disregard the directive.
Speaking to journalists in Accra on Thursday, November 27, 2025, the brothers dismissed viral claims that they supported the VRHC to install and gazette Edward Allan Agbeti (known traditionally as Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV) as Paramount Chief of Agave.
The allegations that Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV was a criminal and had been sacked from the Dzodze Senior High School (DZOSEC) were reportedly made by a rival faction, likely connected to an ongoing chieftaincy dispute in the Agave area.
Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV and his supporters, including other chiefs and queenmothers, have consistently refuted these claims and have taken legal action, including obtaining a court injunction to stop attempts by the rival group to install another paramount chief.
This publication is a complete fabrication. We have never supported the VRHC to crown Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV whose private name is Edward Allan Agbeti  or any other person as Paramount Chief of Agave. We have no involvement whatsoever. Our hands are clean, they stressed.
They emphasised that they were raised in a family steeped in legal discipline  with both their father and grandfather being legal practitioners  making it unlikely for them to engage in unlawful acts or acts that undermine traditional norms.
They maintained, however, that they had played significant roles in helping resolve longstanding disputes within Agave, particularly conflicts between churches and the traditional council over annual bans on drumming and noise-making.
They believe the current protest is a personal attack intended to undermine their peace-building efforts, adding that the evil plans of their enemies have failed.
Mensah Woyome traced the origins of the dispute to 2011, when some elders  including the current Awadada of Agave  approached him at Parliament seeking his support for the outdooring of Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV.
Shortly afterwards, however, he received a protest petition from the elders of the Yelu House Gate of the Tsiala Clan, led by Togbe Yelu Keteni V.
That six-page petition, dated October 21, 2012, alleged that a secret and unconstitutional attempt was underway to install a new Hlitabo. It was addressed to the Chairman of the South Tongu DISEC and copied to the IGP, National Security, BNI, CHRAJ, the Dabala Magistrate Court and other security agencies.
The petitioners warned that certain factions  including the Awadada from the Tievie Clan (which they argued was outside Agave), the Hlitabo family at Agorme and Dabala, and staff of the late Togbe Degenus palace  were attempting to hijack the paramountcy.
According to Woyome, this demonstrates that the installation of Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV has long been a contested matter, still pending before the VRHC.
He said that on May 5, 2025, he wrote to the Minister of Local Government and Religious Affairs requesting expedited hearings by the VRHC Judicial Committee to help bring clarity and peace to the traditional area.
The minister reportedly responded by directing the Judicial Committee to prioritise the matter.
Woyome accused certain traditional office holders of interfering with the ongoing chieftaincy dispute before the VRHC and expressed disappointment that chiefs were tarnishing his image despite his efforts to help mediate and resolve the conflict.
He also noted that some of the same chiefs protesting against him today had previously resisted attempts to resolve disputes between the traditional council and churches over noise-making regulations.
Woyome urged the public, especially residents of the Agave Traditional Area, to disregard the inaccurate, false and self-serving information being circulated about him and his brother.
He reaffirmed their commitment to lawful conduct, peaceful dialogue, and respect for both traditional and constitutional processes.
He advised those spreading falsehoods to desist from their illegal actions.
The former MP highlighted that internal wrangling and character assassination have long undermined peace and development in Agave.
It will be recalled that the Sogakope High Court recently issued an injunction against the installation and outdooring of a new Paramount Chief in the Agave Traditional Area, deeming the process illegal.
This followed a press release from the current Paramount Chief, Togbega Xedihor Hlitabo IV, who asserted that he remains the legally recognised chief and that any attempt to install a new one is unnecessary and destabilizing.
The injunction halts all actions toward installing a new chief.

Asenso Boakye denies sabotaging the AccraKumasi Expressway,"The Member of Parliament for Bantama, Francis Asenso-Boakye, has strongly refuted accusations from the Majority in Parliament that he is working to undermine the planned construction of the AccraKumasi Expressway by the John Mahama administration.
The Finance Minister, Dr
Cassiel Ato Forson
, during a parliamentary debate on Thursday, alleged that the Bantama MP had personally written to the President, asking for the cancellation of the project.
Dr Forson described the conduct of the MP as surprising and disappointing, arguing that a senior lawmaker from the Ashanti Region, which is expected to benefit from reduced travel time and increased business opportunities, should be championing such a major national infrastructure.
He questioned why an MP from a region that relies heavily on road transport for trade and industry would seek to stall a landmark development.
Speaking on Otec FMs morning show Nyansapo, hosted by Kwaku Owusu Boateng on Friday, November 28, 2025, Asenso-Boakye dismissed the allegations as false and a ploy to tarnish his and the Minoritys image.
He stressed that he did not campaign against the road project but rather offered constructive input on how best the project could be executed to serve the national interest.
The former Minister for Roads and Highways clarified that although he wrote to President
John Dramani Mahama
on the matter, he only advised that the government should complete the existing AccraKumasi dualisation project initiated under former President John Agyekum Kufuor.
It is better to continue a strategic and economically viable project that already has significant progress than to start a new, undefined and unfunded one, he argued.
He described the new initiative as misguided, insisting that abandoning a project that is already partially built would waste the countrys limited resources and delay the benefits the road is intended to deliver.
According to him, completing the ongoing works would significantly cut travel time by two hours, boosting commerce, tourism, and overall national productivity.
Asenso-Boakye noted that over 100 kilometres of the 240km stretch between Accra and Kumasi had already been dualised, with an additional 46 kilometres currently under active construction at locations including Anyinam, Osino, Enyiresi, and Konongo.
He added that only 94 kilometres remained to complete the project, stressing that starting a fresh project instead of finishing this one will be wasteful and imprudent.",,Regional, 28 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Asenso-Boakye-denies-sabotaging-the-Accra-Kumasi-Expressway-2011374

I never described the Accra-Kumasi Expressway as 'wasteful'  Asenso-Boakye clarifies,"Francis Asenso-Boakye, Member of Parliament for Bantama Constituency, has denied accusations of describing the AccraKumasi Expressway project as a ""waste.""
The former Minister of Roads clarified that he only suggested completing existing road projects on the highway instead of starting a new one.
Government had already committed funds into the expansion and dualization of the KumasiAccra Highway, so for the government to come up with a whole new project to construct an expressway without completing the earlier project is worrying,"" he said in an interview.
Speaking to Kwaku Owusu Boateng (KOB) on the Kumasi-based OTEC FMs morning show Nyansapo on Friday, Asenso-Boakye accused his colleagues from the other side of painting him black, saying the allegations are meant to undermine his reputation.
The Minister of Finance, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, had earlier accused Asenso-Boakye of opposing the governments planned AccraKumasi Expressway programme, claiming it would benefit his constituency.
Francis Asenso-Boakye has, however, called out the Majority for twisting his argument, urging the public to disregard the information.",,Regional, 28 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/I-never-described-the-Accra-Kumasi-Expressway-as-wasteful-Asenso-Boakye-clarifies-2011360
'Ken Agyapong is the hope for youth employment'  Robert Tetteyfio,"Correspondence from the Eastern Region
The
Kennedy Agyapong
campaign in the Krobo block of the Eastern Region is intensifying its mobilisation efforts ahead of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) presidential primary scheduled for January 2026.
Robert Adjase Tetteyfio, the coordinator for the campaign in the area, says delegates and youth groups are increasingly aligning themselves with the former Assin Central legislator due to his strong emphasis on job creation and economic empowerment.
Speaking during a community engagement tour with delegates, the former Head of Assets at the Office of the President under the Akufo Addo government stressed that
Kennedy Agyapong
s message resonates powerfully with young people across Yilo Krobo, Lower Manya Krobo, Upper Manya Krobo, and Asuogyaman where unemployment remains a major challenge.
You have to be close to someone like Ken Agyapong to know the qualities he possesses. We have decided to back him by preaching his message to the Krobo people because he always talks about jobs. Most youth in the Krobo block have completed school without securing employment. They need jobs, and Ken has assured us he will create them. If this happens, crime will also reduce, he explained.
He explained that although all aspirants in the upcoming primary are competent,
Kennedy Agyapong
stands out because of his practical track record in business and his hands-on commitment to job creation even outside political office.
Even now that he is not president, he is creating jobs, Adjase Tetteyfio noted, adding that He has invested in a steel factory, a cold store and a plastic factory, all of which employ large numbers of Ghanaian youth. This is the kind of leadership the country needs.""
According to him, Agyapongs engagements with international investors also position him as the candidate with the clearest plan for economic growth.
He said several investors have expressed readiness to commit significant resources into Ghanas economy if
Kennedy Agyapong
becomes president, describing it as a major opportunity for national development.
The campaign coordinator further argued that the youth view Agyapong as the hope of the country, adding that his leadership style, business experience and commitment to industrial expansion make him the best candidate to lead the NPP into the 2028 general elections.
He appealed to NPP delegates in the Krobo block and across the country to give
Kennedy Agyapong
the nod in January.
Party people should vote for him in the NPP presidential primary because he is the one Ghanaians want. We have tasked our team to ensure a clean campaign devoid of insults and attacks. We will focus on preaching Kens good works. The wind of change is blowing, and we are confident victory will be ours, he added.
Kennedy Agyapong
won the Upper Manya Krobo and Lower Manya Krobo constituencies in the last NPP presidential primary but narrowly lost in the Yilo Krobo constituency.
His team believes the renewed focus on job creation and community engagement will help secure a stronger result this time around.
Ken's campaign tour across the country is expected to continue in the weeks ahead as the January 2026 poll draws nearer.",,Regional, 28 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Ken-Agyapong-is-the-hope-for-youth-employment-Robert-Tetteyfio-2011357
"Dadwene community demands apology from police, military over wrongful arrests","Residents of Dadwene in the Ashanti Region are calling for an unqualified apology from the
Ghana Police Service
and the Ghana Armed Forces over the wrongful arrest of over 240 men from their community.
The men were among 300 persons arrested in a joint operation on November 12, 2025, targeting individuals involved in attacks on anti-illegal mining teams, police officers, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials.
However, community leaders claim their members were innocent and had no involvement in the attacks, describing the arrests as ""ill-informed"".
The Tafo District Court and Atasamanso Circuit Court granted bail to 240 men on November 27, 2025, after they spent two weeks in remand.
Kwabena Fosu, a community leader, criticised the security agencies for failing to conduct due diligence before the mass arrest.
""These are innocent men who had done nothing but were arrested and disgraced,"" he said.
""They were taken away from their families, with most of them having their businesses disrupted, causing a massive blow to the families. We believe the police must take responsibility for their actions"".
The community intends to pursue the matter further, seeking accountability for the security agencies' actions.",,Regional, 28 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Dadwene-community-demands-apology-from-police-military-over-wrongful-arrests-2011352
Frimpong Manso Institute urges restraint in SHS religious freedom debate,"Frimpong Manso Institute (FMI) has called for calm, balance and responsible public discourse amid the ongoing national debate on religious freedom and tolerance in senior high schools.
FMI said it is following with grave concern the raging debate on religious freedom and tolerance in our senior high schools, noting that while discussions are important, extreme positions risk inflaming tensions.
A statement issued and signed by Dr Affail Monney, a Fellow of the Media and Security Thematic Area of the Frimpong Manso Institute (FMI), on Thursday, November 27, 2025, cautioned all sides involved in the debate to tread carefully.
We caution the extreme flanks of the debate to be extra cautious in order not to stoke up religious tensions and derail the culture of peaceful coexistence among people of all faiths, the statement said.
The Frimpong Manso Institute (FMI) is following with grave concern the raging national debate on religious freedom and tolerance in our senior high schools.
We caution the extreme flanks of the debate to exercise the highest level of restraint so as not to stoke religious tensions or undermine the culture of peaceful coexistence that has long defined relations among people of all faiths in Ghana.
From time immemorial, religious tolerance has served as the bedrock of national unity and peace in our country. It is this same spirit of tolerance that must continue to hold us together rather than tear us apart.
We urge the media in particular to tone down divisive rhetoric and instead amplify messages that promote peace, understanding and constructive dialogue.
Indeed, the practice of solutions-oriented journalism is what all peace-loving and law-abiding Ghanaians expect from both traditional media practitioners and social media activists in these trying moments.
FMI further refers to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreed and adopted by government-assisted and private mission schools in 2024, particularly its emphasis on the need for mission schools to uphold a culture of tolerance, inclusivity and cooperation, even as they maintain the vision and mission of their respective religious bodies.
This framework, we believe, provides a workable middle ground for resolving any emerging conflicts and restoring the nation firmly onto the path of inter-faith harmony, durable peace and unshakable national unity.",,Regional, 28 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Frimpong-Manso-Institute-urges-restraint-in-SHS-religious-freedom-debate-2011351
Akatsi South hails ECGs Cephas Abotsi Yorm for exceptional service,"The representatives of communities of Akatsi South are resounding with praise for Cephas Abotsi, affectionately known as Yorm, a dedicated technician with the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) in Akatsi South.
Yorm has become a hero, widely celebrated for his unrelenting commitment to ensuring continuous power supply, often responding to emergencies at all hours, drawing commendation from community leaders, including the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE).
The outpouring of appreciation gained significant momentum after Japhet Festus Gbede, Assemblymember for Wuxor, Have, and Sremanu Electoral Area, shared a heartfelt tribute on Facebook.
His post, which quickly went viral, garnered over 2,000 likes, comments, and shares, with residents hailing Yorm as a silent hero, a national asset, and a rare gem in public service.
Notably, Daniel Dagba also joined the chorus of praise in the comments, further amplifying the communitys sentiment.
Among the numerous glowing remarks, one user wrote, ""Your name Yorm reflects your work. Keep it up,"" while another added, ""He always responds to calls.""
Many expressed sentiments like ""Yorm is a gem"" and ""He deserves double promotion,"" highlighting the deep respect he has earned.
Gbede recounted a recent incident where electricity in his village flickered and went off around 9:30 PM.
He contacted Yorm, who promptly drove from his location and restored power within 25 minutes. This is not the first time, Gbede emphasized.
Yorm has been doing this selflessly across the entire constituency. His dedication, humility, and passion for serving our people are unmatched.
The assemblymember stressed that Yorm doesn't just love his job; he lives it, responding to calls day or night to prevent communities from being plunged into darkness.
His consistent hard work and profound commitment have become an inspiration, setting a benchmark for public service across the country.
Recognizing Yorms extraordinary contributions, Gbede has appealed to the Planning Committee of the Avenor Tutu Do Festival to establish a special award category for deserving individuals like him.
He further advocated for Yorms recognition to extend beyond local accolades, urging for national and international acknowledgment.
Echoing these sentiments, the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Akatsi South has also acknowledged Yorms exceptional service, indicating support for broader recognition.
People like Yorm keep our communities moving forward. He is an inspiration to all of us, the MCE stated, reinforcing the call for his exemplary work to be celebrated.

Asanko Gold engages communities with new farming assistance project,"Over 1,000 farmers are being targeted for modern and climate-smart practices training, with direct input support provided to 250 farmers under the Community Agricultural Support Project (CASP), an initiative spearheaded by Asanko Gold Ghana Limited for its host communities.
The initiative aims to improve yields through better-quality inputs, strengthen technical capacity through farmer training, promote climate-smart and sustainable farming practices, support stronger farmer groups and access to credit, and encourage youth involvement in modern agriculture and agribusiness.
The program will also link 500 farmers to cooperatives and credit schemes, engage 500 youth in agribusiness opportunities including beekeeping, mushroom production, fish farming and piggery, strengthen farmer groups for improved coordination and market access, and ensure effective delivery through joint monitoring by Asanko and the District Agriculture Departments.
According to the management of Asanko Gold Ghana Limited, the initiative goes beyond distributing inputs.
It is a deliberate effort to help families stabilize and strengthen their livelihoods in a changing economic environment.
Agriculture remains a major source of support for families across Asankos host communities and the Amansie areas, but rising input costs, limited access to tools and gaps in technical support have made effective farming increasingly difficult.
These challenges resulted in the birth of the Community Agricultural Support Project, a targeted initiative designed to respond to real needs and strengthen household resilience.
Speaking at the launch of CASP, General Manager for Asanko Gold Ghana Limited, Ahmed Mohadini-Yahaya, explained that the initiative, which falls under the companys five-year development program, will help change the perception that people in the Amansie areas are focused solely on mining and not farming.
He stressed that the land cannot be left to illegal mining, hence the need to support farmers to increase yields for a ready marketwhere Asanko Gold Ghana Limited will purchase the produce to feed its staff members.
He added, We want to change the narrative from the illegal mining that we have in these communities to more productive and farming organized structures.
He further appealed to chiefs and opinion leaders to support farmers and intensify education to help them appreciate the importance of farming over illegal mining.
Amansie South District Crop Officer, Benjamin Benim, described the initiative as a game-changer, noting that it will reduce the cost burden on farmers in acquiring basic farm tools in the long term.
Asanko Gold Ghana is also ready to buy the produce from the farmers. So they will buy all the cassava and also help the farmers to add value to the produce to improve their livelihoods. So Asanko is doing a wonderful work for the farmers, he said.
Beneficiary farmers lauded the initiative and commended Asanko Gold Ghana Limited for the support.
One of the farmers, Frimpong from Manso-Krofrom, said, This is not the first time Asanko is supporting us. The company has been consistent in supporting farmers within its host communities and we are forever grateful.
According to management, these initiatives reflect the companys long-term commitment to supporting wellbeing, strengthening local capacity and promoting shared progress.", Adbul-Samed,Regional, 27 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Asanko-Gold-engages-communities-with-new-farming-assistance-project-2011272
Only 1.2 million Ghanaians pay their taxes - Report,"Only 1.2 million Ghanaians pay their taxes, Cephas Makafui Zokah, a Compliance Officer at the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), has said.
He attributed the problem partly to low public education and the hesitancy of many taxpayers to honour their tax obligation, stating that the GRA is presently undertaking a nationwide tax sensitisation campaign.
Zokah said the campaign sought to sensitise the masses, especially informal sector workers, about the need for them to pay their taxes and to widen the nations tax net.
He was speaking at a sensitisation forum on tax organised by the GRA for some artisanal workers in Sunyani, attended by electricians, carpenters, plumbers, hairdressers, traders, masons, tailors and apprentices drawn from Berekum and Sunyani Municipalities in the Bono Region.
Zokah also introduced and enlightened the participants on its Modified Taxation Scheme (MTS), an online tax-paying system, took them through the registration process and urged them to use the platform to pay their taxes.
He explained that the MTS was designed to help businesses in the informal sector to register with GRA, pay their required taxes conveniently and also file their tax returns.
Zokah said: The MTS will grow the tax revenue, increase tax compliance amongst targeted groups, enhance fairness and equity in the tax system as well as reduce administrative pressures.
Festus Onomah-Quansah, the Sunyani Area Director of the GRA, said the MTS application was flexible and enabled taxpayers to easily pay their taxes.
He said tax collection and payment of taxes remained the responsibility of everybody, and urged especially informal sector workers to remain patriotic and loyal and voluntarily pay their taxes.",,Regional, 27 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Only-1-2-million-Ghanaians-pay-their-taxes-Report-2011246
Chieftaincy Showdown: Agave leaders drag Woyome brothers to President Mahama,"The Divisional Wing Chiefs and people of the Agave Traditional Area in the South Tongu District of the Volta Region have accused the Woyome brothers, Alfred Agbesi Woyome and Kwabla Mensah Woyome, of unlawfully interfering in the traditional affairs of the area.
The traditional authorities, including Wing Chiefs, Divisional Chiefs, Sub-Chiefs, Queen Mothers, and others, staged a protest on November 24, 2025, during which they petitioned President John Dramani Mahama.
They requested that his office halt what they describe as systematic and unlawful interference by the Woyome brothers in Agave chieftaincy affairs.
According to them, the actions of the Woyome brothers constitute a direct assault on their customs and laws, adding that the brothers are unqualified to assume any role in the districts chieftaincy matters.
""We stand united in our demand for immediate intervention to halt the systematic and unlawful interference in Agave chieftaincy affairs by the Woyome brothers and their associates. Their actions constitute a direct assault on our customs, our laws, and the very fabric of our traditional governance. The gravity of this situation cannot be overstated.
""...The Woyome brothers do not fit the traditional priestly role in Agave; by our customs and laws, they are considered outsiders. Despite this, the brothers have used their previous positions, one as a former consul for Ghana and the other as a former Member of Parliament for South Tongu, to involve themselves in chieftaincy matters. These matters are not their concern,"" the petition reads.
The petitioners further alleged that the Woyome brothers, together with the Regional House of Chiefs, have installed and gazetted a self-styled paramount chief in Agave using his private name, something they consider alien to their traditions.
According to them, the Regional House of Chiefs crowned Edward Allan Agbeti as the traditional ruler despite being served with an interlocutory injunction.
""The Woyome brothers, along with Tepre Hodo of the Regional House of Chiefs, have installed and gazetted a self-styled paramount chief in Agave using the private name Edward Allan Agbeti, which is completely alien to the stool.""
Ghana's chieftaincy institution at risk - Kwahu Forum for Truth
They are requesting that President John Dramani Mahama grant them 10 reliefs, among which is an order directing the Woyome brothers to immediately hand over the traditional council keys and instructing the Regional House of Chiefs to operationalise the traditional council.
They are also demanding that Alfred Abesi Woyome, one of the Woyome brothers, be interrogated alongside the Wing Chiefs of Agave.
""Stop the Woyome brothers from using their residence as a palace for the outdooring of chiefs. Furthermore, the Attorney General should release the docket for the investigation and prosecution of Prince Kofi Adiabo (also known as Edward Agbeti), the illegitimate paramount chief installed by the Woyome brothers and fraudulently gazetted with the help of Tepre Hodo, to proceed.
""Ensure the revocation of the fraudulent gazette of Prince Kofi Adiabo and investigate the Regional House of Chiefs on how they got him gazetted. Ensure the proper investigation and prosecution of Holy Kofi Ahiabu for his role in inciting violence and making threats against the legitimate chiefs,"" it added.

Odumase-Krobo Nursing and Midwifery College celebrates 10 years,"The OdumaseKrobo Nursing and Midwifery Training College (NMTC) in the Eastern Region on Saturday, November 22, 2025, marked its 10th anniversary with a colourful celebration that brought together traditional leaders, government officials, health sector stakeholders, faculty, alumni, and students to reflect on a decade of progress and chart a bold future for preventive health education in Ghana.
Held on the college premises at Odumase-Krobo under the theme, ""A decade of quality preventive health education; challenges and emerging agenda,"" the event highlighted the institutions rapid growth, its challenges, and a renewed national call for well-trained, community-centred health professionals.
Addressing the gathering, the Principal, Dr Jones Abekah Baah, expressed pride in the colleges achievements but underscored persistent challenges.
Poor access roads, infrastructure deficits, and limited staff housing, he noted, continue to impede growth. But the institution, he said, has not only survived it has thrived, crediting the resilience of staff and students.
In a major announcement, Dr Baah revealed that the college had recently secured institutional accreditation from the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC), paving the way for new diploma programmes in Midwifery and Public Health Nursing beginning in the next academic year.
This marks a significant milestone in expanding the colleges mandate beyond the certificate in the Nurse Assistant Preventive programme.
Addressing new students, he urged discipline, commitment, and academic excellence.
Matriculation is not just a ceremony; it is a covenant of dedication and service, he reminded them.
To the graduating class, he offered a powerful charge: Your uniform represents more than attireit is an emblem of sacrifice and responsibility. Let excellence be your signature.
Paramount Chief of the Manya Krobo Traditional Area, Nene Sakite II, urged graduating students to embrace compassion, professionalism, and lifelong learning as they step into national service.
You, the graduating class, are accomplished to take on the world, he said.
Youve reached the culmination of hard work, late-night dedication, and resilience. Be proud of your achievements. This is a call to actionbe advocates, educators, collaborators, and pillars of your community. Embrace challenges with humour and resilience, and create a healthier, more equitable future for all.
He further emphasised the collaborative effort that birthed the school, noting, It took a lot of hard work, courage, and dedication for this nursing school to be here today. The Krobo area has many health facilities, including a public health university. This nursing school can take advantage of these to become
second to none.
Guest of honour at the ceremony and Eastern Regional Minister, Rita Akosua Adjei Awatey, delivering the keynote address, reaffirmed the governments commitment to strengthening health training institutions as part of the Mahama Care initiativean ambitious reform agenda aimed at expanding access to equitable and affordable healthcare countrywide.
Healthcare is a right, not a privilege, she said.
But Mahama Care cannot succeed without a well-trained and motivated health workforce. Institutions like NMTC Odumase-Krobo are at the frontline of achieving Universal Health Coverage.
She outlined ongoing plans to modernise simulation laboratories, expand accommodation, and enhance clinical training partnerships.
The Minister also assured the college of support in addressing its pressing needs, including the absence of a school bus, inadequate lecture halls, and a lack of staff accommodation.
Co-founder of the college and former Volta Regional Health Director, Dr Joseph Nuertey, recounted the vision behind the institutions establishment.
He emphasised ongoing efforts to secure more hostels, protect school lands, and ensure the smooth takeoff of the new midwifery programme.
The vision isnt dead, he assured.
Whatever I must do to ensure that the midwifery programme starts next academic year, Ill do it.
The celebration also honored the Augustine Kwao Owusu family, whose land donation made the schools establishment possible.
Over the decade, the college has produced hundreds of health professionals who now serve across the country, contributing significantly to community health and national development.
As NMTC Odumase-Krobo enters its second decade, leaders, staff, and partners pledged to expand opportunities, strengthen preventive health training, and position the college as a national Centre of Excellence.
The message was unanimous: the next decade begins with renewed hope, collaboration, and a commitment to shaping compassionate, skilled health workers for Ghana and beyond.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 26 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Odumase-Krobo-Nursing-and-Midwifery-College-celebrates-10-years-2011157
MCE hands over abandoned 4-bedroom bungalow started under President Mahama,"The Municipal Chief Executive for Akatsi South, Daniel Dagba, has officially handed over a newly completed four-bedroom Medical Consultant Bungalow at the Akatsi South Municipal Hospital, a project he says was abandoned for eight years under the previous administration.
According to the MCE, the facility, constructed by Gabus Construction Ltd., forms part of a series of legacy projects initiated in 2016 during the first term of former President John Dramani Mahama but left to rot after the change of government in 2017.
Dagba expressed satisfaction that the long-stalled project has finally been completed to serve its intended purpose.
This project represents a vital step toward improving healthcare delivery in our municipality. It will be occupied by esteemed healthcare providers whose work is essential to saving lives, he noted.
He disclosed that the completion of the bungalow is one of several abandoned projects he inherited upon assuming office and has since pushed to bring to completion as part of efforts to enhance health infrastructure in the area.

Auditor General clears MIIF's 2024 accounts which records GH1.96 billion income,"The Minerals Income Investment Fund (MIIF) in 2024, under Edward Nana Yaw Koranteng, posted its strongest results since its inception, recording GH1.964 billion in net income, almost 300% higher than the previous years GH455 million.
This is contained in the Funds audited financial statements signed by the current CEO of MIIF, Justina Nelson, and the MIIF board chairman on 26th June 2025.
A review of the audited financials found that the Auditor described MIIF as a high-performing sovereign minerals fund with strengthened revenue streams, investment growth, and balance sheet resilience.
Total assets of the Fund, as reviewed, rose to GH11.2 billion, while the Fund maintained a cost-to-income ratio of just 3%, far below global sovereign wealth fund standards and those of all state-owned institutions in Ghana.
General and Administrative expenses amounted to GH59.7 million, representing only 3% of total income. Travel expenditure, which falls under G&A, remained below 0.4% of revenue, according to the report.
A check on operational issues revealed that all travel by management, staff, and board was authorised by the Chief of Staff and aligned with Board-approved mandates and the approved budget, contrary to recent assertions in some media.
Further checks on expenses revealed board fees and sitting allowances of circa GH800,000 in 2023 and GH2 million in 2024, covering all six committees, including the investment advisory committee. Further checks showed that board fees are set by the Ministry of Finance and paid in line with the ministries guidelines.
Record profit
MIIF also posted a record profit of GH1.904 billion, reflecting a 97% margin, making it arguably the most profitable state institution. Cash reserves reached a record GH5.58 billion, a 69% increase from 2023, thereby strengthening the Fund's liquidity.
Fund investment portfolio
The Funds investment portfolio, including gold, lithium, and industrial salt, is positioned to deliver diversified long-term value. MIIFs US$40 million investment in Asante Gold Corporation, which owns the Mensin Bibiani, Chirano, and the Kubi, for instance, as at 1st November 2025, yielded circa US$20 million (GH224 million).
MIIFs investment in Atlantic Lithium of Australia, a holding company, makes it the third-largest shareholder globally. MIIFs investment in the Ada Songhor salt enclave, leased to Electrochem Ghana, positions Ada as the largest industrial salt-producing enclave in sub-Saharan Africa, with the potential to produce over 1 million tons of salt.
The MIIF gold trade
The Gold Trade Program generated more than US$1.0 billion in receipts and GH36 million in profit for 2024 as recorded in the audited financials. MIIFs capital outlay in its trade program was the cedi equivalent of US$30 million, from which it realised over US$250 million.
Fidelity Bank and CBOD participated in the MIIF gold trade (gold for forex) with their own funds (pre-finance).
Fidelity received US$197 million through the program, while CBOD received over US$700 million to complement the government's gold-for-oil initiative.
Despite cumulative forex losses affecting all parties, Fidelity's $19 million forex loss was resolved without recourse to MIIFs deposits, on the back of an approved Ministry of Finance and Board trade expansion and forex loss recovery strategy.
It is important to note that MIIF, under the current CEO, Justina Nelson, issued a Civil Writ against Goldridge and one of the trade insurance companies for loss recovery of approximately US$27 million on 3rd October 2025.

Eduamoah reaffirms commitment to youth employment and entrepreneurship,"As part of efforts to raise the development profile of the Central Region through discipline, unity, and strategic investments, the Central Regional Minister, Ekow Panyin Okyere Eduamoah, has outlined an ambitious plan to transform the region into a hub of industrial growth, educational excellence, and sustainable tourism.
In an exclusive interview, the Minister shed light on the pressing challenges confronting the region and the well-structured roadmap his administration is deploying to address them.
He emphasised that he possesses the experience, vision, and resolve needed to lead the Central Region into its next phase of transformation, anchored in discipline, coordination, and shared responsibility.
Known for his calm but decisive leadership, Eduamoah carries the weight of regional expectations with humility and precision.
His vision for the region is guided by progress, people, and purpose.
Despite its historic and educational significance, he noted, the Central Region faces a number of socio-economic challenges that continue to impact livelihoods.
Youth unemployment, inadequate road infrastructure, and declining sanitation standards remain among the most urgent issues.
The challenge, he stressed, is not a lack of potential but a history of inconsistent implementation, something the current administration is determined to change.
He further explained that although the regions economy is anchored by education and tourism, it has been slow to diversify.
Many rural communities continue to struggle with limited access to potable water, poor healthcare infrastructure, and underdeveloped markets for agriculture and fisheries.
Urban centers such as Cape Coast and Elmina also face mounting pressure from unplanned settlements and waste management deficiencies, threatening the sustainability of the regions coastal environment.
To confront these challenges, Eduamoah outlined a four-pillar strategy aimed at revitalising the regions socio-economic architecture.
We are aggressively rehabilitating feeder roads and enhancing urban road networks to improve trade and accessibility. Every district must feel the pulse of development, he stated.
He revealed that ongoing partnerships with private investors and government agencies aim to establish small-scale agro-processing zones and industrial parks across the region.
Our focus is not just job creation, but job sustainability. Were investing in skills and entrepreneurship for the youth.
Recognizing the region as the cradle of Ghanas tourism heritage, the Minister also highlighted initiatives to modernize tourist sites and improve hospitality standards.
Tourism is our goldmine. We are rebranding Cape Coast and Elmina as global heritage destinations.
He reaffirmed the governments commitment to strengthening the regions educational sector, noting that the Central Region, home to some of Ghanas most prestigious institutions, continues to prioritise quality education.
Plans, he said, are underway to refurbish schools, promote technical and vocational training, and support teacher motivation.
Education remains our competitive advantage. It is the strongest tool to secure our future, he said.
With unwavering optimism, Eduamoah described his tenure as one defined by collaboration, transparency, and tangible impact.
This administration believes in inclusive leadership, and development cannot succeed without the involvement of our chiefs, youth, women, and private sector actors.
The Central Regions destiny is in our hands. Let us rise together, work together, and prosper together. This is the new dawn of progress for the Central Region.", Nii Okpoti Odamtten,Regional, 26 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Eduamoah-reaffirms-commitment-to-youth-employment-and-entrepreneurship-2011133
