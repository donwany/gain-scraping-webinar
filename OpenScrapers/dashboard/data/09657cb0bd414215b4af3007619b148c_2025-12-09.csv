Let's treat persons with disability right  Director urges GHS staff,"Dr Caroline Reindorf Amissah, the Acting Deputy Director-General,
Ghana Health Service
(GHS), has advised staff of the
Ghana Health Service
to treat all clients right, with particular attention to persons with disability (PWDs).
She said there were attitudinal barriers among health workers regarding persons with disability, a situation which was wrong and needed to be worked on.
So, sometimes as health workers, we are the major culprits. We know the challenges. We are even well aware that these challenges among persons with disability are health challenges, but we are the same people that would not treat them the way that we are preaching to other people to recognise.
So, I think it is some of these negative perceptions that go far to increase or deepen the stigma that these people face or the challenges they face when they try to access healthcare, she noted.
Dr Amissah gave the advice at the commemoration of the International Day of Persons with Disability by the GHS, in partnership with the Ghana Federation of Disability Organisations, the National Council on PWDs, the World Health Organization and Sightsavers, on the theme: Building Inclusive Health Service Delivery for Social Progress.
She reiterated: Some of the barriers are our favourite  stigma and discrimination  so we refuse to acknowledge or accept persons with disabilities as part of us.
We tend to discriminate against them. When we have a crowd of patients and we want to try and see who should be seen first, I doubt disability is on our mind. We do not look there at all, she said.
The 2023 Disability Inclusive Health Landscape Review conducted by the Health Promotion Division of the Service, she said, highlighted some major barriers faced by PWDs, such as knowledge barriers  thus limited understanding of persons with disability among health staff  and lack of sign language interpreters in health facilities.
Moreover, there are financing barriers which make it difficult for PWDs to access assistive facilities.
Dr Amissah noted that the GHS had, however, developed guidelines to remove the physical, communication and attitudinal barriers to ensure that no Ghanaian was denied or discouraged from accessing health services because of his or her disability.
We have also tried to build some capacity for our staff. I must say that we have trained some frontline staff, but to me this is woefully inadequate, and we need to do more.
We have launched an e-learning course on disability inclusion, but there still remain some gaps because people do not see the importance of it.
They do not attach that importance to it. So, probably the courses are there, but people are not registering and signing on to these programmes, she lamented.
The Acting Deputy Director-General called for a budget line for disability inclusion within the Service to ensure that there were funds to support disability inclusion.
Disability inclusion, for me, is not a charity at all. We are not having mercy on anybody. We could all be disabled at any point in our lives, she added.
Dorcas Efe Mensah, a Disability Inclusion Advisor, GFD, in a speech delivered on her behalf, said health was a right and not a privilege; therefore, this years theme reminded all that the strength of the nations health system was measured not by how it served the majority, but by how it embraced those who had long been excluded.
And more importantly, we realise that in disaster scenarios, we find a number of cases that need urgent responses, but by leveraging solutions for persons with disabilities in such times of crisis, we are able to deliver at a faster and more efficient rate to ensure that no one is left behind, she added.
To single out a few of the key interventions, the disability desks and sign language integration into the nursing training institutions, she said, were more relevant due to the fact that technology failure would certainly be met with well-equipped health professionals who were able to assist in real time and prevent delay while ensuring improved efficiency to eventually save lives.
Edwin Kweku Andoh, the Executive Secretary, National Council on PWDs, said key challenges included limited accessibility in some healthcare facilities, exclusion from health policy decision-making processes, stigma and discrimination against persons with disabilities, and insufficient training for healthcare professionals on these key challenges.
He appealed for disability-inclusive health guidelines and service delivery to be strengthened and for the capacity building of staff to be enhanced on disability-inclusive care.",,Health,  7 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Let-s-treat-persons-with-disability-right-Director-urges-GHS-staff-2012542
AHF expands Global HIV programme to Ghana,"The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), the worlds largest HIV/AIDS care organisation, has announced the expansion of its global public health services to Ghana.
Dr Penninah Iutung, the Executive Vice President of the Foundation, said this at a media briefing on the sidelines of the ongoing International Conference on AIDS and STIs (ICASA ) in Accra.
She said AHF officials were already in talks with the Ministry of Health, as their Ghana programme would be built primarily through partnerships with the government, beginning with a formal Memorandum of Understanding currently under legal review.
Our entry point is always the government; this gives us the opportunity to align with national HIV priorities and strengthen existing healthcare structures, she said.
Dr Iutung said the AHF was known for rapid deployment and urgent care, saying, HIV is a matter of life and death; people can live long, healthy lives now, so we dont delay. Our value is in our speed and how fast we respond.
She said that while AHFs main model was facility-based support, the foundation may adapt community outreach strategies such as youth and key population-focused approaches in Ghana.
Dr Iutung said AHFs roots could be traced to the early days of the HIV epidemic, when no treatment was available, and patients required significant post-hospitalisation care.
With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the 1990s, AHF was formed to deliver lifesaving treatment to people living with HIV.
She said 24 years ago, AHF began scaling globally, launching its first ART programmes in South Africa and later Uganda.
It presently operates in 50 countries and provides care to more than 2.7 million people.
Ambassador Angelina Wapakabulo, Vice Global Chair and a founding member of AHF, said the foundations Uganda Cares programme, a community clinic model set up inside some of Ugandas busiest markets, has been one of AHFs most impactful innovations.
In the early 2000s, many organisations rejected the idea of providing HIV services in informal market spaces.
People said it was impossible, markets are chaotic, vendors calling customers, no formal structures. But AHF said, This is exactly where we are needed, she said.
Madam Wapakabulo said the approach   of establishing clinics inside markets has, over the years, allowed women vendors to access HIV testing, treatment, TB care, and STI services without leaving their
stalls.
Today, the market clinic takes care of over 10,000 patients. It addresses stigma and removes access barriers for communities that cannot spend hours in hospital queues, she said.
AHF: The Worlds Largest HIV Organization, Driven by Local Leadership
Dr. Jorge Saavedra, Executive Director of AHFs Global Public Health Institute, underscored AHFs commitment to local ownership of its country programs.
He said AHFs expansion beyond HIV is driven partly by lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and global inequities in access to vaccines and therapeutics.
He said the foundations decision to expand into Ghana was inspired by President John Dramani Mahamas strong advocacy for increased investment in public health.
Developing countries must understand that health spending is not a cost, it is an investment, Dr. Saavedra said. Adding We see Ghanas vision and want to support it.
He praised the African Unions model of continental health cooperation through the Africa CDC, describing it as a model that other regions can replicate.
The International Conference of HIV and STIs in Africa is the largest continental gathering on HIV/AIDS, STIs, TB, Malaria, and health system strengthening in Africa.
The 23rd edition is presently underway in Accra, from Dec 3-8, on the theme: ""Africa in Action: Catalysing Integrated Sustainable Responses to End AIDS, TB & Malaria.

Family Health University graduates 318 healthcare professionals,"Family Health University (FHU) has held its December 2025 graduation ceremony at the forecourt of the university in Accra, celebrating the achievements of 318 new healthcare professionals from its Medical School and School of Nursing and Midwifery.
The event was held under the theme Building Bridges and Raising Ladders for the Next Generation of Healthcare Providers.
Delivering the keynote address, Professor Enyonam Yao Kwawukume, Founder and Vice Chancellor of Family Health University/Hospital, applauded the graduates for their resilience, discipline, and commitment to excellence.
A total of 73 medical students graduated, with 30 receiving the Bachelor of Science in Medical Sciences for completing their pre-clinical studies and progressing to the clinical phase of their training.
The remaining 43 medical candidates completed their clinical requirements and now qualify for the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) degree.
Prof Kwawukume noted that these young doctors are poised to contribute meaningfully to Ghanas pursuit of accessible and quality healthcare.
The School of Nursing and Midwifery presented 245 graduates, including 111 Bachelor of Science in Nursing, 64 Bachelor of Science in Midwifery, and 70 Nurse Assistant Clinical graduates.
He commended them for embracing a profession that demands not only knowledge and skill, but empathy, compassion, and dedication to service.
The vice chancellor highlighted the universitys steady growth, including the recruitment of competent faculty, expansion of lecture halls, the acquisition of additional vehicles for clinical rotations, and ongoing construction of student hostels, office spaces, and more learning facilities.
He emphasised the importance of international partnerships in strengthening research and academic exchange.
FHUs longstanding collaboration with the University of Virginia (UVA) continues to yield results, with the two institutions jointly researching adolescent sexual and reproductive health in the Greater Accra and Volta Regions.
As part of its exchange programme, FHU recently hosted 10 students and 3 faculty members from UVA, who joined FHU nursing students in Community Needs Assessment exercises in Old Ningo, focusing on continuity of care under the Expanded Programme on Immunisation.
Partnerships with the University of Michigan, including the Schweitzer Mich-Ghana Student Research Grant, were also highlighted for supporting maternal and child health research among FHU students.
Prof Kwawukume reaffirmed the universitys mission to train competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals capable of addressing real health challenges.
He called on stakeholders to continue supporting the institutions growth and community impact.
Guest of Honour, Air Commodore D A Akrong, Acting Commandant of the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC), praised the graduates for their dedication and encouraged them to uphold the highest standards of service.
He reminded them that healthcare professionals serve as bridges between pain and healing, despair and hope, and urged them to lift others as they progress.

Why MoFFA has partially closed down some mortuaries in the Eastern Region,"Several mortuaries in the Eastern Region have been partially closed after failing to meet basic sanitation and safety standards, the Mortuary and Funeral Facilities Agency (MoFFA) has announced.
The update was shared on the Ministry of Healths Facebook page on Thursday, December 4, 2025.
According to the statement, The Mortuary and Funeral Facilities Agency (MoFFA) has begun a two-day enforcement exercise in the Eastern Region, targeting mortuaries operating without licences and those falling short of basic environmental and safety standards.
""The operation, which forms part of efforts to safeguard public health and the dignity of the deceased, has already led to the partial closure of several facilities.
Deaths have increased since nurses' strike began' - Mortuary Workers
The affected mortuaries include the Suhum Government Hospital Mortuary, Adom Funeral Home Mortuary, Great Consolidated Diamonds Ghana Limited (GCDGL), and the Kwahu Government Hospital Mortuary.
Others are the Agyakwa Hospital Limited Mortuary in Nkawkaw and CHAD Medical Services Mortuary in Osino.
The post further noted that Francis Ennin, Registrar of MoFFA, said the affected facilities had been given two months to rectify their shortcomings but failed to comply.
He explained that inspections focus on waste disposal, water and power supply, sanitation, PPE availability, and the proper arrangement of bodies, all aimed at protecting public health and preserving the dignity of the deceased.
We are here to ensure compliance and safeguard the welfare of Ghanaians, he emphasised, warning that all non-compliant facilities would be surcharged and monitored closely.
The exercise will continue until all operators do the right thing. We also urge mortuary owners to register with the Agency, it stated.
Public, private mortuaries to be closed down on Thursday as mortuary workers begin strike
MoFFA was established under the Health Institutions and Facilities Act 829, and is responsible for regulating, licensing, and monitoring all establishments involved in the storage, transportation, and disposal of human remains.

Ghana charges African countries to unite to end AIDS by 2030,"Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyeman, the Vice President, has charged African countries to bring to the fore unity, consistency, and the courage to prioritize sustainable solutions over short-term fixes to ensure the continent ends AIDS by 2030.
The next five years are the critical moment that will determine whether we can reach the 2030 target of ending AIDS as a public health threat. We know that this is Africas decisive moment. We possess the science, the knowledge,  the leadership, and the resilience.
What we need to bring to the fore are unity, consistency, and the courage to prioritize sustainable solutions over short-term fixes.
Let us advance our focus on discipline, scaling integrated sustainable responses that can end AIDS, TB, and malaria. And position Africa for long-term health resilience, she said.
The Vice President made the call at the opening of the 23rd International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA 2025) held in Accra on Wednesday.
The conference, which begins on 3-8 December, is organised by the Society for AIDS in Africa (SAA) on the theme, Africa in Action: Catalysing Integrated and Resilient Health Systems for Sustainable Responses to end HIV, Other Infectious Diseases, and Emerging Threats.
She said health emergencies were testing health systems, thus the space for global solidarity, though still important, was narrowing, adding that, in such a moment, Africa must step forward with vision and leadership.
We must hold our agenda, define our priorities, and build strong, sustainable, self-reliant systems across the world. We have witnessed remarkable progress in reducing new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths with Antiretroviral therapy saving millions of lives, the Vice President stated.
She said innovations such as HIV self-testing and long-acting injectables were driving prevention, yet the pandemic persists, and progress was uneven in Africa, facing profound disparities in access and outcomes.
According to the Vice President, while the 95-95-95 targets were within reach for many nations, others remained far behind.
In Ghana, however, around 65 per cent of people living with HIV know their status and many are receiving lifesaving treatments.
New infections have steadily declined, and community-led organizations remain the backbone of the countrys response, she said.
These notwithstanding, Africa demands sustained political, financial, and social policy as young people, especially adolescent girls and young women, account for a disproportionate share of new infections.
She said as stigma and discrimination remained barriers to testing, disclosure, and adherence, with global support shrinking, Africa must refuse to let her hard-earned
This is our chance to be bold, to rethink, redesign, and rebuild a sustainable financial foundation for the next generation of health security, she added.
The Vice President said to end AIDS by 2030, Africa must lead their own response. We must strengthen domestic finance, build regional pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, enhance disease surveillance and laboratory systems, and empower communities and civil society organizations.
Our national approach is anchored in our broader research agenda. This is a long-term strategy to build a self-sustaining, technology-driven, data-enabled and equitable health system.
She called for sustainable and credible financing and strengthening universal health coverage as the government had unpacked the end-AIDS to expand fiscal space for essential health services.
She said it was as a result of this that the government, through the Ghana Medical Care Trust Fund, would provide support for citizens living with chronic and lifelong conditions.
This initiative, to be launched in January 2026, would guarantee access to essential services for every community, decentralizing care and removing financial barriers, Local pharmaceutical manufacturing, the Veep stated.
Dr David Pagwesese Parirenyatwa, the President of SAA and ICASA 2025, commended Ghana for its hospitality and hosting this years conference.
Speaking on the importance of the conference, he said ICASA was by Africans for Africa and charged countries to commit domestic funding to end AIDS by 20230 on the continent.
ICASA is a major, bilingual AIDS conference held exclusively in Africa, alternating biannually between Anglophone and Francophone countries.
For over 30 years, ICASA has been instrumental in mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis, and Malaria, while promoting an inclusive environment free from stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV (PLHIV) and their families.",,Health,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ghana-charges-African-countries-to-unite-to-end-AIDS-by-2030-2012347
Ashanti Regional Director of Health educates public on PrEP,"Dr Fred Adomako-Boateng, Ashanti Regional Director of Health Services, has urged the public to take advantage of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a highly effective HIV prevention method that many people are still unaware of.
PrEP is a medication that can be taken to prevent HIV transmission from a partner living with HIV and AIDS to a negative partner during sexual intercourse.
It significantly lowers ones risk of contracting HIV and is a highly effective prevention method, reducing the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99 per cent when used as prescribed.
Speaking during a media briefing in Kumasi to mark World AIDS Day, Dr Adomako-Boateng stressed that while HIV prevention efforts had traditionally focused on abstinence, condom use, and treatment, PrEP had emerged as an additional tool that could significantly reduce new infections.
Many people do not know that PrEP exists, and even fewer know that it is available for free in several health facilities across the Ashanti region, he said.
He explained that PrEP was especially useful for people at higher risk of HIV exposure, including young men and women, discordant coupleswhere one partner is HIV positive and the other negative, key populations, and anyone who feels vulnerable.
According to him, HIV prevention had evolved, and PrEP was safe, simple, and highly effective.
Dr Adomako-Boateng highlighted the urgency of expanding prevention awareness due to the regions HIV treatment gap.
Although the Ashanti region has seen a 28.2 per cent rise in the number of clients on treatment, only 52.9 per cent of people estimated to be living with HIV are currently receiving care.
This means thousands of people either do not know their status or are not yet on medication.
To close this gap, we must strengthen both testing and prevention
and PrEP is one of the surest ways to avoid infection altogether, he stated.
He encouraged the public, especially youth and men, who often test late, to access free and confidential testing services.
Knowing ones status, he said, remained the first step in taking control of ones health, whether through early treatment or preventive options like PrEP.
Dr Adomako-Boateng also called for an end to stigma and discrimination, which continued to hinder people from testing and seeking care.
HIV is a health condition, not a moral failure, he noted, stressing that people living with HIV deserved love, respect, and dignity.
The Regional Health Directorate, he said, would continue to collaborate with traditional leaders, assembly members, faith-based groups, schools, youth organisations, and the media to increase awareness about PrEP and other HIV services.",,Health,  4 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ashanti-Regional-Director-of-Health-educates-public-on-PrEP-2012260
Low HIV testing rates threaten progress toward 95-95-95 targets - GAC warns,"The Acting Director-General of the Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC), Dr Prosper Akanbong, has raised concerns about Ghanas slow progress toward achieving the global 95-95-95 HIV targets.
Dr Akambo said intensified efforts to expand testing, strengthen treatment uptake, eliminate stigma and discrimination across communities were necessary.
Speaking at the launch of the 23rd International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA 2025) in Accra, Dr Akanbong said the country was still far from meeting the first two UNAIDS benchmarks.
He explained that the 95-95-95 targets aim for 95 per cent of all people living with HIV to know their status, 95 per cent of those diagnosed to be on sustained treatment, and 95 per cent of those on treatment to achieve viral suppression.
Currently, only 68 per cent of people living with HIV in Ghana know their status. Of those who know their status, 69 per cent are on treatment, and 90 per cent of those on treatment have achieved viral suppression, he said.
We are doing relatively well with viral suppression, but the first two targets are nowhere near where we need to be. It is a worry, he added.
Dr Akanbong emphasised that the viral suppression, where the virus becomes undetectable in the blood, was only possible when individuals adhered to their medication.
He said: You suppress it to a point where the virus is no longer a threat to your health. At that stage, people can even safely have children. But this can only happen when people know their status and stay on treatment.
The Acting Director General attributed the low testing rates, especially among males with less than 20 per cent testing annually, to deeply rooted stigmatisation and discriminatory attitudes.
Ghanas HIV stigma index stands at 72 per cent, one of the highest in the sub-region, saying, People still fear sitting in the same room with someone living with HIV. Many prefer to seek help first from pastors or alternative healers instead of health facilities. These behaviours limit testing and prevent early treatment.
To address these challenges, the GAC is expanding access to HIV self-testing kits across the country through Antiretroviral Therapy Centres (ARTCs) and partnerships with the Youth Employment Agency.
About 5,000 young volunteers have been trained to serve as HIV self-testing ambassadors.
You can walk into any ARTC and request a self-test kit. You will be counselled and guided on how to use it. The aim is to bring testing closer to people and remove the fear of visiting hospitals, Dr Akanbong explained.
Dr Fiona Braka, World Health Organisation (WHO) Country Representative, urged African governments to invest in integrated health systems and ensure permanent budget allocations for HIV responses.
Our path to 2030 is short and challenging, but clear. We must unite in the fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria under the umbrella of universal health coverage.
Dr Braka urged the media and civil society organisations to support and serve as watchdogs, holding all stakeholders accountable.

Gov't strengthens measures to improve basic healthcare systems - Sanaa,"The Deputy Chief Executive of the Youth Employment Agency (YEA), Abdul Sanaa, says the government is working to strengthen measures to help improve basic healthcare systems across the country.
He said the government was putting in place sustainable policies that would make healthcare easily accessible to every Ghanaian.
He was speaking at the passing-out of 427 Community Medical First Responders (CMFR) trained at the Paramedics and Emergency Care training School, at Nkenkaasu in the Offinso north district.
The participants received intensive training in human anatomy, airway management, psychology, and first aid management, among others.
Mr Saanu said the YEA, through its policy initiatives, was implementing pragmatic measures to create opportunities for more youth to be engaged in basic health care delivery and other areas that would help improve the basic living conditions of Ghanaians.
He said the government was reviewing the allowances paid to YEA beneficiaries and ensuring prompt payment.
This, he said, would motivate them to deliver effectively and be dedicated to duty.
Dr George Owusu, CEO of the National Ambulance Service (NAS), said the Service was partnering with YEA to provide the Responders with the skills needed to enable them to discharge their duties effectively.

Ghana not meeting HIV targets despite declining new infections - Prof Opoku-Agyemang,"The Vice President, Professor
Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang
, says that although global progress toward the 95-95-95 HIV targets is encouraging, Ghana continues to lag in several key areas.
Speaking at the 23rd International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Accra on Thursday, December 4, 2025, she noted that while many countries are close to ensuring that 95 percent of people living with HIV know their status, receive sustained treatment and achieve viral suppression, the figures in Ghana show a significant gap, with only about 65 percent of people living with HIV currently aware of their status.
Over 45% of people living with HIV in Ashanti not on treatment
""While the 95, 95, 95 targets are within reach for many nations, others remain far behind in Ghana. Around 65% of people living with HIV know their status, and many are receiving life-saving treatment.
New infections have steadily declined, and community-led organizations remain the backbone of our response"", Prof Opoku-Agyemang noted.
The vice president said persons living with HIV in Africa continue to face challenges in accessing healthcare.

""Africa, home to over two-thirds of the global HIV burden, continues to face profound disparities in access and outcomes. While the 95, 95, 95 targets are within reach for many nations, others remain far behind in Ghana"", she added.
The UNAIDS 95-95-95 global target adopted by Member States in June 2021 requires countries to ensure that 95 per cent of people living with HIV are diagnosed, 95 per cent of those diagnosed are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95 per cent of those on ART achieve viral suppression (VLS) by 2025.

"Govt receives GH42m midwifery equipment, family planning supplies from UNFPA","The Deputy Minister of Health and Member of Parliament for Essikado-Ketan, Professor Grace Ayensu-Danquah, has received a significant consignment of midwifery training equipment under the Midwifery Education and Practice Centers of Excellence Programme (MEPCEP), aimed at strengthening competency-based training for student midwives across the country.
At a brief handover ceremony in Accra, Prof Ayensu-Danquah described the support as timely, noting that it aligns with Ghanas ongoing reforms to improve the standards of midwifery training and maternal health services.
This support comes at a time when we are working to improve the standards of midwifery training across the country. It will go a long way in strengthening the practical competencies of our students, she said.
The Deputy Minister expressed gratitude to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for its continued commitment to maternal and newborn health in Ghana, describing the partnership as invaluable.
She emphasised that building a strong midwifery workforce begins with access to quality learning tools and well-resourced training environments.
We expect that these resources will be used solely for teaching and skills training. Proper records must be maintained to ensure accountability, she added, urging heads of training institutions to safeguard the equipment and ensure its impact is sustained over time.
Delivering remarks on behalf of the UNFPA, its Country Representative, Dr Wilfred Ochan, announced that the agency had provided midwifery training equipment valued at GH2 million, alongside family planning commodities worth GH40 million, which are supplied to the Government of Ghana annually.
He described the donation not merely as a transfer of assets, but as an investment in the hands that will bring lives into the world, stressing the critical role midwives play in maternal health outcomes.
Evidence shows that a well-trained and well-supported midwife can provide up to 90% of essential reproductive, maternal, and newborn health services, Dr Ochan stated.
With midwives conducting about 70% of all deliveries in Ghana, he noted that practical, simulation-based training remains essential to reducing preventable maternal deaths. The donated items include anatomical models, simulation tools, and essential clinical equipment designed to bridge the gap between theory and real-life practice.
UNFPA currently procures 40% of Ghanas national contraceptive requirements, with USAID previously supplying another 45%. However, he warned that USAIDs withdrawal from contraceptive procurement has created a major supply gap that could worsen the countrys 33% unmet need for family planning.
He appealed to the Government of Ghana to scale up its co-financing commitments under the UNFPA Supplies Partnership to help close the gap.

HFFG calls for stronger domestic financing to prevent vaccine shortages,"The Hope for Future Generations (HFFG), a non-governmental organisation, has urged the Government to prioritise sustainable domestic financing for immunisation in the 2026 budget implementation to prevent a recurrence of crippling vaccine stockouts.
This call follows the presentation of the 2026 Budget, which increased the health sector allocation to GHS 22.8 billion.
HFFGs analysis was detailed in a release copied to the Ghana News Agency on Tuesday.
While commending this and other measures, it stressed that over-reliance on dwindling external support threatens the nations immunisation gains.
The release said that with Gavis co-financing support phasing out, Ghana urgently needs to secure sustainable domestic funding to prevent future vaccine stockouts, as experienced in 2022 and 2023.
It noted that inflationary pressures effectively reduced the real value of the health budget, constraining its purchasing power.
It cautioned that without decisive action, procurement delays and shortages could resurface, derailing progress towards Universal Health Coverage.
To build a self-reliant health system, HFFG proposed critical interventions. Top of the agenda is the creation of a dedicated,ring-fenced immunisation budget line within the national budget to ensure transparent and timely funding.
The release advocated the strategic mainstreaming of immunisation services into the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) benefit packages.
That, it said, would ensure equitable access and provide a predictable, long-term financial mechanism for vaccines.
Other recommendations include accelerating investment in the Ghana Vaccine Institute for local production and strengthening epidemic preparedness funding.
It called on policymakers to act swiftly in addressing those critical gaps to safeguard the health and well-being of citizens.",,Health,  3 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/HFFG-calls-for-stronger-domestic-financing-to-prevent-vaccine-shortages-2012143

US to provide $150 million to Zipline to boost Africa operations,"The United States Government has announced a commitment of up to $150 million to Zipline International Inc. to expand access to life-saving medical supplies including blood, vaccines, and essential medicines to as many as 15,000 health facilities across Cote dIvoire, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda.
This was announced in a U.S Embassy digital press briefing on Tuesday, December 2, 2025.
The support forms part of the U.S. Department of States new America First Global Health Strategy, which aims to increase value for U.S. taxpayers by reducing waste, eliminating dependency, and ensuring development assistance aligns with U.S. foreign policy priorities.
According to Jeff Graham of the U.S. Department of State, the strategy strongly emphasizes delivering critical medical products to populations in remote and underserved areas.
He said partnering with Zipline, an American robotics and drone-technology company, is central to modernizing the U.S. approach to global health.
Under the agreement, the U.S. will support the expansion of Ziplines American-made advanced robotics to address slow and unreliable logistics challenges that prevent timely access to essential health supplies in rural communities.
Graham described the initiative as a major step toward strengthening health systems ability to respond to disease outbreaks and emergencies while also supporting U.S. manufacturing and creating jobs across partner countries.
He emphasized that although the U.S. capital contribution is modest, beneficiary governments will eventually assume operational responsibility for their national health-delivery networks.
Zipline is expected to open new distribution centers across the five participating countries, with Rwanda projected to double its daily delivery capacity ultimately helping the network reach up to 130 million people in Africa.
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Zipline Africa, Caitlin Burton, explained that Zipline operates autonomous, all-weather drones day and night providing a centralized, on-demand medical-supply chain far more efficient than traditional logistics systems.
With support from organizations such as the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Zipline has built strong evidence showing that its delivery model is both cost-effective and highly impactful.
The new U.S. partnership is expected to enable Zipline to expand its services to national levels across all five countries, creating an estimated 1,000 jobs and generating more than $1 billion in annual economic gains across partner nations.
Burton said Ziplines broader mission is to strengthen health systems capable of ending preventable deaths from HIV transmission to maternal mortality and severe malnutrition using a single, high-performing national logistics network.
Speaking on taxpayer costs, she said, government investment levels will reflect national priorities and their commitment to building responsive, agile, and resilient health systems. Burton said expenditures vary depending on each countrys health needs.
Zipline collaborates closely with governments to identify, the most critical health burdens, areas where health systems fail to meet patient needs, access gaps in remote and underserved communities.
This system is meant to operate nationwide and at the scale required to deliver volumes of medical products that can actually change health outcomes. We now know how to solve challenges like maternal mortality and malnutrition, and the network is built to meet those goals, she noted.
She stressed that while the U.S. provides initial capital support, governments eventually cover the fixed and predictable long-term operating costs.
The model allows countries to replace multiple expensive, disease-specific programmes with one unified delivery infrastructure that addresses various health challenges simultaneously.
With this system, youre not funding a single program or a one-off intervention. Youre ensuring that essential medical products reach patients wherever they are including communities where distance or stigma might prevent people from seeking care, she said.",,Health,  3 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/US-to-provide-150-million-to-Zipline-to-boost-Africa-operations-2012103
Expectant mothers urged to attend antenatal clinic for safe delivery,"Senior Midwifery Officer at the New Atuabo Health Center in the Tarkwa Nsuaem Municipality, Regina Kudom, has urged expectant mothers to attend antenatal clinics regularly for safe delivery.
She revealed that in Tarkwa and its environs, many pregnant women prefer staying at prayer camps, we are not against that, you can be there, but when your time is up for your antenatal session, make sure you attend.
Mrs. Kudom gave the advice when the Gold Fields Ghana Foundation (GFGF) observed World Prematurity Day with pregnant women at New Atuabo, Huniso, and Awudua health centers.
World Prematurity Day falls on November 17 every year, and it is celebrated to raise awareness about the challenges faced by pre-term babies and their families.
She said research suggested that sex during pregnancy could soften the cervix and potentially aid in labour preparation.
That is the reason why we encourage pregnant women to have sex with
their partners, if they do not have any health implications, She added
Mrs. Kudom appealed to the GFGF to upgrade the New Atuabo health center, as the current structure was too small because it received many patients daily.
Madam Ayishetu Mohammed, Project Coordinator for GFGF, explained that they received donations from Project C. U. R. E and the items were given to health facilities in their operational area.
She said they noticed there were baby dresses, sanitary pads, and baby apparel, so they decided to distribute them among expectant mothers in three of their host communities.
Madam Mohammed said that because the Foundation was interested in preventive care, they brought a midwife from the Tarkwa Mine hospital to educate pregnant women.
She extolled the midwives in New Atuabo health center for the education they gave to the pregnant women and implored them to heed the advice given during antenatal visits to reduce maternal deaths in the Tarkwa Nsuaem and Prestea Huni-Valley Municipalities.
Mr. Paa Kwasi Egan, Deputy Chief Physician Assistant, emphasized that a pregnant woman being anemic meant she was not eating a balanced diet, adding that, Some of these women do not have money to buy food or visit antenatal clinics.
He said that when men follow their wives for antenatal visits, they would
be educated extensively on why they should provide funds for their pregnant wives.
Mr. Egan, therefore, encouraged all men to be involved in their pregnant wives antenatal care appointments so they could learn more about pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.",,Health,  3 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Expectant-mothers-urged-to-attend-antenatal-clinic-for-safe-delivery-2012095
NACP calls for collective action to end HIV/AIDS as public health threat,"The National AIDS/STI Control Programme (NACP) has called for urgent nationwide collective action to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.
The call follows the spike in HIV new infections in the country, with 15,290 new infection cases recorded in 2024, approximately 42 new infections every single day.
Speaking at a news conference in Accra on Tuesday to commemorate this years World AIDS Day, Dr Emmanuel Akwoulo Agyigewe Teviu, Programme Manager, NACP, described the situation as concerning, stressing the need for immediate action to reverse the trend.
According to the 2024 national and sub-national HIV/AIDS estimates and projections, 334,721 people are living with HIV in Ghana, out of which 229,261 are female and 105,460 male. Also, 12,614 AIDS-related deaths were recorded in 2024 as well.
Additionally, 67.4 per cent of all new infections are among females, with children constituting 5.4 per cent of people living with HIV AIDS, which translates into 18,229 infections for children.
Currently, the countrys National adult HIV prevalence stood at 1.49 per cent.
Dr Teviu said these numbers highlighted the urgent need for collective action in the national response in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
These numbers represent our mothers, fathers, daughters, sisters, brothers, and friends, he stressed.
We have the tools. We have the knowledge. What we need now is collective action from government, civil society, communities, and every individual.
Dr Teviu also said Ghanas performance against the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets remained a major concern, currently standing at 68-69-90.
The UNAIDS 95-95-95 global target requires nations to ensure that 95 per cent of people living with HIV are diagnosed, 95 per cent of those diagnosed with HIV are receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95 per cent of all those receiving ART achieve viral suppression (VLS) by 2025.
Dr Teviu noted that the countrys biggest gaps laid in the first two targets, which focused on identifying people living with HIV and ensuring prompt initiation of treatment.
Our problem is not treatment effectiveness; our problem is finding people and getting them started on treatment, he stressed.
He, therefore, called for more resources to be committed to fight against the virus to ensure the country achieves the targets.
However, despite these gaps, Dr. Teviu indicated that the country had made significant strides in combating the disease, noting that in 2024 alone, 12,358 deaths were prevented through antiretroviral therapy (ART), saving an average of 229 lives each week.
He also cited the attainment of 90 per cent viral suppression among those on treatment, describing it as clear evidence that Ghanas treatment regime was effective.
Ninety percent viral suppression is proof that when people access treatment, they live long, healthy lives, Dr Teviu noted.
He urged more Ghanaians to prioritise HIV testing, encouraging those who test positive to immediately start ART treatment to better their chances of staying healthy and living longer.
Testing is the gateway. If you dont know your status, you cannot protect yourself or access life-saving care, the spokesperson stressed.
With early and consistent treatment, you can achieve viral suppression and live a full life. When your viral load is undetectable, you cannot transmit HIV, what we call U=U, he explained.
With women bearing the disproportionate burden of HIV in Ghana, Dr Teviu called for strengthened prevention programmes, address gender-based violence, ensure economic empowerment, and provide woman-centred care.
He also called for a renewed efforts to end stigma and discrimination against persons living with the virus to ensure their safety.
Stigma kills. Silence kills. We must create communities where everyone feels safe to seek help, Dr Teviu added.",,Health,  3 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/NACP-calls-for-collective-action-to-end-HIV-AIDS-as-public-health-threat-2012092
"Presidents Mahama, Tshisekedi to lead Health Financing summit in Accra on Dec 3","President John Dramani Mahama and the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Felix Tshisekedi, will on Wednesday, December 3, lead a high-level summit in Accra on Regional Health Leadership and Sustainable Financing for Africa. This will be done right after the opening of the International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA 2025).
The summit is organised by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) Global Public Health Institute and the Society for AIDS in Africa (SAA). A statement issued by the AHF in Accra on Monday said the meeting aligned with the Africa CDCs New Public Health Order and the African Unions Agenda 2063.
It is expected to galvanise African-led solutions to strengthen continental health systems, enhance domestic financing, and promote regional manufacturing to improve preparedness for future health emergencies. It is expected to bring together heads of state, ministers of health and finance, development partners, civil society groups, parliamentarians, and private sector leaders to discuss how to sustain pandemic prevention efforts.
The statement said discussions at the summit would draw on lessons from Africas decades-long HIV response to help shape more sustainable pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response frameworks across the continent. Dr Jorge Saavedra, Executive Director, AHF Global Public Health Institute, said sustained health financing and stronger regional production capacity were essential for Africas long-term health security.
Sustainable health financing and regional production are not just political priorities, are imperatives for Africas health security and prosperity, he was quoted as saying. The summit underscores the need for bold leadership, innovative financing, and cross-sector collaboration to secure the continents health future.
It will include a presidential fireside chat featuring Ghanas President Mahama and DRC President Tshisekedi. Ghanas Minister of Health, Mr Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, will introduce the session, which will be moderated by Dr Michel Sidibe, African Union Special Envoy for the African Medicines Agency.
A ministerial dialogue on sustainable and innovative health financing will also feature health leaders from Nigeria, South Africa, and Benin and the DRC, alongside the Director-General of Africa CDC, Dr Jean Kaseya, and Ghanas Minister of Finance, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson. Another session on regional production, leadership and community engagement would bring together experts from the WHO Regional Office for Africa, the International Vaccine Institute, Kenyas KELIN, and academia.
That would be co-moderated by Prof. Morenike Ukpong of the Society for AIDS in Africa, and Dr Benjamin Djoudalbaye of the Africa CDC. After that, an HIV advocate, Doreen Moraa Moracha, will deliver a call-to-action statement to close the summit.
The statement said the AHF would also host two fireside chats sessions at its exhibition booth during the ICASA. On December 4, a panel led by Dr Iutung and Dr Saavedra will discuss strategies to strengthen Africas health security through regional leadership and sustainable financing, it said. The statement said the second session on December 6 will focus on the importance of a prevention-first approach in HIV and STI control, balancing biomedical interventions with behavioural strategies such as condom use and community-led education.

Over 45% of people living with HIV in Ashanti not on treatment,"More than 40 per cent of people living with HIV in the Ashanti Region are currently not on treatment, posing a significant public health risk, the Regional Director of Health Services, Dr. Fred Adomako-Boateng, has revealed.
Speaking at a media briefing to mark this years World AIDS Day in Kumasi, Dr Adomako-Boateng expressed concern that despite notable progress in HIV testing and treatment uptake, a large treatment gap continues to undermine efforts to control the spread of the virus.
According to him, out of an estimated 63,159 people living with HIV in the region that should be on treatment, only 33,199, representing 52.9 per cent are currently receiving antiretroviral therapy.
This means approximately 29,960 individuals either do not know their HIV status or are not on medication.
This gap poses a significant public health risk, and the only way to bridge it is by improving testing, increasing awareness, and making prevention services easily accessible everywhere, he said.
Dr Adomako-Boateng noted that although the region had recorded progress such as a 28.2 per cent increase in clients on treatment and thousands of new enrolments, the gains would be undermined if people continued to shy away from testing and treatment.
He stressed that HIV was preventable, and free testing and treatment available at health facilities across the region.
Knowing your status is the first and most powerful step in protecting yourself and those you love, he said, urging especially men and young people to take testing seriously.
The Regional Health Director further highlighted the availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily medication that reduces the risk of acquiring HIV by more than 90 per cent.
Dr Adomako-Boateng also emphasised the urgent need to end stigma and discrimination, which he described as major barriers to testing and treatment.
Stigma prevents people from testing and forces others to hide.
HIV is a health condition, not a moral judgment.
People living with HIV deserve love, respect, and dignity, he stressed.
He assured the public that the Ashanti Regional Health Directorate remained committed to expanding access to HIV services through stronger collaboration with traditional leaders, schools, and the media.
He urged the public to take personal responsibility for protection and testing.",,Health,  2 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Over-45-of-people-living-with-HIV-in-Ashanti-not-on-treatment-2011960
Why Mahama Ayariga wants Zipiline contract cancelled,"The Majority Leader in
Parliament
,
Mahama Ayariga
, has said he called for the cancellation of the contract between the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and Zipline Ghana, which delivers critical medical supplies to remote health facilities.
According to him, the GHS should develop its own capacity to deliver essential medical supplies, rather than spending GH170 million annually on Zipline Ghana to transport blood and other products by drone.
Zipline contract costs government more than half a million dollars a month - Akandoh
""The Ministry of Health should have bought its own drones by now; you cannot continue spending that kind of money that you are paying a service provider, as it is a total waste of money. So please, that is my personal view of the matter,"" he said.
His comments follow concerns raised by the Minority Leader in
Parliament
, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, over the potential cancellation of the contract.
Zipline Ghana, which marked five years of operations in the country in 2024, has played a key role in bridging healthcare delivery in remote areas where infrastructure challenges often delay timely medical deliveries.
Zipline faces potential closure amid GH174 million debt crisis
Meanwhile, the Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, says the government's ongoing engagements with Zipline will determine the future of its medical drone delivery contract.

Abuakwa North marks World AIDS Day with public sensitisation at New Tafo Hospital,"The Abuakwa North Municipal HIV/AIDS Committee has organised a public sensitisation exercise at the Akyem New Tafo Government Hospital OPD to commemorate World AIDS Day, observed globally on December 1 to raise awareness on HIV and strengthen prevention efforts.
During the engagement, the committee educated residents on the rising rate of HIV infections, prevention strategies, early testing, and proper treatment adherence.
Members of the public received counselling and health information aimed at reducing new infections within the municipality.
Speaking at the sidelines of the event, Mamatta Alhassan Abdulai, spokesperson for the committee, expressed deep concern over the continuous rise in new cases.
She disclosed that the municipality recorded 123 new HIV cases between January and July 2025, with the next quarters figures yet to be released.
Although the committee regularly visits communities, churches, and public gatherings to educate residents, she said the increasing numbers remain worrying.
She urged the public to practice abstinence, use protection, and undergo regular medical screening.
Adding national context to the situation,  Maxwell Osei Owusu, SVP for Advancement and Medication Access at ACTS Ghana, highlighted major challenges facing Ghanas HIV response.
He revealed that between 2013 and 2023, more than 568,000 people were newly diagnosed, but only half were placed on treatment, leaving a significant treatment gap.
He also noted a worrying decline in treatment retention, with over 68,000 people dropping out of care in just one year (20222023).
He called for stronger linkage to care, improved follow-up systems, adoption of long-acting treatment options, and re-engagement of those who have stopped treatment.
Also contributing to the discussion, Rev Ofori Asirifi, Chairman of the Local Council of Churches in Abuakwa North and Area Head of the Assemblies of God Church, warned that HIV is no respecter of persons, and urged residents to avoid casual sexual behaviour and sharing sharp objects.
He lamented that some people now behave as though the disease is normal and called on the government to intensify national campaigns to protect the next generation.

Government hikes NHIS tariffs by 120% to revive ailing healthcare system,"The government, through the Ministry of Health, has announced a major step toward stabilising and strengthening the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) with an average 120% increase in tariffs paid to healthcare service providers, effective in 2026.
The announcement was made by the Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, during the Government Accountability Series on Monday, December 1, 2025. According to him, the review is a direct response to longstanding complaints from hospitals and clinics that NHIS tariffs had become inadequate and economically unsustainable.
The upward adjustment marks one of the most significant financial interventions in the history of the NHIS, signalling the governments acknowledgment of the severe financial strain faced by service providers  often resulting in reluctance to accept NHIS patients or a decline in service quality.
Mr Akandoh stressed that the drastic increase is necessary and timely, as it will help restore confidence among healthcare providers and strengthen the overall functioning of the national insurance system.
Beginning next year [2026], were going to increase the tariff in the NHIS to the service providers because it is something the service providers have been complaining about, that the tariffs we give them are unrealistic.
The minister believes that raising the average payment rate by 120% will fundamentally change the landscape of healthcare delivery in Ghana:
And so, the government has made the decision to increase the tariff by 120% on average, and I believe this is going to be a game-changer, Mr Akandoh stated.",,Health,  1 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Government-hikes-NHIS-tariffs-by-120-to-revive-ailing-healthcare-system-2011805

CHST pushes for nationwide LHIMS deployment across over 100 Catholic health facilities,"The Catholic Health Service TrustGhana (CHST) has formally requested the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) to extend the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS) to more than 100 Catholic health facilities across the country, in what could become one of the largest digital health rollouts in Ghanas faith-based health sector.
The request, dated April 14, 2025, was addressed to CHAGs Executive Director and copied to the Deputy Executive Director. CHST described the move as a strategic step toward strengthening health information systems and improving the overall quality of care within its extensive network of hospitals, polyclinics, health centres and clinics.
According to the Trust, Catholic health facilities already operating LHIMS are witnessing remarkable improvements in patient data management, clinical decision-making and operational efficiency. CHST believes scaling the system to all its facilities will enhance the accuracy of clinical records, reduce delays in service delivery and support better health outcomes nationwide.
To facilitate the rollout, CHST has assigned its Monitoring, Evaluation and Compliance Unit, led by Frank Kpoh, to coordinate directly with CHAG.
He is expected to provide technical and administrative support throughout the deployment process, ensuring a smooth transition for all beneficiary institutions.
Attached to the request was a comprehensive list of more than 100 facilities earmarked for LHIMS installation. These facilities are spread across all 16 regions, including the Ahafo, Ashanti, Bono, Bono East, Central, Eastern, Greater Accra, Northern, Savannah, North East, Upper East, Upper West, Volta, Western and Western North regions.
Some of the facilities listed include :
St Josephs Catholic Hospital, Wenchi  Bono Region
Pieta Catholic Hospital, Sampa  Bono Region
Tatale Catholic District Hospital, Tatale  Northern Region
Holy Spirit Catholic Polyclinic, Kwesi Fante  Eastern Region
Nativity of Our Lady Catholic Polyclinic, Ko  Upper West Region
St Georges Catholic Polyclinic, Liati  Volta Region
Santa Maria Refuge Camp Catholic Health Centre, Krisan  Western Region
The request was signed by Dr Lawrence Ofosu Adjare, Deputy Director of Health for CHST, on behalf of the Director of Health. In concluding the letter, the Trust reaffirmed its longstanding motto: God is our Help and Health.
If approved by CHAG, the deployment will represent a major milestone in Ghanas healthcare digitisation efforts. LHIMSalready widely recognised for improving electronic medical recordshas been pivotal in helping facilities streamline patient flow, reduce paperwork, and ensure timely access to medical information.
Health analysts say the move could significantly boost national progress toward a fully integrated digital health ecosystem, especially within the private and mission-based health subsector, which serves millions of Ghanaians annually.
With more than 100 additional facilities poised to go digital, CHSTs request signals a bold push toward modernising healthcare delivery and strengthening data-driven by decision-making in Ghanas evolving health landscape.

MOH issues health advisory as Ghana prepares for dry Harmattan season,"The
Ministry of Health
(MOH), through the
Ghana Health Service
(GHS), has issued a public health alert as the country prepares for the onset of the dry Harmattan season, despite recent rainfalls in parts of the country.
In a statement dated December 1, 2025, the ministry warned that the Harmattan weather poses several health risks due to its dry, dusty and windy conditions, which affect various parts of the body.
The Harmattan weather affects almost every part of the body, and awareness of the associated risks is essential for preventing illness, the statement said.
We may record a lot of respiratory infections after the harmattan - Ghana Meteo
It stressed that awareness and early preventive measures are essential to reduce illness during the season.
According to the MOH/GHS, common health risks associated with the Harmattan include skin dryness and irritation, dehydration, respiratory challenges resulting from high dust levels, eye irritation, and an increased risk of meningitis, especially as Ghana lies within Africas meningitis belt.
The Harmattan period is known for significantly reduced humidity, which can worsen breathing difficulties for people with asthma and other respiratory conditions, while also increasing susceptibility to infections.
To help the public stay healthy during this period, the ministry has outlined several preventive measures.
These include regular moisturising of the skin with oil-based products, such as shea butter, drinking plenty of water, and consuming water-rich foods such as watermelon and soups.
The statement also advised the public to wear face masks in dusty environments, especially individuals with asthma, who are urged to avoid dusty areas and limit outdoor activities.
Navigating challenges during Ghana's harmattan season: Safeguarding security and well-being
Protective eyewear such as sunglasses is recommended to prevent dust-related eye irritation.
Ghanaians are further encouraged to wash their hands frequently, avoid touching their faces, and seek prompt medical attention at the nearest health facility if they feel unwell.
The
Ministry of Health
and the
Ghana Health Service

Telecel Foundation extends rural ultrasound initiative to Kubori in the North East Region,"Telecel Ghana Foundation has organised its maternal health programme, the Rural Ultrasound Initiative in Kubori, a hard-to-reach community in the North East region, offering vital healthcare screening for pregnant women.
The medical outreach team provided ultrasound scans and haemoglobin (HB) checks for 169 pregnant women, marking one of the largest rural screenings conducted under the health outreach this year.
The screening exercise brought together expectant mothers from Kubori and surrounding communities including Kpatarigu, Fagbong, Yag-Namoo, Wirangu, Kilaayiri, Ezesi, Sagua, Mankarigu, Gombongu, Soo, and Yirangu, giving them rare access to diagnostic services that are often out of reach due to distance, cost, and transportation challenges to equipped health centres.
The Rural Ultrasound Screening, a Telecel Ghana Foundation initiative in partnership with Divine Mother and Child (DMAC) Foundation and the Ghana Health Service, aims to ensure that pregnant women in underserved communities receive timely detection of complications and appropriate medical guidance throughout their pregnancy.
Ralina Abu, a beneficiary of the exercise, after undergoing her first ever ultrasound and receiving the Foundations care package, said the outreach has transformed her pregnancy experience by easing all her worries and financial burden.
The midwives shared information about my unborn babys health and that has given me some relief and confidence about my pregnancy. Thank you to Telecel Ghana Foundation for the care, she said.
During the screening exercise, two expectant mothers were diagnosed with intrauterine fetal death, and one with ovarian cyst. Screening team refers early detection of these conditions to local health workers to help prevent further pregnancy complications.
Salifu Rashida, a midwife at Kubori Polyclinic, said many rural pregnant women struggle to access ultrasound services due to long distances and high costs. She explained that the free outreach by Telecel Ghana Foundation has been essential in helping detect complications early and giving mothers reassurance.
Telecel brand officially launched in Ghana
Founder of DMAC Foundation, Edmund Doudu, recounted the difficulty of getting to Kubori by road for this outreach. He arrived covered in red dust from the hours long journey through the dusty roads and humid weather to the community.
Kubori was one of the hardest and most remote places we have visited in the past 11 years since we started partnering with the Foundation. Reaching these women and providing essential maternal care was both important and deeply impactful.
Government to merge AT Ghana with Telecel
The Rural Ultrasound Initiative is carried out bimonthly and focuses on remote and deprived communities where maternal healthcare services remain limited.
The programme supports the progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 on Good Health and Well-being, particularly in reducing maternal mortality.
Rita Agyeiwaa Rockson, Head of Foundation, Sustainability and External Communications at Telecel Ghana, said, We are committed to equitable healthcare because no woman should lack access to a simple ultrasound scan that could save her life and protect her unborn child.
As part of the outreach, healthcare personnel also conducted health education sessions on prenatal nutrition, antenatal care, and the importance of regular checkups. Telecel Ghana Foundation offered care packages containing essential newborn items to support expectant mothers as they prepare for safe delivery.

Ghana losing over half a billion dollars annually on imported sugary juice concentrates - Expert,"Ghana is losing more than US$600 million every year importing fruit juices, many of which are made from artificial concentrates, high sugar formulations and low-nutrient blends that offer little or no fibre to consumers.
Industry data shows that in 2020 alone, Ghana spent over US$646 million on imported juice and beverage products, placing heavy pressure on foreign exchange reserves and contributing to the depreciation of the cedi.
Despite Ghanas strong natural advantage in pineapple, citrus, mango, papaya, coconut, passion fruit and other tropical crops, the country continues to import syrup-based and sugar-loaded beverages from Europe, South Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.
Experts warn that this not only drains the economy but also exposes consumers to non-healthy, fiberless, ultra-processed juice substitutes that do little to support national nutrition goals.
A Double Crisis: FX Loss and Health Concerns
Most imported fruit beverages sold in Ghana are:
Reconstituted from artificial concentrate
High in added sugars and sweeteners
Low or zero dietary fibre
Stripped of natural nutrients during processing
Sometimes flavoured rather than real fruit-based
Health advocates note that these beverages contribute to rising concerns about:
Childhood obesity
Diabetes
Diet-related non-communicable diseases
Poor nutritional outcomes despite high consumption
Ghana is losing over half a billion dollars a year importing drinks that offer little nutritional value, a nutrition analyst said.
Meanwhile, our own natural fruitsrich in vitamins, enzymes, antioxidants, and fibre are left unprocessed or wasted.
Local Production Can Save FX and Promote Healthier Consumption
Agro-industrial experts argue that Ghana can save US$300US$600 million annually by substituting imports with locally produced natural juices, teas, fruit beverages, and fermented drinks like tepache. Local production also allows:
Fresher, healthier beverages
Minimal sugar
High-fibre natural fruit content
Retention of micronutrients
Stronger consumer safety regulations
Imported concentrates rarely match the nutritional quality of natural Ghanaian fruits, an agro-processor explained.
By processing locally, we can control sugar levels, quality, and freshness.
Massive Job Creation for the Youth
Developing the full fruit and beverage value chain could create 30,000 to 60,000 jobs across farming, processing, packaging, logistics, and export channels.
Opportunities include:
Youth-owned orchards
Outgrower networks
Aseptic and UHT factories
Tetra Pak and canning lines
Beverage innovation labs
Digital distribution platforms
This aligns with Ghanas youth employment strategy and 24-hour economy vision.
Export Growth Under AfCFTA
With AfCFTA headquartered in Accra, Ghana is positioned to become West Africas leading hub for natural juice and fruit-based beverages, exporting to a 1.3-billion-person continental market.
Potential export earnings could reach US$150US$250 million annually with a consistent supply.
A Call for National Action
Stakeholders are urging government and investors to:
Scale fruit cultivation and irrigation
Finance modern factories
Support outgrower schemes
Prioritise natural beverages over artificial imports
Strengthen quality and nutritional regulations
Promote local brands in supermarkets and hotels
This is a national opportunity, a senior economist said. We can replace unhealthy imports with healthier local products, save foreign exchange, create thousands of jobs, and build a stronger cedi.
Conclusion
Ghana continues to lose over half a billion dollars every year on imported, sugar-loaded, low-fibre juice concentrateswhile its natural fruit goes underutilised.
With targeted investment in local production, Ghana can improve public health, retain FX, expand exports, and transform its fruit and beverage sector into a major economic pillar.",,Health, 30 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ghana-losing-over-half-a-billion-dollars-annually-on-imported-sugary-juice-concentrates-Expert-2011629
Korea honours Ghanas Health Service boss for strengthening GhanaKorea health cooperation,"Ghanas health diplomacy earned global recognition this week as the Acting Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Dr Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, received the Diplomatic Service Medal from the President of the Republic of Korea, Lee Jae Myung.
The award, presented at the 2025 Korea Development Cooperation Day in Seoul, celebrates Dr Akoriyeas pivotal role in strengthening GhanaKorea health cooperation and his long-standing leadership in global health development.
Dr Akoriyea was honoured for his central contribution to establishing and expanding the work of the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare (KOFIH) in Ghanaan institution he helped anchor within the GHS as far back as 2013.

Gender-based violence requires a united national front - Isaac Okpoti Adjei,"The General Manager of Movenpick Ambassador Hotel, Accra, Isaac Okpoti Adjei has called for a more coordinated and resolute national response to gender-based violence (GBV), stressing the need for early education, stronger punitive systems, and broader collaboration across state and private institutions.
Speaking at the hotels Women Empowerment Summit on November 28, 2025, themed Breaking the Silence: Advancing Justice, Accountability and Support to End Gender-Based Violence, Adjei noted that although Ghana has made progress in public awareness, the country still faces entrenched attitudes, especially among adolescents, that weaken the fight against abuse.
He said community attitudes often normalise harmful behaviour and discourage victims from seeking help, adding that schools, parents and youth-focused organisations must prioritise conversations that build respect, empathy and accountability from an early age.
According to him, adolescent boys and girls form some of their strongest perceptions about relationships between ages 10 and 17. If these perceptions are shaped by harmful gender norms, abusive behaviour can become accepted as normal.
Isaac Okpoti Adjei therefore called for modernised, age-appropriate educational programmes, saying young people should learn early that GBV is not only a criminal offence but a violation of dignity and human rights.
The Movenpick GM also urged government agencies to intensify reforms aimed at ensuring justice for survivors. He emphasised that delays in prosecution, weak sanctions and the tendency to blame victims continue to embolden perpetrators.
We must build a system where victims feel protected and perpetrators are held fully accountable, Isaac Adjei stated.
He advocated for strengthening the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU), improving shelter services, and resourcing community-based social workers, which he believes are essential steps toward justice and prevention.
Adjei also encouraged the private sector to play a more active role by offering safe reporting channels at workplaces, supporting awareness campaigns, and partnering with civil society organisations that provide counselling and legal support.
According to him, businesses have both a moral responsibility and a practical interest in protecting staff and communities from abuse.
The GM highlighted Movenpicks own efforts in staff training, gender policies and community engagement, explaining that hotels often serve as public-facing institutions and therefore have a unique platform to promote protection, equality and dignity.
He called for similar initiatives across the hospitality sector, noting that collective action can amplify national impact.
He concluded by urging all stakeholders, government, private sector, civil society and families, to treat GBV as a collective challenge rather than an individual issue.
Ending gender-based violence requires strong policies, strong institutions, and strong societal will. We cannot wait for another tragedy before we act, he said.",,Health, 29 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Gender-based-violence-requires-a-united-national-front-Isaac-Okpoti-Adjei-2011527
HeFRA Registrar leads intensified rehabilitation drive in Krobo,"The Krobo area is battling a deepening drug abuse crisis, with growing numbers of youth frequenting makeshift ghettos that have become centres for substance use and related criminal activities.
As the menace expands, the Health Facilities Regulatory Agency (HEFRA) Registrar, Dr Winfred Korletey Baah, is spearheading a rehabilitation-driven intervention aimed at rescuing affected youth and restoring community safety.
Across communities in Lower Manya and Yilo Krobo, drug ghettos have become increasingly common, attracting unemployed young men and women who engage in the abuse of marijuana, tramadol, and other illicit substances. Local authorities warn that the trend is not only escalating health risks but also fueling petty crime, violence and social instability.
According to Dr Baah, recent statistics from the District Health Management Team confirm a steady rise in drug dependency among young peoplean alarming development that informed his decision to prioritize rehabilitation as the core strategy in tackling the crisis.
Ive observed the data, and drug abuse among the youth is clearly on the rise, he said. We cannot simply arrest or shame individuals battling addiction. Drug addiction is a medical problem, and rehabilitation must be at the centre of our response.
Dr Baah revealed that his office, in partnership with several NGOs, has begun relocating addicted youth from ghettos into rehabilitation facilities. These organisations, he explained, are currently bearing the financial cost of treatment to ensure that the inability to pay does not prevent affected youth from receiving help.
We have some facilities doing rehabilitation for those who have gone beyond mere counselling, he said. We are trying to rehabilitate some of them and get them a job so they can fit well into society.
He added that many of the young people brought in for treatment would have otherwise remained trapped in a cycle of addiction and crime.
The goal, he stressed, is not only to cleanse the communities of drug misuse but to offer the youth a realistic chance at rebuilding their lives.
Beyond institutional rehabilitation, Dr Baahs initiative includes extensive community outreach aimed at preventing new cases of addiction. Working with civil society groups, his team is visiting communities, ghettos and youth gathering points to educate young people about the psychological and physical dangers of substance abuse.
Ive engaged some NGOs, and weve started going to the communities to advise people about the adverse effects of drug abuse, he noted. Another NGO is picking up some of the addicts, training them and providing skills that can sustain them after rehabilitation.
These sensitisation campaigns, he said, are crucial for dispelling myths that fuel drug useparticularly the belief that drugs enhance strength, confidence or intelligence.
Drug abuse doesnt end anybody well, it destroys your body. It will not make you strong or intelligent,"" he warned.
To prevent relapse, Dr Baah is ensuring that rehabilitation is tied closely to employability. He pointed out that unemployment remains a major driver of drug dependency, pushing many young people toward ghettos where drugs and criminal networks thrive.
In response, the government and local authorities are placing rehabilitated youth in vocational training programmes, including carpentry, masonry and security service recruitment initiatives.
Weve recruited a lot of the youth into employable skills programmes, once they gain skills and opportunities, the temptation to return to drugs reduces significantly.
Dr Baah also clarified law enforcements role in the anti-drug campaign. Police, he noted, generally avoid arresting addicts unless criminal activity is involved. Instead, they often transport them to hospitals for assessment and referral to rehabilitation centres.
Addiction is a medical problem, but some individuals also engage in crime, we handle both sides appropriately.
With rehabilitation, skills training and community education now working hand in hand, Dr Baah believes the tide can be turned. He is hopeful that the Krobo area will soon see a reduction in addiction and the rebuilding of lives once overshadowed by drugs.",,Health, 27 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/HeFRA-Registrar-leads-intensified-rehabilitation-drive-in-Krobo-2011262
Ghana struggling with rising fistula cases during childbirth  GHS,"Ghana is experiencing a concerning decline in maternal and child health outcomes, despite an increase in trained health workers.
According to Dr Kennedy Brightson, Director for Public Health at the Ghana Health Service, key indicators such as skilled delivery coverage, adolescent antenatal attendance and child immunisation have all recorded steady declines between 2022 and 2024.
Speaking at the 5th Maternal, Child Health and Nutrition Conference in Accra, Dr Brightson expressed dismay at the rising number of maternal deaths, with 806 pregnant women dying in 2022, 861 in 2023 and 819 in 2024.
""Eight hundred maternal deaths a year is not something we should ever accept,"" he emphasised.
The conference, themed ""Strengthening Free Primary Health Care  Accelerating Equity and Access to Reproductive, Maternal, Child, Adolescent and Nutrition Services towards attainment of the SDG 2030,"" highlighted the need for urgent investments in primary health care, nutrition and quality of care to avert preventable deaths and rising complications among women and children.
Dr Brightson noted that the rising incidence of Vesico-Vaginal Fistula (VVF), a childbirth injury that leaves women leaking urine continuously, is a major complication confronting maternal health.
Despite specialists repairing fistula cases, the numbers remain overwhelming, with only 80 repairs targeted in 2025 due to limited funding.
The Ghana Health Service is calling for stronger health financing, improved supply chains, better coordination across government agencies and expanded community health systems to address these challenges.
""Primary health care is the backbone of our health system. If it fails, mothers, newborns, children, adolescents and the elderly will pay the price,"" Dr Brightson warned.
Other speakers at the conference highlighted the silent nutrition crisis in Ghana, with rising consumption of ultra-processed foods and poor food-related behaviours contributing to high deficiencies in essential micronutrients among women and children.
Dr Maxwell Bisala Konla, a dietitian at the University of Ghana Hospital, urged the government to make healthy diets more affordable and integrate nutrition into every primary health care touchpoint.

Zipline Shutdown: People will die needlessly without essential supplies  Dr Ayew Afriye,"Member of Parliament for Effiduase-Asokore, Dr
Nana Ayew Afriye
, has disclosed that Zipline, the drone-delivery service responsible for transporting blood, vaccines and emergency medicines to remote communities has begun decommissioning some of its centres.
According to the MP, Zipline is closing three of its operations out of six centres due to lack of government engagement and unpaid arrears.
Contributing to the 2026 Budget debate on Tuesday, Dr Ayew Afriye disclosed that the centres include Anum (Volta/Eastern/Afram Plains); Sefwi Wiawso (Western North/Central/Western corridor; and Kete-Krachi (Oti/Afram Plains).
People will die needlessly from lack of blood, medications and essential supplies. This shutdown begins today. This is terrifying for ordinary Ghanaians in remote areas, he warned.
The MP disclosed that Zipline is currently owed over GH175 million, far exceeding the GH20 million provisioned in the budget for operations.
The MP slammed the governments 2026 budget, accusing the Ministry of Health of presenting inconsistent figures, misrepresenting National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) allocations, and covering up dire challenges in Ghanas health delivery system.
According to him, the governments claim of uncapping NHIA funds and ensuring stable financing for vaccines and primary healthcare under the MahamaCare initiative is inaccurate and misleading.
There is a high level of inconsistency as far as this budget is concerned. You cannot write in this statement that the NHIF was uncapped when you know very well that the available funds are far less than what you claim, he stated.
Dr Afriye referenced paragraph 590 of the budget, which states that the NHIA enjoys full access to its funds due to the removal of the fiscal cap. He argued, however, that after deductions for the MahamaCare Trust Fund, the actual allocation available to the NHIA reduces significantly.
He stressed that the original envelope of GH10 billion has been revised to GH8 billion, with a 20% (GH1.6 billion) deduction to the MahamaCare Trust.
What remains for the NHIA is GH6.4 billion, less than the GH6.8 billion released the previous year. We cannot sit here and pretend the NHIA has more money when in reality they have less to work with, he added.
Dr Afriye also accused the Ministry of Health of misleading the public about the number of nurses recruited in 2025. While the government claims 13,500 nurses have been placed on the payroll this year, Dr Afriyie says these numbers include backlogs from the 2020 clearance, not newly-recruited 2021 or 2022 nursing graduates.
You are enjoying clearance from last year but claiming it as your achievement this year. The 2021 batch of nurses and midwives have not been placed on payroll. They are listening to me. None of them has been engaged, he argued.
He warned that failure to recruit both 2021 and 2022 nurses would push the health sector into a deeper crisis.
Dr Afriye maintained that the government must urgently address outstanding recruitments, restore Zipline operations, and realign NHIA financing if its national reset agenda is to be taken seriously",,Health, 26 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Zipline-Shutdown-People-will-die-needlessly-without-essential-supplies-Dr-Ayew-Afriye-2011126
Ghana to acquire DNA testing machine for Noguchi Memorial Institute,"The Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, has announced that the government is in the final stages of procuring a DNA testing machine for the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, aimed at strengthening the countrys diagnostic, forensic, and research capabilities.
Speaking at the 2025 Annual Research Meeting (ARM) in Accra, Minister Akandoh revealed that the purchase order for the DNA testing equipment has already been placed and the procurement process is almost complete.
He said the machine is expected to arrive at the institute within the next few months.
The Minister explained that the decision was informed by lessons learned following the recent tragic helicopter crash that claimed the lives of two ministers.
At the time, biological samples had to be sent abroad for DNA analysis due to the absence of local capacity.
It is no more a promise; it is something that is in action, Minister Akandoh said, recalling that the incident highlighted the urgent need for Ghana to have its own DNA testing facility.
He added that, following the crash, His Excellency the President directed that a DNA testing machine be procured for the Noguchi Memorial Institute to ensure that the country would not have to rely on foreign laboratories in future emergencies.
After the unfortunate helicopter crash, we realised that we had to depend on other countries for further investigations of biological samples.
On that basis, the President directed that DNA testing machines be procured for the Noguchi Memorial Institute, he explained.
Minister Akandoh emphasised that the arrival of the new equipment will significantly enhance national research and diagnostic capabilities.
He stated that it will reduce reliance on laboratories abroad, equip Ghanas scientific institutions to respond promptly to health and forensic emergencies, and support ongoing research in medical sciences.",,Health, 26 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ghana-to-acquire-DNA-testing-machine-for-Noguchi-Memorial-Institute-2011033
How music in operating theatres reduces use of anaesthetic drugs - Report,"A new study has found that playing calming instrumental music during surgery can significantly reduce the amount of anaesthetic drugs patients require and improve their overall recovery.
The peer-reviewed research, conducted at Lok Nayak Hospital and Maulana Azad Medical College in India, examined 56 patients aged between 18 and 65 who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a common keyhole procedure to remove the gallbladder.
The study, published in the journal Music and Medicine, ran from March 2023 to January 2024 and explored how music might reduce anaesthetic needs and perioperative stress.
'Vasectomies do not affect erections or sexual pleasure' - Doctor
Laparoscopic gallbladder removal typically lasts under an hour and involves a combination of drugs to induce sleep, block pain, erase memory of the procedure, and relax muscles. Patients commonly receive propofol, which causes unconsciousness within seconds and allows for a quick, clear-headed recovery.
Explaining the motivation behind the research, senior anaesthesia specialist and certified music therapist Dr Farah Husain said modern anaesthesia aims to enable fast, smooth recovery.
Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert, and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed, she said.
The primary goal of the study was to compare total propofol usage between patients who listened to music during surgery and those who did not.
All patients received the same combination of drugs and wore noise-cancelling headphones, but only half listened to music.
They were allowed to choose between two Indian instrumental pieces, with many selecting a flute composition combining the Hindustani ragas Yaman and Kirwani for its soothing tones.
Results showed a marked difference. Patients who listened to music required 6.7 mg of propofol per kilogram per hour, compared with 7.86 mg in the control group, a statistically significant reduction. They also needed fewer additional doses of fentanyl, the opioid used to manage sudden spikes in pain-related responses.

The study further disclosed that the bodys stress reaction to surgery was significantly lower among music recipients.
Postoperative cortisol levels averaged 417 IU/ml in the music group, compared with 536 IU/ml among those who did not listen to music.
Researchers also noted that patients exposed to music experienced smoother awakenings from anaesthesia and reported higher satisfaction levels 24 hours after their procedures.

NHIS uncapped with prompt release of funds into NHIS accounts - Akandoh,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has announced that the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) has been uncapped.
According to him, beyond the NHIS being uncapped, the release of funds allocated to the scheme has become swift and prompt, thereby enhancing the countrys healthcare sector.
NHIA projects over 120% tariff increase to strengthen healthcare delivery in 2026
The minister disclosed this while presenting his submission on the floor of Parliament on Tuesday, November 25, 2025.
One of the policy directives, one of the instructions when His Excellency the President was sworn in was the fact that the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) must be uncapped. Mr Speaker, as I speak to you now, the National Health Insurance Scheme has been uncapped. Not only has it been uncapped, now there is prompt release of funds into the National Health Insurance Fund, he said.
To demonstrate the swift release of funds, Akandoh explained that officials sometimes have to call service providers to come for their claims.
He further noted that service providers no longer issue threats to withdraw their services, attributing this change to the prompt disbursement of funds, which he said has eliminated delays in the payment of claims.
Mr Speaker, as I speak to you, we even sometimes have to call service providers to come for their claims. The issue of threat of withdrawal of services due to non-payment of claims are long gone, he continued.
Akandoh, who is also the Member of Parliament for Juaboso, stated that all these achievements have been accomplished by the government within a year, commending the leadership of President
John Dramani Mahama
.
He added that confidence in the NHIS has been boosted, leading to increased public trust and reliance on the scheme.
In a matter of one year, in fact less than one year, the active coverage of the National Health Insurance has grown from 18 million to almost more than 20 million in less than one year and we are looking at about 60 % coverage of the national health insurance.

UHAS Alumni Association highlights critical role of sports medicine in national development,"The University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) Alumni Association has successfully hosted its second annual Alumni Lecture, featuring a historic homecoming as an alumnus returned to deliver the keynote address.
The event, held under the theme Revolutionizing Sports Medicine in Ghana: A Multi-Faceted Approach, underscored the growing significance of specialized healthcare in sports.
In her welcome address, Professor Lydia Aziato, Vice-Chancellor of UHAS, emphasised the strategic importance of the universitys focus on sports medicine.
Today's topic is very relevant to the School of Sports and Exercise Medicine, she stated.
We are not training people to become footballers or physical education teachers. We are training healthcare professionals who can take care of people within the sports space.
Professor Aziato further highlighted the comprehensive nature of the training provided, noting that it covers the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of injuries and illnesses related to physical activity. She stressed the practical competencies being developed.
When something happens on the field whether it is an emergency, a fracture, muscle injury, or joint injury our graduates will know what to do as sports and exercise medicine professionals.
The keynote address was delivered by Dr Eric Tetteh Ayertey (MD, MSc Sports & Exercise Science), marking a major milestone as the first UHAS alumnus to serve as keynote speaker at the lecture series.
Describing his return as a homecoming, Dr Ayertey reiterated that sports medicine lies at the heart of Ghanas sporting fortunes and Ghanas future.
In his presentation, he expanded on the scope of sports medicine, stating that Sport and Exercise Medicine is not simply about treating injuries. It is the very scientific foundation of athletic performance and community well-being.
He also highlighted his pioneering work in anti-doping, including the development of African footballs first anti-doping manual for U-15 players and the creation of the CAF Anti-Doping Ambassador Program.
Im happy to see our youth athletes now equipped with knowledge of what to take and what not to take, he noted, ensuring that their performance is not short-chained by substances that will affect their well-being.
The event was chaired by Mama Bobi III, Queen of Bake, Ho Bankoe, Asogli State, who commended the Alumni Association for creating platforms that expand not only our knowledge but also our imagination about what is possible for Ghanas health and sports sectors.

Egyapa Mercer clashes with Garu MP on TV over Ghana's E-Health future,"A lawyer and a doctor locked horns on live television on Tuesday over the direction of Ghanas e-health system, sparking a heated debate about the countrys transition from a privately built platform to a government-owned one.
Former Sekondi MP and lawyer Andrew Kofi Egyapa Mercer clashed with Dr Thomas Anaba, MP for Garu and a medical doctor, on Metro TVs Good Morning Ghana hosted by Moro Awudu.
The argument centred on the governments decision to phase out the Light Wave-developed LHIMS platform in favour of the state-owned GHIMS, which is currently being piloted.
Dr Anaba argued that GHIMS is giving hospitals a smoother, more reliable experience compared with LHIMS, which he said had long been plagued by technical difficulties. He maintained that the governments system, though still rolling out, was already proving more user-friendly for health workers.
Mercer pushed back, insisting LHIMS had been functioning well until the Ministry of Health terminated Light Waves contract.
He accused the sector minister,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, of cutting ties with the company without providing a clear and defensible reason, despite the system already being in use in teaching hospitals and mental health facilities across the country.
He stressed that issues raised by hospitals could have been resolved through routine extensions of the contract and technical adjustments, rather than abandoning the platform entirely.
Mercer also questioned the ministrys claims about the cost of the contract and whether any proper assessment had been done before discontinuing it.
Dr Anaba countered that the ministry had laid out the facts and that Parliaments concern should be whether hospitals are receiving the services they are paying for.
The government intends to standardise electronic medical records nationwide, but disagreements over cost, performance and accountability remain unresolved.",,Health, 25 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Egyapa-Mercer-clashes-with-Garu-MP-on-TV-over-Ghana-s-E-Health-future-2010954
NHIA projects over 120% tariff increase to strengthen healthcare delivery in 2026,"The National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has announced that healthcare providers across Ghana are set to receive significantly increased financial support from January 2026, as the Authority prepares to implement a projected 120% upward adjustment in service tariffs.
According to the NHIA, the revised tariffs  among the most comprehensive reforms to Ghanas health financing system in recent years  will only take effect after formal approval from the Minister for Health, in line with statutory requirements.
The adjustment is expected to improve service delivery, enhance the sustainability of health facilities, and boost the overall patient experience under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).
Addressing health sector leaders from the Volta and Oti Regions at a regional training programme, Dr Senanu Kwesi Djokoto, Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Operations, speaking on behalf of the NHIA Chief Executive Officer, commended the Independent Clinical Experts Group for developing evidence-based tariffs that reflect the actual cost of healthcare services.
He explained that although the headline increment is 180%, the effective increase in claims reimbursements will average at least 120%, depending on the service mix provided by each facility.
Dr Djokoto attributed the breakthrough to the governments decision to uncap the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which has made an additional GH3.4 billion available for improved healthcare delivery.
The uncapping of the NHIF by His Excellency President John Dramani Mahama gives us the fiscal space to implement the reviewed tariffs, roll out the Free Primary Healthcare programme, and dedicate resources to the Ghana Medical Trust Fund for chronic disease support.
Dr Djokoto also raised concerns about the persistence of illegal charges in some health facilities.
He stressed that with the introduction of realistic tariffs, the NHIA will step up its enforcement measures, noting that a task force commissioned by NHIA CEO, Dr Victor Asare Bampoe, identified tariff alignment as a key tool in eliminating unauthorised payments.
Healthcare leaders at the training welcomed the impending reforms, describing them as timely and necessary.
Rev Prof. Adukwei Hesse, a World Bank consultant on the tariff review process, described the new structure as comprehensive and consistent with global best practices.
Similarly, Dr Isaac Koranteng, a Consultant Obstetrician at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, expressed optimism that the revised tariffs will reduce illegal co-payments, restore provider confidence, and enhance patient welfare.
The NHIA will continue its nationwide regional engagements to ensure health facility managers and frontline staff fully understand the implications of the new tariff regime ahead of its rollout.",,Health, 25 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/NHIA-projects-over-120-tariff-increase-to-strengthen-healthcare-delivery-in-2026-2010848
NDC rejects calls for renovation of Akim Oda Government Hospital,"The Akim Oda Government Hospital has not had any significant upgrades since its founding more than a century ago, and the call for its redevelopment has been turned down by the ruling New Democratic Congress (NDC).
Recall that Alexander Akwasi Acquah, the Member of Parliament for the Akim Oda constituency, has advocated for the Oda Hospital to be urgently upgraded and renovated to improve healthcare delivery and satisfy patients' increasing needs.
Commenting on the 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy, the MP expressed concerns that the money allocated in the budget for the construction of new medical facilities in Bole and Shama should instead be used to renovate some of the nation's older hospitals, such as the Oda Government Hospital.
He said, ""Bole has a district hospital, and so why are we going to do a new hospital in Bole? It is the home of the President, so we can understand. But, the difference between the ex-President Nana Addo and the current President H.E. John Mahama. The Kyebi Hospital is one of the oldest hospitals in Ghana, but Nana Akufo-Addo did not build a new hospital; he only rehabilitated that hospital, so we think that Bole Hospital can be rehabilitated so that the funding can be sent to Akim Oda Government Hospital.""
However, Yusif Sulemana, the Member of Parliament for Bole Bamboi, said that the request for repair works at the Oda Hospital cannot be granted because the development of the new health facility in Bole was already finalised. According to him, the Minister of Health is already in the area acquiring land for the project's construction.
""For your information, the Minister of Health is on his way to Bole to take possession of lands for the construction of the Bole District Hospital,"" Yusif Sulemana said.
Aside from the Bole and Shama District Hospitals, the government wants to build six new regional hospitals, finish ten existing Agenda 111 projects, and reopen the renovated La General Hospital to boost healthcare access throughout the country.
Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, Minister for Finance, stated in the 2026 budget that the projects are part of a national health infrastructure development program within the Mahama administration's health reform objective.", Nana Yaw Prekoh,Health, 24 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/NDC-rejects-calls-for-renovation-of-Akim-Oda-Government-Hospital-2010771
'Vasectomies do not affect erections or sexual pleasure' - Doctor,"Medical practitioner Dr (Med) Akua Gyenimaa Mills Danso has debunked fears that vasectomies reduce mens sex drives or impair their ability to get and maintain an erection.
Speaking in an interview with The Mirror, she stressed that a vasectomy has no negative impact on a mans sexual performance, desire, or enjoyment.
There is very little evidence of any significant long-term side effects. Vasectomy does not cause cancer, does not make you impotent, and does not reduce sexual strength or pleasure. You can enjoy sex the same way you used to, she explained.
Erectile Dysfunction: The silent struggle affecting Ghanaian men  What you need to know
What a Vasectomy is
A vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure in which the vas deferens, the tubes that transport sperm from the testes, are cut or sealed. This prevents sperm from mixing with semen during ejaculation, making pregnancy impossible. Men still ejaculate normally; the semen simply contains no sperm.
The procedure typically lasts about 30 minutes, and doctors may provide pain medication or scrotal support to ease discomfort.
Sex life after vasectomy
According to Dr Mills Danso, men can resume normal physical activities, including sex, within a week.
You can enjoy sex the same way you used to, even after the procedure, she stated.
However, she cautioned that vasectomy does not protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
A vasectomy does not protect you against HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). It only prevents pregnancy, so be sure to use condoms to prevent and protect against the spread of STIs, she noted.
Recovery and follow-up
Healing is quick because the incision is small. By the third day, you can see visible progress, Dr Mills Danso said.
After the procedure, couples are advised to use condoms for at least three months.
After that period, we ask you to do a semen analysis test so we can confirm that there are no active sperm in the semen. Once the results show that you are completely cleared, you can continue having sex without worrying about pregnancy, she explained.
World Vasectomy Day
World Vasectomy Day is marked annually on the third Friday of November. This years commemoration fell on November 21, 2025.
The initiative encourages men to take active roles in family planning, highlighting vasectomy as a safe, simple, and effective method while promoting shared responsibility in reproductive health.

Cancel nursing trainee allowance; use it to finance infrastructure  Yaw Sarpong,"Deputy General Secretary of the United Party (UP), Nana Yaw Sarpong, has called on the government to reallocate funds currently used for nursing training allowances to improve health sector infrastructure.
He believes that the government can use the financial provisions for nursing trainees to support the overall health sector development.
He questioned the rationale behind providing allowances to trainee nurses while students pursuing university degrees do not receive similar financial support.
I dont understand why we should be paying allowances to nursing and teacher training students. Why is it that a university student doesnt receive an allowance, but those in training colleges do? he asked on Angel TV.
Sarpong argued that the GH470 million budget allocation specifically for nursing trainee allowances could be better spent on constructing roads and advancing projects outlined in the Agenda 111 initiative.
This GH470 million being given as allowances could be redirected towards essential infrastructure, such as roads and development projects in Agenda 111, he added.",,Health, 22 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Cancel-nursing-trainee-allowance-use-it-to-finance-infrastructure-Yaw-Sarpong-2010564
"Over 19,000 people living with HIV in Bono Region as new infections surge - GAC","Over 19,000 persons in the Bono Region are living with HIV and AIDS, according to the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Technical Coordinator of the Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC), Ahmed Ibrahim Bambila.
According to him, the region also recorded 875 new HIV infections.
He described the figures as alarming, urging stronger, coordinated interventions to tackle the underlying causes to prevent further spread.
Bambila spoke during the inauguration of the Bono Regional Committee of the Ghana AIDS Commission (RECCOM) in Sunyani on Thursday, November 20, 2025.
The newly inaugurated 9-member committee, chaired by Bono Regional Minister Joseph Addae Akwaboa, is expected to lead and coordinate HIV-related programmes in the region to curb infections and enhance care.
Bambila noted that several factors continued to drive HIV transmission in the region, including low condom use, multiple sexual partners, stigma and discrimination, inadequate sexual health education, migration, transactional sex, and limited access to HIV services.
According to the 2024 Regional HIV Estimates, the Bono Regions HIV prevalence stood at 2.22 percent among persons aged 15 to 49, higher than the national average.
Bambila urged community actors, health institutions, civil society groups, and traditional authorities to intensify education and advocacy to reduce stigma, promote safe sexual practices, and improve access to testing and treatment.",,Health, 22 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Over-19-000-people-living-with-HIV-in-Bono-Region-as-new-infections-surge-GAC-2010517
'Collect receipts to close revenue gaps - Chief Accountant,"Richlove Wiafe Duffour, Chief Accountant at the Mental Health Authority, has urged taxpayers to demand and collect receipts to tackle the loopholes in the nations revenue generation.
We are all contributing to the loopholes, she stated, saying collecting receipts on taxes, fees and tolls would greatly bring the situation under control, and thereby strengthen public revenue collection.
Duffour gave the advice when she spoke on training on financial management in Accra on Thursday, as part of a three-day conference of the Agency, underway in Accra.
The conference has brought together regional managers to review coverage outputs, examine thematic reporting and discuss operational challenges affecting newsgathering and dissemination.
It further sought to assess the Agencys performance over the past year, and develop strategies to strengthen its operations for 2026 and beyond.
Mrs Duffour insisted that failure to demand or collect receipts on taxes, fees and tolls paid for public services was an inappropriate practice that partly fueled corruption, affecting the nations revenue mobilization.
She cited that: You remember at the time we were paying the road tolls, some of us will not even border to collect receipts when we pay the tolls. So, you see we are our own problems.
Duffour entreated the Agency managers to endeavour to adhere to the Public Financial Management Act whenever they spend public resources in order not to find themselves in trouble.
She took the participants through the GIFMIS modules and expenditure process, and asked the Agency to avoid the temptation of borrowing without the warrant to do so, and also endeavour to keep records and retire their imprest on time.",,Health, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Collect-receipts-to-close-revenue-gaps-Chief-Accountant-2010471
Yalwa youth hold health walk to raise awareness on substance abuse,"Hajia Aisha Community Service (HACS), in partnership with Yalwa Youth, on November 16, 2025, organised a community-wide health walk aimed at campaigning against substance abuse. The event took place in Yalwa, a suburb of Abossey Okai in the Greater Accra Region.
The walk formed part of activities marking this years Maulid (the birth of Prophet Muhammad) celebration and was held under the auspices of the Abossey Okai Zongo Yalwa Chief, Sarki Mohammed Aliyu Atiku Bashar, the Mukhtar Adam Foundation, and the Hajia Aisha Community Centre.
Held on the theme Safeguarding the Future of Our Youth, the health walk brought together residents of Yelwa and surrounding communities.
The initiative sought to educate the public on the dangers of drug and substance abuse, particularly among young people.
Officials from the Greater Accra Narcotics Control Commission (NCC) and mental health professionals also participated, engaging residents on the impacts of drug misuse and mental health issues.
Speaking after the walk, Abdul Aziz Ali, Acting Deputy Regional Commander of the NCC, urged community members to view the fight against substance abuse as a collective responsibility.
He noted that many people downplay the importance of the fight because they believe they are not directly affected.
However, he stressed that substance abuse influences communities through increased crime, theft, and the likelihood of more youth being drawn into drug use.
Aziz warned that anyone found in possession of illegal substances risks a fine of GH5,000, a six-month prison term, or both.
He also cautioned against the misuse of everyday medicines such as paracetamol and doctor-prescribed drugs, describing it as an overlooked form of drug abuse.
He encouraged residents to follow medical instructions strictly and avoid self-prescribing or recommending drugs to others.
A Senior Nursing Officer at the Pantang Hospital, Zuneru Zakari, advised parents to monitor their children closely and seek medical help immediately when they notice behavioural changes.
He highlighted the psychological effects associated with substance use and stressed the need for early intervention.
The Gimbiya of Yalwa, Hajia Aisha Zakaria, called on Zongo youth across the country to avoid drug abuse and focus on activities that promote development within their communities.
She described the rising cases of substance abuse among Zongo youth as a national crisis threatening Ghanas human capital development.
She expressed concern that many promising young people with great potential are being lost to drug addiction.
Hajia Aisha also condemned the involvement of some women in drug peddling and urged them to desist from the practice for the sake of their families and communities.", Muhammed Faisal Mustapha,Health, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Yalwa-youth-hold-health-walk-to-raise-awareness-on-substance-abuse-2010431
No Ghanaian medical data stored outside the country - Lightwave tells health minister,"Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions Limited has rejected what it describes as false and misleading claims made by the Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, regarding the management of Ghanas National E-Healthcare Programme and the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS).
According to a report by peacefmonline.com, Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions made the remarks in a statement released in Accra.
The fully Ghanaian-owned technology firm stated that the Ministers recent comments made in Parliament on October 28, 2025, and later at the Presidential Accountability Series on October 29 suggesting that Ghanas medical data was controlled from India, were not just incorrect but could harm public confidence in the country's digital health achievements.
Lightwave stressed that all healthcare data generated through LHIMS is stored on the Ministry of Healths own servers at its headquarters in Accra.
The company clarified that its role is limited to providing licensed software for data management, while the government retains full ownership and control of all records.
The healthcare data of Ghanaians is the property of the Government of Ghana and is stored within the Ministry of Healths servers in Accra, the statement said, calling the Ministers remarks false and unfortunate.
The company felt it necessary to respond publicly to stop misinformation from damaging trust in a system that has been developed and implemented since 2016.
Project history and contract structure
Lightwave detailed the projects history, starting with Phase One in 2016 under the then  former President
John Dramani Mahama
, which cost US$6 million and connected 23 health facilities in the Central Region.
Lightwave Contract Saga: Okoe Boye challenges Mintah Akandoh over fine details
Following this success, the Ministry of Health signed a second contract in March 2019 valued at US$100 million to expand the system to 950 facilities across the country.
The company explained that the contract price was not spread evenly across all facilities but weighted based on the complexity of each type of institution.
Teaching and regional hospitals required much larger investments, while health centers needed less infrastructure.
Lightwave E-Healthcare dismisses health minister's claims over National E-Health project
For instance, the four teaching hospitals alone accounted for 21 percent of the contract cost, while all 646 health centers together made up only 17 percent.
By December 2024, Lightwave had installed systems in all four teaching hospitals, six regional hospitals, and 243 district and other hospitals totaling 72 percent of the contract value and justifying the US$77 million (77 percent) disbursed by the Ministry.
Lightwave attributed project delays to constant payment delays and administrative hurdles. While payments were supposed to be made within 36 days of invoice submission, the company often waited between five and twenty months, creating significant financial pressure.
COVID-19 further affected rollout plans. Training sessions had to be reduced, facility space was limited, and global supply chain issues led to unpredictable delays in equipment delivery.
Ghanas temporary port closures added to the delays. Although the Ghana Health Service provided a prioritized facility list in 2023, Lightwave noted that a 12-month contract extension was delayed for nearly six months because the revised rollout list was not sent out on time.
Financial and equipment issues addressed
Despite these challenges, the company continued to provide support services even after the contract officially expired on December 31, 2024, without renewal and without payment for additional work done throughout 2025. Lightwave also rejected claims that it supplied poor-quality or insufficient hardware.
The company stated that all equipment met or exceeded contractual standards, and any changes were approved under the contracts substantial equivalence clause.
No facility or the Ministry reported issues with the hardware
In response to a claim about laptop shortages, Lightwave clarified that the contract required 9,544 laptops, not 13,172 and that 7,060 had already been delivered, with the rest set for facilities yet to be rolled out.
The company also referenced a meeting in September 2025 where the Minister instructed Lightwave to submit invoices for eight months of outstanding payments contradicting his public statement that there were no arrears.
Legal steps and call for objective review
Through its solicitors, Messrs Lord and Lords Legal Practice, Lightwave has requested arbitration and copies of all investigation reports related to the LHIMS project.
The company believes this is essential for protecting patient data and ensuring the continuity of e-health services across the country.
Reaffirming its commitment to Ghanas digital health transformation, Lightwave called for a fair, evidence-based review of the National E-Healthcare Programme one free from political rhetoric and data misinterpretation.

"Safe Water Network Ghana marks World Toilet Day 2025, calls for stronger action on sanitation","Safe Water Network Ghana (SWN) has joined the global community to commemorate World Toilet Day 2025, calling for renewed commitment to expand access to safe toilets and improve sanitation nationwide.
This years observance, marked on November 19, 2025, under the theme Well Always Need the Toilet, highlights the critical need to protect and invest in sanitation systems as communities face increasing pressure from population growth, infrastructure gaps, and climate change.
In a statement, SWN underscored that sanitation remains an essential human need and not a privilege. Despite progress made over the years, many households and institutions across the country continue to struggle with access to clean and reliable sanitation services, largely due to limited water supply.
Through its work to expand safe, affordable, and reliable water services, SWN is helping to bridge the sanitation gap, particularly in underserved communities.
The organization has so far extended piped water connections to more than 15,000 households, schools, clinics, and small businesses across Ghana, reaching over 600,000 people.
These improved water systems are enabling communities to maintain cleaner environments, strengthen public health, and build resilience against climate-related challenges.
Safe water and sanitation are inseparable. Every piped connection we deliver brings us closer to a future where every household and institution can maintain clean, dignified, and sustainable sanitation, said Charles Nimako, Country Director of Safe Water Network Ghana.
As part of World Toilet Day 2025, SWN reaffirmed its commitment to working closely with government, private-sector partners, and local communities to accelerate national efforts toward universal access to safe water and sanitation.
The organisation also expressed appreciation to its partnersthe Government of Ghana, Stone Family Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, One Foundation, Helmsley Charitable Trust, and Uptime Globalfor their continued support in driving progress toward improved water and sanitation outcomes.

Watch as children with cancer receive unforgettable surprise at Korle-Bu,"The children at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital received an unforgettable surprise when Leonardo Muylaert, the internationally acclaimed Brazilian Superman, visited the pediatric cancer ward during his first mission to Ghana.
Dressed in his signature Superman suit, Leonardo brought more than just the look of a hero; he brought the heart of one. Moving quietly from bed to bed, he knelt beside each child, offering warm hugs, listening to their stories, and reminding them that hope is powerful even on the hardest days. The children lit up with excitement as he held their hands, took photos with them, and spoke words of encouragement to their families.
For many of the young patients, this moment was a boost of courage. Parents and nurses described the atmosphere as joyful, comforting, and unexpectedly healing. His presence filled the ward with laughter, wonder, and renewed strength.

Here is the percentage of adult Ghanaians who cannot afford healthy meals,"Professor Anna Lartey, a nutrition expert at the University of Ghana, has disclosed that up to 65 percent of adult Ghanaians cannot afford healthy meals.
According to a report by graphic.com.gh. Prof Anna Lartey made this known at a recent sensitisation workshop in Accra titled Beyond the Dialogues: Tracking Ghanas Commitments to Transform Its Food Systems.
""Up to 65 per cent of adult Ghanaians are unable to afford a healthy diet daily. The recommended healthy diets consist of half a plate of vegetables and fruit, a quarter of a plate of carbohydrates, and another quarter of protein,"" she noted.
One-day sensitization workshop on food systems ends in Accra
Prof Lartey said healthy foods are often more expensive than junk foods, which drives many people to choose the latter.
She pointed out that fruits and vegetables cost significantly more than sugar-laced drinks and fast foods, which are widely available on almost every street corner.
She warned that such unhealthy eating habits have serious consequences, citing them as major contributors to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and other health issues in Ghana.
According to Prof Lartey, who also serves as Project Co-Principal Investigator, the food environment heavily influences food choices, and the current environment does not support healthy options.
Ghanas food landscape set for a fresh taste with much-anticipated 'Gastro Feastival'
She stressed that, Ghana made several commitments to improve its food systems to ensure better health outcomes. We have had the dialogues; now it is time for action. We must ask ourselves what steps are being taken to fulfil these commitments.
The workshop was organised by the University of Ghana School of Public Health, with support from the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and the Ghana Statistical Services (GSS), the report said.

"Here's why vapes, ecigarettes, shisha are deadlier and illegal in Ghana","What many young people see as a trendy, portable, and safer alternative to smoking is, in reality, far more dangerous.
Across Accra and other cities, vaping and shisha lounges are becoming popular spots, especially among the youth.
Older users too are increasingly turning to ecigarettes and vapes, believing them to be a stylish, less harmful substitute for traditional cigarettes.
But the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) says this perception is dangerously wrong.
Jemima Odonko, Head of the Tobacco Products Department at the FDA, has categorically stated that ecigarettes, vapes, and shisha are illegal in Ghana.
Speaking to
GhanaWeb
during a oneday training on Illicit Financial Flows organised by the Financial Intelligence Centre in Accra, she explained that these devices are made from synthetically produced nicotine rather than natural tobacco, making them unregulated and unsafe.
More young women in Ghana smoke shisha than their male counterparts  Survey
These vapes and ecigarettes are illicit products. They are not allowed under our laws, she stressed.
Beyond their illegality, the health risks are staggering.
Studies show that vaping increases the risk of lung injury, heart disease, and nicotine addiction, with evidence linking it to longterm respiratory problems.
Ordinary tobacco already contains more than 7,000 toxic chemicals, including 70 known carcinogens that directly cause cancer.
Shisha, on the other hand, which has become a social trend among Ghanas youth, is even more alarming and research reveals that smoking shisha for just one hour is equivalent to smoking 200 sticks of cigarettes.
A 2024 nationwide study found that 44 percent of young women smokers aged 1829 actively engage in shisha, compared to just 6.6 percent of men.
Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tobacco use kills over 8 million people every year, including 1.3 million nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.
The FDA insists that no tobacco or nicotine product can be sold in Ghana without regulatory approval, which ensures health warnings and safety requirements are displayed.
Odonko urged the public, especially young people, to resist the lure of vapes and shisha.
Protect your health, protect your future. These products are not only illegal, they are deadly, she said.

Infection Prevention and Control has been elevated to a national strategy, and the HPV vaccination for girls has been rolled out nationwide, the Minister said.
To promote gender equity in the health sector, Dr Forson explained that a National Health Sector Gender Policy was launched, promoting gender equity in workforce participation and access to care. The Ministry has also strengthened global partnerships with GAVI, Pfizer, and the UK Trade Envoy to expand health financing and innovation.
Key infrastructure and capacity developments include the establishment of the National Cleft Centre at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) and the development of forensic laboratories for DNA and toxicology analysis.
The National Ambulance Service also trained 500 Emergency Medical Technicians, while 6,000 youth were trained as first-aid responders.
The Minister further noted that the Centre for Plant Medicine Research validated the long-term efficacy of four herbal medicines, reinforcing Ghanas leadership in traditional medicine research.
Public health surveillance remained active, successfully containing outbreaks of Mpox, meningitis, and cholera. Reconstruction of the La General Hospital is 33 percent complete, with additional work underway on hospitals in Juaboso and Sandema, as well as five CHPS compounds. The Kpone Municipal Hospital and the KOFIH Centre were commissioned in 2025.
Looking ahead, Dr Forson stated, In 2026, Government will continue rebuilding the La General Hospital, establish six regional hospitals, expand CHPS compounds, and modernise medical equipment nationwide. He added that nursing allowances had been fully paid, 13,500 nurses placed on payroll, and admission fees for trainee nurses halved.
Health training institutions expanded programmes, adding 930 new residents, 2,104 specialist nurses, and several newly accredited teaching centres. Regulatory agencies such as the Pharmacy Council and HeFRA advanced digital integration, while SafeCare accreditation increased to 34 facilities. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) also identified 232 unlicensed mortuaries, issued provisional licences, and trained 800 attendants in safe practices.
The Minister concluded that in 2026, the Ministry will advance the Free Primary Health Care agenda, scale up local manufacturing, and modernise digital claims and fraud detection systems to improve efficiency and accountability.

Ghana Library Board partners Sanitopia CIC to build 157 modern sanitation facilities,"The Ghana Library Board (GhLB) has partnered with UK-based social enterprise Sanitopia CIC to construct 157 modern sanitation facilities across libraries in Ghana, a transformative step aimed at improving hygiene, health, and access to quality education.
The collaboration aligns with Ghanas commitment to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 4 (Quality Education).
According to lawyer Nana Yaa Owusu Aduome, a trustee of Sanitopia CIC, the partnership is not just about infrastructure but about empowering children and communities with safe, clean learning spaces.
This initiative is about giving our children the safe, clean environment they need to learn, grow, and thrive without fear of disease or discomfort, she said.
She emphasised that access to proper sanitation is a matter of dignity, especially for young girls, and plays a crucial role in keeping children in school.
No child should have to choose between education and dignity. By joining hands with the Ghana Library Board, we are not just building toilets; we are building the future of Ghana, she added.
At the launch event, Alhassan Ziblim Betintiche, Director-General of the Ghana Library Authority, described libraries as living community hubs that must offer more than just books, they must also provide safe and healthy spaces for learning. Access to information, literacy, and a conducive learning environment are fundamental rights every Ghanaian deserves, he said.
Betintiche highlighted several initiatives by the Authority to make learning accessible to all, including the Ghana Library App, a zero-rated app available on MTN and Telecel that allows free access to e-books and learning materials; an expanded network of 139 public libraries across the country; and extended opening hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in selected libraries to support learners and families.
We are deeply grateful to Sanitopia CIC for this partnership, which aligns with our vision to build libraries that not only promote literacy but also safeguard health and dignity, he noted.
The Chairman and President of Sanitopia CIC, Richard Kojo Acheampong, Esq., described the partnership as a historic step toward addressing sanitation challenges in educational environments nationwide.
Under the partnership agreement, Sanitopia CIC will construct 150 sanitation facilities for existing public libraries and 150 new library facilities as part of a larger plan to build 2,000 toilets across Ghana within five years.
This project is not merely about infrastructure; its about health, dignity, and education, Acheampong said.
He explained that access to sanitation contributes to multiple Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by reducing preventable diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, and SDG 5 (Gender Equality) by providing safe and private sanitation facilities for women and girls.
Sanitopia CIC also aims to; Build community-centered sanitation facilities that are affordable, safe, and sustainable; Convert waste into biogas and fertilizer, promoting environmental and economic benefits; and Train schools and communities to maintain and manage the facilities effectively.
The initiative highlights the critical link between education and public health. Organisers believe that no learning environment can thrive without proper hygiene.
Knowledge is power, Sanitopia CIC noted in a statement, but it cannot flourish if children are falling ill from preventable diseases caused by poor sanitation. Health and learning must go hand in hand.
When completed, the 157 sanitation facilities will serve as a national symbol of Ghanas progress toward a cleaner, healthier, and more inclusive society. The project also focuses on maintenance and hygiene education, ensuring that children and community members learn to sustain the facilities responsibly.
Sanitation is not just about construction; its about maintenance, responsibility, and behaviour change. We must educate as we build, said Nana Yaa Owusu Aduome.
Acheampong expressed appreciation to the Ghana Library Board, Khoshakis Ltd, Guarding Professionals Ltd, and the trustees of Sanitopia CIC for their partnership.
He also called on government agencies, corporate bodies, NGOs, and philanthropists, both in Ghana and abroad, to join the mission.
Great things happen when people come together for a cause greater than themselves. Together, we can build a Ghana where every child has access to clean sanitation, where dignity is restored, and where every library becomes a beacon of health and knowledge, he said.
Both institutions reaffirmed their shared commitment to promoting literacy, protecting public health, and fostering community development through collaboration and innovation.

Diabetes on the Rise in Ghana: Expert calls for lifestyle changes,"A public health physician at the 37 Military Hospital, Dr Ewura Adjoa Animah Ninoo, has raised concerns over the rising number of diabetes cases in Ghana.
According to a report by gbcghanaonline.com on November 13, 2025, Dr Ninoo said the condition has become one of the fastest-growing health issues in the country, driven largely by changing lifestyles and poor dietary habits among both young and older Ghanaians.
Currently, the prevalence of diabetes in Ghana is about seven to eight percent, but it keeps increasing by the day. This is why platforms like this are so important to create awareness and encourage lifestyle changes, she stated.
Experts warn of rising type 2 diabetes cases among Ghanaian children
Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the body either fails to produce insulin or cannot properly use the insulin it produces.
Insulin is a hormone that helps transfer glucose from the blood into cells to provide energy.
When insulin is ineffective, blood sugar levels rise while the body is starved of energy.
Dr Ninoo explained that there are two main types of diabetes: Type 1, which is mostly genetic and affects younger people, and Type 2, often caused by unhealthy lifestyles such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity.
Type 1 diabetes is usually found among younger people and is genetic. Type 2, on the other hand, is common in adults, especially those in their 30s and 40s, and is often linked to lifestyle choices, she said.
The physician emphasised that diabetes is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured but can be managed with medication, healthy eating, and regular medical checkups.
She warned that stopping treatment can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, liver problems, and amputations.
Treatment depends on the type of diabetes. Type 1 patients rely on insulin injections, while Type 2 patients are usually managed with oral medication, though some may require insulin in severe cases.
Ghana observes World Diabetes Day
Dr Ninoo also urged families to support diabetic relatives emotionally and physically, noting that managing the condition requires discipline and encouragement.
She advised Ghanaians to check their blood sugar regularly, eat balanced meals, exercise often, and avoid self-medication. Early detection, she said, can save lives.

Western Regional Minister inaugurates 9-member committee to strengthen HIV/AIDS fight,"Western Regional Minister, Joseph Nelson, on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, inaugurated a nine-member Regional Committee of the Ghana AIDS Commission (ReCCOM) to intensify efforts against the spread of HIV in the region.
The committee, established under Section 9 (2) of Act 938, will initially focus on reviewing comprehensive regional data to fully understand the scope of the ongoing fight against HIV.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Nelson emphasised the urgency of the matter, noting, The most significant asset of our region our human resources, which are essential for driving our industries, supporting our communities, and sustaining our families faces a profound threat. If we do not take decisive action now, this crisis will only deepen, particularly in light of the diminishing donor support that we currently experience.
He further stated, To confront this urgent issue, I am pleased to announce the establishment of the nine-member Regional Committee of the Ghana AIDS Commission (ReCCOM). The committee's first task will be to meticulously review our regional data to ensure we grasp the full extent of the challenges that lie ahead. The mandate before us is unequivocal: we must intensify our efforts, mobilize our resources, and reinvigorate our focus on prevention strategies.
Nelson called on all stakeholders including government agencies, civil society organizations, traditional leaders, the media, and the private sector to work collaboratively on this initiative.
We must unite to halt new infections, eliminate the stigma associated with HIV, and strengthen our systems for prevention, treatment, and care. Together, we can make a substantial impact in the fight against HIV/AIDS within our region, he indicated.
The latest data released by the Ghana AIDS Commission for 2024 paints a concerning picture of HIV in the Western Region, with 1,120 new infections recorded over the year.
This figure translates to an average of three new infections per day a rate that has remained largely unchanged over the past five years.

Rh null: The rarest blood type in the world,"Blood transfusions are a cornerstone of modern medicine, saving lives during surgeries and emergencies. But for people with extremely rare blood types, finding a compatible donor can be a matter of life and death.
One of the rarest blood types is Rh null, sometimes called golden blood'.
According to a report by meterotvonline.com on November 13, 2025, only about 50 people in the world are known to have it. Because of its rarity, people with Rh null blood are often advised to store their own blood for emergencies.
Professor Ash Toye from the University of Bristol said the blood type is also highly valuable for science and medical research.
Sickle Cell Disease: The silent killer
Blood types are determined by antigen markers on red blood cells that act like ID tags.
If a patient receives blood with antigens their body doesn't recognise, their immune system may attack it.
The main blood group systems are ABO and Rhesus (Rh). While O-negative is often considered a universal donor type, over 47 blood group systems and 366 known antigens exist, meaning reactions can still occur.
People with Rh null blood have none of the 50 Rh antigens, allowing their blood to safely match with almost any Rh type.
However, they can only receive Rh null blood themselves, which is extremely difficult to find.
""Donated blood will always be essential. But for people with rare blood, being able to grow more of their own blood would be life-changing,"" the report said.
Researchers are exploring gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR to create lab-grown Rh null or other universal blood types.
Scientists in the UK, US, Canada, and Spain have made progress by editing blood stem cells to remove antigen-producing genes, while the technology is promising, producing red blood cells outside the body remains challenging, as bone marrow provides complex signals needed for proper cell development.
15k Ghanaian babies born with sickle cell disease annually  Expert
For now, individuals with rare blood types depend on blood banks and research projects to collect and store their blood for emergencies.
Experts say lab-grown blood could one day provide a reliable solution for patients with rare blood types and improve emergency transfusions worldwide.

VAST advocates health taxes and accountability,"The Executive Director of Vision for Accelerated Sustainable Development (VAST-Ghana), a civil society organisation, Labram Musah, has called on the government, through the Ministry of Finance, to review upwards the excise tax rates on unhealthy products such as tobacco, alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), ultra-processed foods (UPFs), and other harmful products as part of a comprehensive fiscal and public health strategy.
According to him, by increasing excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol, SSB, and other health-harming products, Ghana can build a healthier, wealthier, er and more resilient future.
The health of Ghanaians is the foundation of the nations productivity, and no economic argument should be strong enough to undermine that, he said.
In a press statement, Musah noted that the Excise Duty (Amendment) Act, 2023, introduced an evidence-based approach to levying taxes on products that cause disproportionate harm to population health.
He explained that existing evidence shows excise taxes on such products are among the most cost-effective interventions available to governments.
Therefore, a review of these taxes would help to prevent and reduce harmful consumption, protect young people and low-income households, and mobilise predictable revenue to strengthen health systems overwhelmed by the rising tide of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
The call for tax reduction by industry actors is, therefore, misplaced and regressive as it represents a deliberate attempt to shift attention from public health imperatives to profit maximisation, he stated.
Musah urged the Ministry of Finance to remain steadfast in prioritising the health and well-being of Ghanaians above corporate interests, in order to achieve the healthcare policy objectives outlined by President John Dramani Mahama.
He cited the World Health Organisations Saving Lives, Spending Less report, which highlights the economic benefits of preventive health measures.
Every US$1 invested in tobacco control yields a US$7 return; every US$1 invested in alcohol control generates a US$9 return; and every US$1 invested in curbing unhealthy diets delivers up to a US$14 return. This demonstrates that strategic excise taxation and prevention measures are not only life-saving but also economically rewarding, he explained.
He stressed that every cedi lost through reduced excise rates would translate into thousands of preventable deaths, increased hospital admissions, and diminished workforce productivity.
The long-term sustainability of the health sector and the broader economy depends not on appeasing industry lobbyists but on reinforcing a tax system that internalises the true social cost of harmful products, he added.
To raise significant revenue for healthcare investment while reducing consumption of harmful products linked to chronic diseases, Musah proposed that the government increase excise taxes on harmful products such as tobacco, alcohol, and sugary drinks by 50 percent.
This, he said, would boost health sector funding and save lives amid dwindling donor support, underscoring the need for renewed domestic resource mobilisation to address Africas growing health challenges.
He further called for periodic tax adjustments indexed to inflation, coupled with strengthened enforcement and regional cooperation, to sustain the deterrent effect of such taxes and prevent cross-border leakages.
Musah also urged the government to reform the current excise tax structure to make it more effective and less susceptible to industry manipulation, tax avoidance, and evasion.
He recommended the implementation of a specific tax systembased on per stick for tobacco products and per content for alcoholand the introduction of an ad valorem excise tax on ultra-processed foods to discourage excessive consumption of unhealthy foods.
Additionally, he called for the adoption of a minimum pricing unit to set a threshold for all alcohol products, as part of broader efforts to protect public health and enhance accountability in Ghanas fiscal and health systems.",,Health, 12 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/VAST-advocates-health-taxes-and-accountability-2009210

Radiographers call for enhanced training and curriculum reforms,"The President of the Ghana Society of Radiographers (GSR), Dr Prince Rockson, has stressed the need for improved human resource capacity and enhanced training for radiography professionals to meet evolving global healthcare standards.
Speaking at the Hariet Duah inter-school quiz competition and the celebration of the 130th World Radiography Day in Accra over the weekend, Dr Rockson said that as medical imaging advances rapidly, Ghana requires highly trained professionals across specialized areas to deliver safe and efficient patient care.
It was on the home page; Celebrating the Power of Medical Imaging and the Radiographer behind the Image.
He noted that the current four-year radiography training in the country falls short of the level required to achieve imaging excellence.
According to him, some institutions have introduced pseudo-specializations at the first-degree level, a situation he described as inadequate for producing competent specialists.
The Ghana Society of Radiographers hopes that radiography institutions in Ghana urgently develop a harmonized curriculum in collaboration with the Allied Health Professions Council and the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission, he said.
Dr Rockson, who is also Togbe Kpegba Agbakpe I, Afetorfia of Taviefe Sreme, explained that such a move would pave the way for the recommended six-year radiography training system proposed by the West African Health Organization (WAHO).
He added that graduates from this advanced training structure will form the foundation for postgraduate specialization.
Dr Rockson said higher-level professionals would then be able to specialize in areas such as modality-specific imaging, image interpretation, research, teaching, administration, and other radiological sub-fields.
Touching on the significance of ongoing technological improvement in the profession, the GSR President said radiography continues to play a pivotal role in global medical practice and will remain crucial in shaping healthcare delivery in the years to come.
He also highlighted the invisible and sometimes potentially harmful nature of X-rays when improperly applied stressing that trained radiographers are required to carefully assess the risks, frequency, and dosage of radiation to ensure accurate diagnoses with minimal risk to patients.
A member of the Council of Elders of the Ghana Society of Radiographers (GSR) and lecturer at the University of Ghana, Professor William Antwi, paid tribute to the global radiography profession as Ghana joined the world to mark World Radiography Day.
He said the celebration honours Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, whose discovery of X-rays transformed medical practice, and recognizes radiographers whose work continues to save lives across Ghana and beyond.
Professor Antwi noted that radiographers play a crucial role in healthcare, turning invisible rays into life-saving diagnostic images. Every image we create brings clarity, supports healing, and saves lives. We are not just operators of machines; we are guardians of vision, partners in diagnosis, and pillars of modern healthcare, he stated.
Prof Antwi explained that the work of radiographers goes beyond imaging, describing it as illumination, since every scan reveals information hidden to the naked eye and guides critical medical decisions saying that radiographers efforts provide patients and clinicians with instruments of hope.
He commended Ghanaian radiographers for their resilience and professionalism in the face of challenges related to resource and technological constraints, adding that they continue to deliver quality service to hospitals and communities across the country.
Prof Antwi urged professionals to recommit to continuous learning, ethical conduct, teamwork, and mentorship to sustain the growth of the profession.
He emphasized the need to build a strong foundation for the next generation of radiographers to ensure continuous improvement in imaging services.
As we celebrate, let us nurture future practitioners with passion, ensuring that the light of our profession never dims. Together, we imagine the future of healthcare one patient, one scan, one act of service at a time, he added.
On his part, the National Organiser of the Ghana Society of Radiographers (GSR) and Director of Allied Health Services at the University of Ghana Medical Centre, George Nunoo, commended the growth of the radiography profession in Ghana as the country joined the world to mark World Radiography Day.
He said the Day offers an opportunity to honour radiographers globally and to reflect on their contributions to healthcare delivery. In Ghana, he noted, the celebrations focused on bringing professionals and students together through a quiz competition, professional engagement, and an assessment of the state of radiography education.
This marks our seventh event. We have previously held similar activities in Cape Coast and at the University of Ghana Medical Centre, he said. Our goal is to unite radiography students from diverse backgrounds so they understand each others fields and align with global standards.
He observed that radiography in Ghana had progressed significantly, moving from basic machine operators to highly trained specialists, including PhD holders such as the current GSR President. The perception of radiographers, he added, has evolved as the profession expands into advanced imaging areas.
According to Nunoo, the future of radiography in Ghana is promising, with more practitioners specializing in modalities such as MRI, CT, and interventional radiography.
He highlighted emerging fields such as cardiac CT and cardiac MRI, explaining that although cardiac MRI remains rare in Ghana, it is crucial for early detection of cardiovascular diseases.
Radiographers, he said, play an essential role in supporting doctors to identify and manage heart conditions through advanced imaging.
He encouraged radiographers to pursue further training and higher qualifications to keep pace with medical technology. X-rays, ultrasound, and MRI are important, but we must continue to elevate our practice and advance as a profession, he added.
World Radiography Day, marked globally on November 8, commemorates the discovery of X-rays by Professor Conrad Roentgen in 1895, a breakthrough that revolutionized medical practice.
The annual event emphasizes the important role of radiographers and promotes quality, safety, technological innovation, and public awareness of medical imaging.
The Ghana Society of Radiographers, the professional body for diagnostic radiographers, radiation therapists, and sonographers, continues to champion improved standards in radiological practice as part of its commitment to public health and professional advancement.

CHAG cautions against spiritual emptiness in Ghana's healthcare system,"The Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) has cautioned that efficiency without faith risks undermines healthcare, urging moral renewal to sustain compassion and ethics in health delivery.
At its annual conference in Koforidua, CHAG raised concerns over what it calls spiritual emptiness in the nations healthcare system, warning that hospitals risk becoming efficient but spiritually hollow.
Speaking at the conference themed: Sustaining Christian Identity, Values and Ethics in Health Systems Strengthening, the Executive Director, Dr Peter Kwame Yeboah, said almost eight million Ghanaians knock on our doors every year.
We provide compassionate, Christ-like care through 385 facilities across all 16 regions. Yet, we are beginning to see signs of moral fatigue among staff.
He cautioned that hospitals founded on prayer and compassion now would risk losing their spiritual foundation.
Our hospitals are becoming efficient, but spiritually empty, and that is not the foundation of our calling, he stressed.
Dr Yeboah highlighted CHAGs role in pioneering community-based health insurance schemes in the 1990s, which influenced Ghanas NHIS, adding, CHAG provides nearly one-third of the countrys healthcare services, particularly in communities often forgotten. We are the bridge between science and faith, compassion, and efficiency.
Delivering the keynote address, Apostle Eric Nyamekye, Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, reminded health professionals of their divine calling, saying, Every Christian in the health sector is performing a holy assignment. You are the salt and light in a world advancing medically but declining morally.
We live in an age of astonishing progress, yet millions still suffer needlessly. That is why we must heal not just the body, but the soul.
Health Minister Kwabena Mintah Akandoh commended CHAGs contribution, saying,
CHAG is more than a health provider; it is a custodian of faith, dignity, and humanity in our national health system.
He pledged the governments commitment under the upcoming Health Sector Medium-Term Development Plan (20262029) and policies such as the Free Primary Healthcare Policy.
Most Rev Joseph Afrifa Agyekum, Catholic Bishop of Koforidua, praised CHAG for delivering uninterrupted services, urging the Ministry of Health to keep health workers motivated.
The conference ended with a renewed call for moral and spiritual renewal in Ghanas health sector, emphasising that compassion and ethics must remain the foundation of care.",,Health, 11 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/CHAG-cautions-against-spiritual-emptiness-in-Ghana-s-healthcare-system-2009033
NHIA takes 'Operation Storm' to Bolgatanga township,"The Bolgatanga Municipal Office of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has stormed the Bolgatanga township, market and lorry stations to sensitise traders, drivers and members of the public on the MyNHIS software application.
The application, launched in November 2022 to eliminate the long queues often seen at National Health Insurance offices across the country, could be downloaded from Apple or Google Play Store for use by members of the public with their Ghana cards.
Clad in official T-shirts of the Authority in a float, the Municipal officers, supported by their colleagues from the Regional and surrounding District offices, moved into shops to sensitise traders, and distributed National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) subscriber handbooks to them.
The officials also took time to engage pedestrians and explained to them how to link their NHIS cards to their Ghana cards, and offered the opportunity for members of the public to enrol onto the scheme and renew their invalid cards at a designated set-up point at the main lorry station.
Roland Abane Ayine, the Bolgatanga Municipal Manager of the Authority, told journalists during the exercise that it was the desire of the NHIA to enrol everyone onto the scheme to benefit from its application and offers.
He said the Authoritys message was basically on the application, which allowed members of the public to link their Ghana card to the NHIS card via the short code *929#.
The message is on the MyNHIS App, the *929# linking the Ghana card to the health insurance card and, more importantly, the automatic renewal feature in the *929#, where clients are allowed to link their NHIS numbers to their Mobile Money numbers for renewal prompts so they can consent to it before the card is renewed, he said.
Ayine said some people only realised they had invalid NHIS cards in emergencies, owing to the hitherto non-existent automatic renewal feature, With this automatic renewal feature, forgetfulness to validate NHIS cards will be a thing of the past.
We are targeting over a thousand people. So far, we have renewed a lot of cards, and from the way we are moving around, we believe that by the end of the day, we will hit the target, the Municipal Manager noted.
Some members of the public in random interviews with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) on the exercise expressed excitement about the Authoritys initiative and recalled days of long queues at offices of the Authority, especially at the Bolgatanga Municipal Office, just to renew their cards, which affected their daily activities.
Cynthia Anafo, who had just renewed her card, told the GNA that the Authoritys initiative to set up a registration and renewal point as part of the Operation Storm made it simple and much easier for her to renew her card.
She thanked officials of the Authority and called for more such initiatives and engagements with members of the public.",,Health, 11 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/NHIA-takes-Operation-Storm-to-Bolgatanga-township-2009023
Ghana Digital Centres CEO settles hospital bills of stranded nursing mother,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Digital Centres Limited, Dzifa Gunu, has paid off the medical bills of a nursing mother who had been stranded for three months at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital after delivering her baby.
The mother, Doris Ametepey, a resident of Odorkor, had remained at the hospitals maternity ward for three months after being discharged because she was unable to clear her medical bills. Her situation worsened when her husband abandoned her and the newborn soon after delivery, leaving her helpless and confined to the ward.
Touched by her plight, Gunu made immediate arrangements for her bills to be settled, ensuring her prompt discharge and reunion with her family. The cash donation, made on behalf of the CEO by James Kanu Nartey-Oman, took place last Thursday at the hospital.
Receiving the support, a visibly emotional Ametepey expressed profound gratitude to  Gunu for what she described as a divine intervention.
I had no hope that any family member of mine could afford such huge medical bills. I kept praying for Gods help, and He has answered me through Mr Gunu, she said tearfully.
She recounted that she had delivered her baby through a caesarean section and had endured months of distress and uncertainty while confined to the hospital.
She described her ordeal as depressing and appealed to well-meaning individuals and organisations to come to the aid of other mothers in similar situations.
Presenting the donation, Nartey-Oman, who represented the CEO, commended the medical staff of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital for their compassion and continuous care for pregnant women and nursing mothers in need.
He noted that Gunus gesture formed part of his commitment to touching lives and promoting kindness and social responsibility beyond the digital sector.", Raissa Sambou,Health,  9 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ghana-Digital-Centres-CEO-settles-hospital-bills-of-stranded-nursing-mother-2008738
'Transfer him now!'  Eastern Region youth give Health Ministry 7-day ultimatum,"The Medical Director of the Eastern Regional Hospital, Dr Arko Akoto-Ampaw, is currently under fire following accusations of wrongdoing and administrative misconduct.
At a crowded press conference held in Koforidua on Friday, November 7, 2025, a youth group calling itself the Concerned Youth of the Reset Agenda  supporters of President John Dramani Mahamas Reset Agenda policy  issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to transfer Dr. Akoto-Ampaw from the hospital.
The group warned that failure by the authorities to act swiftly would compel them to enforce the Presidents Reset Agenda to normalize the situation at the hospital.
Clad in red armbands, the aggrieved youth accused Dr Akoto-Ampaw of defying a legitimate transfer directive and overstaying his post.
They argued that his continued stay at the facility undermines the governments efforts to inject new energy and accountability into the health sector.
According to the group, Dr Akoto-Ampaw has served as Medical Director for more than six years, far exceeding the standard tenure for such positions.
They alleged that despite being transferred under a national reshuffle of medical directors aimed at improving leadership and transparency, he has refused to comply.
The youth explained that Dr Akoto-Ampaw was granted a three-month grace period to settle his family before assuming his new posting  a period that has long expired. Yet, he continues to occupy the office unlawfully, they claimed.
They noted that the nationwide transfer exercise, initiated by the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, was intended to inject new leadership and align management with national efficiency goals.
However, confusion arose after a second letter reassigned the individual initially posted to replace Dr Akoto-Ampaw to the Hohoe Government Hospital, creating uncertainty around the succession process.
Following a meeting at the GHS headquarters, it was agreed that Dr Akoto-Ampaw would remain temporarily for three months  a condition he has since violated.
The group further emphasized that per the GHS directive, no medical director is supposed to serve more than a year at the same facility without transfer, stressing that Dr Akoto-Ampaws continued stay breaches policy and accountability standards.
They therefore issued a stern warning to the Director-General and the Ministry of Health to enforce the transfer directive without delay, insisting that no further extensions would be tolerated.
The youth accused Dr Akoto-Ampaw of lobbying influential persons to help him retain his position, allegedly boasting that the current GHS Director-General cannot remove him because he serves in an acting capacity and that he enjoys powerful backing.
The group also alleged financial improprieties and mismanagement under his administration, claiming that he has turned the hospital into a money-making venture for personal gain.
According to them, staff reports suggest that maintenance contracts funded by government are diverted to his associates, leading to inflated costs and missing items, including air conditioners and food meant for patients.
They further alleged that while the triage and emergency wards struggle with inadequate beds and basic consumables, Dr Akoto-Ampaw has chosen to fund his law education using hospital resources.
What policy in the Ghana Health Service permits a course of study with no direct benefit to the service to be sponsored with hospital funds? the group questioned, insisting that their claims are verifiable.
They added that Dr Akoto-Ampaw, together with several management members who have stayed at the facility for over six to twelve years, must be transferred immediately to prevent administrative stagnation and continued distractions.
The youth stated that they had initially exercised patience when the director requested time to relocate, but his continued defiance now suggests collusion with certain individuals in authority to subvert due process.
We assure all concerned that the youth will resist this by every lawful means necessary, the group warned. Any covert dealings between him and persons in power will soon be exposed.
The Concerned Youth of the Reset Agenda concluded by calling on President John Dramani Mahama, the Minister of Health, and the Eastern Regional Minister to intervene immediately, stressing that the growing frustration among the youth threatens to escalate if decisive action is not taken.", Kay Agbenyega,Health,  7 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Transfer-him-now-Eastern-Region-youth-give-Health-Ministry-7-day-ultimatum-2008555
Ghana's lab system must evolve from being reactive to predictive - Dr Akoriyea,"At the Sanctuary of Wind and Fire Assemblies of God Church in Accra, the nations medical laboratory professionals gathered on October 30, 2025, for the Annual National Congress of the Ghana Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists (GAMLS).
The event, themed Enhancing Laboratory Resilience: Combating Emerging Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) through Emerging Technologies, Collaboration and Research, brought together experts and policymakers determined to shape the next phase of Ghanas healthcare future.
Delivering the keynote address, Dr Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, Acting Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), underscored the indispensable role of medical laboratory scientists in safeguarding the nations health security and strengthening its response to emerging public health threats.
Recognizing unsung heroes of public health
Reflecting on his previous appearance at the 2020 GAMLS Congress in Takoradi, Dr Akoriyea expressed deep admiration for laboratory professionals who, often away from the public eye, form the backbone of the nations diagnostic and surveillance systems.
When COVID-19 struck, and when outbreaks of yellow fever and other infectious diseases challenged our system, he said, you stood firm. You provided data that guided national decisions, results that enabled timely treatment, and surveillance that kept communities safe. Ghanas resilience was made visible through your expertise and dedication.
He reminded participants that resilience is not built in emergencies but cultivated every day, emphasizing the need for constant preparedness, innovation, and capacity-building in laboratory practice.
The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance
Turning attention to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), Dr Akoriyea cautioned that the threat grows quietly but dangerously, rendering common treatments ineffective and reversing decades of medical progress. He described the laboratorys role in the AMR fight as irreplaceable, highlighting that accurate diagnostics, resistance surveillance, and timely reporting form the backbone of effective antimicrobial stewardship.
To combat this silent epidemic, he called for full utilization of emerging technologies  genomics, artificial intelligence, and digital data systems  as well as cross-sectoral collaboration under the One Health approach, linking human, animal, and environmental health.
Strengthening the laboratory workforce
Dr Akoriyea reaffirmed the Ghana Health Services commitment to empowering laboratory professionals through policies and programs designed to enhance skills, motivation, and infrastructure.
We cannot strengthen disease surveillance without prioritizing the workforce driving it, he declared.
He outlined a comprehensive agenda that includes:
He further revealed that the GHS is working closely with the Ministry of Health (MoH) to finalize the scheme of service and implement improved working conditions for laboratory scientists, ensuring that Ghana retains and motivates its best professionals.
A call for partnership and shared responsibility
Dr Akoriyea stressed that the task of strengthening laboratory systems cannot rest on one institution alone. Resilience, he said, is a shared responsibility. He called on government agencies, professional bodies, academia, and industry partners to collaborate and invest collectively in laboratory infrastructure, research, and workforce development.
He commended the ongoing management and quality improvement initiatives supported by the Ghana Health Service, assuring participants that such projects would continue and be expanded across the countrys healthcare facilities.
Renewed commitment for the future
Closing his address, Dr Akoriyea paid tribute to the dedication and professionalism of Ghanas medical laboratory workforce, describing them as central to the nations vision of a safer and healthier future.
Your work saves lives every day. Though you may often operate away from the public eye, the nation sees you, respects you, and depends on you, he affirmed.
He encouraged participants to let professionalism and quality management principles guide their work, urging them to use the congress as a platform to forge stronger partnerships and explore innovative solutions for emerging health challenges.
Building a system that anticipates, not reacts
As the 2025 GAMLS Congress commenced, Dr Akoriyeas message resonated powerfully: Ghanas laboratory system must evolve from being reactive to being predictive and resilient. Through investment in people, technology, and collaboration, the nation can build a health system that is not shaken by threats but prepared for them.
Together, he concluded, let us build a laboratory system that leads with innovation, guided by science, and driven by service. May God bless our homeland Ghana and make our nation great and strong.

Health minister pledges stronger lab systems to safeguard sector,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has reaffirmed the governments commitment to strengthening Ghanas laboratory systems as a central pillar in the countrys health security agenda.
He made this declaration while addressing participants at the opening ceremony of the 2025 Annual National Congress of the Ghana Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists (GAMLS), held at the Sanctuary of Wind and Fire Assemblies of God Church in Tamale on Thursday, October 30, 2025.
Government to sponsor nurses and midwives for PhD training -
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
Delivering his speech under the theme, Enhancing Laboratory Resilience: Combating Emerging Infectious Diseases and AMR through Emerging Technologies, Collaboration, and Research, the Minister emphasized that no health system can be effective without a strong and resilient laboratory network.
Laboratories: The backbone of health systems
Akandoh noted that the COVID-19 pandemic reaffirmed a fundamental truth  laboratories are the backbone of effective healthcare systems. Laboratories are central to disease detection, patient management, and health security, he said, adding that effective laboratories are essential for swift outbreak containment and accurate diagnosis.
He cautioned that weak laboratory systems often lead to delayed diagnoses, mismanaged conditions, and uncontrolled infections. Laboratory resilience, he stated, is therefore a non-negotiable pillar of health sector reform and the resetting agenda.
Confronting emerging diseases antimicrobial resistance
Addressing the theme of the congress, the Minister outlined Ghanas dual challenge of emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, cholera, and meningitis continue to test the countrys readiness and resilience.
Citing World Health Organization (WHO) data, Akandoh revealed that AMR is now the third leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for over a million direct deaths annually. He warned that without urgent action, routine infections may become deadly, and standard treatments ineffective.
He reaffirmed Ghanas commitment to the global agenda of reducing deaths linked to bacterial AMR by 10% by 2030, referencing the 2019 baseline of 4.95 million deaths. Strong laboratory capacity for surveillance, diagnostics, and stewardship, he stressed, has therefore become very critical.
Harnessing technology for smarter laboratories
Akandoh announced that the Ministry of Health is collaborating with GAMLS, academia, and the private sector to integrate emerging technologies into the national health system. He highlighted innovations in genomics, digital health, point-of-care diagnostics, and artificial intelligence as game-changers in medical laboratory science.
Smarter laboratories, he said, will not only diagnose but also generate real-time data to inform policy, guide treatment, and predict emerging threats. Ghana, he emphasized, cannot be left out in the global agenda of eliminating public health threats using technology.
GRNMA apologises to Mintah Akandoh over Ridge Hospital incident
Partnerships and professionalism for a resilient system
The Minister underscored the need for coordinated laboratory networks linking public, private, academic, and research institutions. He said the Ministry and the Ghana Health Service are developing frameworks to standardize quality management and deploy resources efficiently.
He urged the Association to continue championing professionalism and enforcing standards: GAMLS must remain a community of scientists dedicated to national service and complement governments efforts in healthcare reform.
Research and innovation as pillars of resilience
Akandoh described research as another cornerstone of laboratory resilience. He called for stronger collaboration between scientists and policymakers to ensure that local research findings directly inform national health planning.
Evidence-based decision-making depends on local research capacity, he said. We must support young scientists and ensure findings are translated into policy and practice.
Investing in people and infrastructure
The Minister reiterated governments commitment to retooling health facilities and recruiting additional professionals, including medical laboratory scientists, under the 2026 budget. He also highlighted plans to establish a postgraduate specialist college for laboratory scientists, fulfilling a key manifesto promise.
Government is resetting the health sector to retain local resources for local solutions while meeting global health targets, he affirmed.
Tackling unemployment and quackery in the health sector
Addressing concerns about unemployment among healthcare professionals, Hon. Akandoh said the Ministry is taking pragmatic steps to regulate training and indexing. He has directed the Chief Director to constitute a steering committee to implement the governments promise of establishing a Medical Laboratory Science Council.
This move, he noted, will help ensure quality training and curb quackery within the profession. Additionally, plans are underway to expand public health laboratory coverage to enhance disease surveillance.
Towards sustainable health financing and universal health coverage
As part of the Resetting Agenda, the Minister outlined government efforts toward sustainable health financing to ensure transparency, quality, and patient safety. These efforts, he explained, are integral to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and making healthcare accessible to all Ghanaians.
A call to collective action
In his closing remarks, Akandoh reminded the gathering that resilience is built by choice, not chance. He called on all stakeholders  government, donors, academia, industry, and professionals  to collaborate in building laboratories capable of safeguarding the nations health.
The future of Ghanas health system depends on your work, he told the scientists. Together, we can build laboratories that are resilient, innovative, and capable of protecting every Ghanaian.
With that, the Minister formally declared the 2025 GAMLS Congress open, wishing all participants fruitful deliberations.

Experts warn of rising type 2 diabetes cases among Ghanaian children,"The Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Society of Ghana has expressed worry over the rising number of type 2 diabetes cases among children.
According to the President of the Society, Professor Josephine Akpalu, discussions about diabetes often focus on adults, leaving the increasing prevalence among children overlooked.
Enhancing access to diabetes care in Ghana: A call for collaborative action
She explained that in many cases, diagnosis in children is delayed until complications set in.
Many times in our society, for children with diabetes, the diagnosis is really made very late. Sometimes, it is only when they come to the hospital with a severe complication, which can even be fatal, that the diagnosis is made, she said in an interview on Channel One TV, monitored by GhanaWeb on Friday, November 7, 2025.
Elizabeth Esi Denyoh calls for urgent national action on diabetes
Professor Akpalu stressed the need for greater awareness about childhood diabetes, adding that many people still do not associate the condition with children.
We want to create that awareness of the problem existing in children. It is becoming more of a challenge now for our children because we dont expect them to have that, she noted.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes remains a major public health issue, especially in low and middle-income countries like Ghana, where Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are responsible for about 45% of all deaths, with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes being major contributors.
The WHO advises that maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activities, keeping a normal body weight, and avoiding tobacco use can help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
It further notes that the condition can be managed effectively and its complications prevented or delayed through proper diet, exercise, medication, and regular medical screening.

Julius Debrah reaffirms government's commitment to free primary healthcare,"The Presidential Envoy for Inter-Faith and Ecumenical Relations, Elvis Afriyie-Ankrah, over the weekend represented the Chief of Staff, Julius Debrah, at the opening of the 2025 Annual Conference of the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG), held at the Capital View Hotel in Koforidua.
Delivering the Chief of Staffs keynote address, Afriyie-Ankrah conveyed warm greetings from the President of the Republic, John Dramani Mahama and commended CHAG for its sustained contribution to national health delivery, especially in rural and underserved communities.
The conference was held under the theme: Sustaining Christian Identity, Ethics and Values in Health Systems Strengthening.
Julius Debrah noted that the theme was timely and appropriate, calling for renewed commitment to the values that have shaped Christian health services for over a century.
He stated that prior to the establishment of the Ministry of Health, Christian missions laid the foundation for healthcare in Ghana by establishing hospitals, clinics and training centres that delivered not just medicine, but compassionate service.
He stressed that health infrastructure and equipment alone cannot guarantee a strong system, adding that integrity, professionalism and respect for human dignity are essential.
A resilient health system is built on ethical leadership, trust, and compassion, he said.
These are not only Christian values but national values necessary for sustainable development.
The government, he noted, recognises CHAG as a strategic partner, accounting for nearly one-third of healthcare services nationwide.
This partnership between Church and State is one of Ghanas quiet success stories, he said, assuring that the Government would continue to collaborate with CHAG through policy dialogue, fair resource allocation and capacity building.
He reiterated the Governments commitment to implementing the Free Primary Health Care Programme, aimed at eliminating financial barriers to basic healthcare.
No mother should die in childbirth because she cannot afford medical care. No child should suffer from malaria because treatment is out of reach. No elderly person should be turned away due to lack of funds, he emphasised.
He called on CHAG to support the programme through expanded community outreach and continued commitment to non-discriminatory service.
Touching on the conference theme, Afriyie-Ankrah urged CHAG institutions to remain intentional in safeguarding their Christian identity in an evolving world, advocating for transparency, accountability and ethical leadership.
Your Christian identity is not merely a label; it is your light, he said, referencing Matthew 5:16.
He commended CHAG for its decades of service, sacrifice, and innovation and encouraged members to remain steadfast in upholding high ethical and professional standards.
Building an ethical and effective health system is a shared duty, he said. May God bless CHAG, our health workers and our nation, Ghana.

"Expert warns against monopoly in health data management, urges inclusive approach","A prominent IT and Cyber Security Expert, Samuel Kwame Adomako, has raised concerns about the government's approach to the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS) issue.
According to Adomako, the health minister's decision to award the contract for the new Ghana Health Information Management System (GHIMS) to a single vendor poses a significant risk to the country's health data.
The Controversy Surrounding LHIMS
The Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, recently accused the company behind LHIMS of underperformance and blackmail, citing the vendor's refusal to hand over administrative access and health data to the state.
The minister claimed that the vendor's actions led to widespread disruptions in the national health data system.
The sector minister, therefore, announced the introduction of a new GHIMS platform, designed to manage health information across the country and provide real-time access to patient records nationwide.
Adomako's Concerns
Adomako believes that the health minister's approach is misguided and may lead to a monopoly in the health data sector.
He expressed skepticism about the minister's assurance that the GHIMS would be state-managed, unlike the LHIMS which was handled by outsiders.
In his view, this change in management approach wouldn't necessarily address the underlying issues.
He argues that ""awarding the contract to a single vendor, weather outsider or insider could compromise the security and integrity of Ghana's health data.""
Adomako is calling for a more inclusive approach, recommending that Ghanaian IT companies and experts be involved in the process and receive a portion of the contract.
Ending Monopoly
According to Adomako, the health database should be open for every hospital to purchase its own database apps in order to end the monopoly.
This approach would promote competition, flexibility and innovation in the health data management sector.
Negative Impacts of Depending on One Vendor
Adomako highlighted some of the negative impacts that the country may face if it continues to depend on one vendor.
He said that depending on a single vendor could stifle competition and innovation in the health data management sector.
According to him, relying on one vendor increases vulnerability to system failures or disruptions, as there may be limited alternatives or support.
He also noted that a single vendor might limit the flexibility and scalability of the health information system, making it harder to adapt to changing needs.
As the government moves forward with the implementation of GHIMS, it remains to be seen whether the concerns raised by Adomako and other experts will be addressed.

AHPC Registrar calls for a national reset of Ghanas Allied Health agenda,"The Registrar of the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC) has called for a reset of Ghanas Allied Health agenda, urging professionals and regulators to work in harmony to strengthen the countrys healthcare delivery system.
The call was made during the 2025 Annual Induction and Oath-Swearing Ceremony of the AHPC, where 5,444 newly qualified Allied Health Graduates were formally inducted into the profession.
The event, held under the theme Resetting Ghanas Allied Health Agenda: The Strategic Role of the Regulator and the Professional, brought together policymakers, training institutions, regulatory bodies, and health sector stakeholders.
Delivering his keynote address on behalf the Minister of Health, Dr. Ignatius Awinibuno, Director of Allied Health, underscored the indispensable role Allied Health Professionals play in Ghanas healthcare system, noting that their work forms the foundation upon which other health professionals operate.
Often, when the story of healthcare is told, attention rests on doctors and nurses. Yet anyone who understands how a health system truly functions knows that without Allied Health Professionals, that story is incomplete, he stated.
He emphasized that the government is working closely with the AHPC and other stakeholders to ensure a more equitable distribution of health professionals across the country, especially in underserved communities.
For too long, the concentration of health professionals in urban centres has left rural and deprived communities underserved. We are determined to change that, Dr. Awinibuno said.
Dr. Ignatius Awinibuno also highlighted the Ministrys efforts to enhance digital health transformation, through the expansion of the national e-health framework and the integration of Allied Health data into Ghanas health information systems.
He commended the AHPC for maintaining professional standards and ethics, adding that regulation must be seen as a partnership rather than mere enforcement.
A well-regulated profession is the bedrock of public trust. The Council remains a strategic partner in shaping policy and ensuring that our training institutions produce competent practitioners ready for a 21st-century Ghana, he said.
In his address, Dr. Shirazu Issahaku, Registrar of the AHPC, welcomed the new inductees and celebrated the sectors progress, noting that the 2025 cohort marks a historic achievement for the Council.
Today, 5,444 newly qualified graduates from across the country will smoothly transition from studentship to healthcare service  a powerful testament to the vitality and growth of the allied health sector, he said.
Dr. Issahaku announced that the Council had, for the first time, successfully implemented Computer-Based Examination (CBE) for its national licensure examination, describing it as a major step towards modernization and transparency.
This innovation is not merely about technology; it is about fairness, efficiency, and credibility. It demonstrates our readiness to embrace a digital future where regulation and service delivery evolve hand in hand, he explained.
He charged the new professionals to serve with integrity, empathy, and commitment to continuous learning.
By taking the Allied Health Oath, you are pledging to uphold the highest standards of ethics, competence, and professionalism. The trust of the public is sacredonce earned, it must never be compromised, he emphasized.
Dr. Issahaku reaffirmed the Councils commitment to strengthening its regulatory systems and promoting professional development through collaboration with government and training institutions.
The Health ministry and the Registrar echoed a unified message: that resetting Ghanas Allied Health agenda requires collaboration between regulators, professionals, and policymakers to achieve universal health coverage and build a resilient, equitable, and technology-driven health sector.
The 2025 induction ceremony marks a new chapter in Ghanas health workforce development, with thousands of newly licensed professionals joining the nations effort to deliver quality healthcare to every Ghanaian.

KATH battles critical equipment shortage as only one CT scan functional,"The Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), the major referral facility serving the Ashanti Region and surrounding areas, is grappling with a critical shortage of essential medical equipment, severely affecting healthcare delivery.
Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday, November 4, 2025, the hospitals Chief Executive Officer, Dr Paa Kwesi Baidoo, disclosed that in its 70 years of existence, KATH has never owned a cardiac catheterisation machine, a crucial device used to diagnose and treat heart conditions.
Dr Baidoo further revealed that the hospital currently operates with only one functional CT scan machine out of three, putting immense pressure on staff and patients.
We have three scan machines; only one is working currently. Were trying to bring up the second one, and we have engineers working on that, he told the Committee.
The situation, he noted, continues to hamper the hospitals ability to provide efficient diagnostic and emergency care to the thousands of patients who depend on it daily.

German President honours Professor Frimpong-Boateng,"The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has honoured Ghanaian cardiothoracic surgeon Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng with the Federal Cross of Merit for his contribution to medical cooperation between Ghana and Germany.
The award, presented on Monday, November 3, 2025, at the residence of the German Ambassador in Accra, formed part of the German Presidents three-day state visit to Ghana.
German President to embark on three-day visit to Ghana
Professor Frimpong-Boateng was recognised for establishing lasting medical practice, education and research partnerships between the two countries.
President Steinmeier said Prof Frimpong-Boatengs continued partnership with German medical and research institutions has supported research and professional exchange in the field of cardiovascular medicine.
Prof Frimpong-Boateng trained as a cardiac surgeon at the Hannover Medical School in Germany, where he became one of the pioneers in heart transplantation in Germany.
He returned to Ghana in 1989 to establish the National Cardiothoracic Centre at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital.

The Centre, which also houses the Ghana Heart Foundation, which he also founded, has provided life-saving surgeries for patients and served as a training hub for medical professionals from Ghana and other African countries.
Professor Frimpong-Boateng has also facilitated research exchange programmes between Ghanaian and German medical institutions.
In a post-award interview, he said the recognition was a great honour but also a reminder of the need for Ghana to value its own professionals.
I am very grateful for this recognition from Germany, he said. It is, however, sad that sometimes it takes another country to value what we do for Ghana. I will continue to work for the good of our country through collaboration with our German friends.
Professor Frimpong-Boateng trained as a medical doctor at the University of Ghana. He pursued postgraduate studies in Germany, qualifying as a general, vascular, and cardiothoracic surgeon.
He returned to Ghana in 1989, established the National Cardiothoracic Centre in 1992, and later served as Chief Executive Officer of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital.
He became a professor at the University of Ghana Medical School and also served as Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation from 2017 to 2021.
The Federal Cross of Merit, also known as Verdienstkreuz am Bande, is one of Germanys highest honours. It is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the country or helped advance Germanys relations with other nations.
President Steinmeiers visit to Ghana is focused on strengthening bilateral ties, with engagements covering economic cooperation, education, and sustainable development.

Why the health ministry has begun equitable distribution of doctors nationwide,"The Ministry of Health has begun a nationwide exercise to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of doctors across Ghana.
The move, according to the ministry, forms part of a broader effort to strengthen healthcare delivery and ensure that every district hospital has access to qualified medical professionals.
Health Minister lays Ghana Medical Trust Fund Bill before Parliament
In a statement dated November 3, 2025, the ministry said it is urging newly recruited doctors currently undergoing the posting process to accept placements in available vacancies at regional and district hospitals.
""As part of efforts to equitably and fairly distribute doctors across the country, the Ministry of Health urges Doctors currently going through the recruitment process to accept postings to the available vacancies at the various regions and district hospitals.
""This exercise is part of the Ministrys broader commitment to improve evenly distribution of health professionals to ensure quality healthcare delivery nationwide,"" it noted.
The Ministry of Health warned doctors not to pay any person or group claiming to influence or speed up postings, stressing that no one has been authorised to collect money on their behalf.

"KATH, Ridge among 12 institutions referred to AG for failing to recover public funds","The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament has directed the Attorney General to prosecute 12 public institutions, including Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) and Ridge Hospital (Greater Accra Regional Hospital), for failing to recover funds flagged as financial losses in the Auditor-Generals report, according to myjoyonline.com news report on November 3, 2025.
According to the report, the decision follows the institutions disregard for a directive issued by the Committee, which required them to retrieve and account for the missing funds within 30 days.
Those who havent complied within the 30-day deadline will all be recommended to the Attorney General for prosecution. Its just that simple, Ranking Member of the Committee and Member of Parliament for Komenda Edina Eguafo Abrem, Samuel Atta-Mills said.
He further indicated that institutions granted longer recovery windows of 60 or 90 days would also face prosecution if they fail to act.
Maybe they would like to enjoy sitting in court, he remarked pointedly.
The Committees move marks a decisive shift in Parliaments approach to enforcing financial discipline in the public sector transitioning from issuing audit queries to initiating criminal proceedings against defiant officials.
The decision was triggered by a briefing from Michael Addo, Assistant Auditor-General at the Ghana Audit Service, who informed the Committee that one month after appearing before PAC, the affected institutions had still not fully retrieved funds lost through infractions such as unearned salaries and unauthorized payments.

Their failure to comply with the Committees post-hearing directive, an integral aspect of enforcing the Public Financial Management Act, necessitated referral to the Attorney Generals Department under constitutional provisions.
Although the PAC did not immediately disclose all 12 entities, sources indicate the list includes some of Ghanas leading public hospitals Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) and Ridge Hospital (Greater Accra Regional Hospital).
A full list of the affected Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) has been forwarded to the Attorney Generals office for further action.

Government has the right to audit health data systems  Dr Kwame Asiedu,"A Democracy and Development Fellow in Health at the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Dr Kwame Sarpong Asiedu, has stated that the government is fully within its rights to audit health data systems, describing such data as national security information.
His comments come amid the ongoing standoff between Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions Limited and the Ministry of Health, following allegations of overpayment and claims that the company had deliberately disrupted healthcare services to frustrate the government.
Lightwave, the firm behind Ghanas National E-Healthcare Programme and the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS), has denied the allegations, calling them misleading and unfounded.
Lightwave E-Healthcare dismisses health minister's claims over National E-Health project
The company insists that it has met all contractual obligations and that health facilities using the system continue to operate efficiently.
According to a report by myjoyonline.com on November 3, 2025, Lightwaves Senior Project Manager, Eric Agyei, disclosed that the company had not been informed of any official audit, despite reports that the Ministry had sent people to hospitals under the guise of Lightwave representatives.
Responding to the matter, Dr Asiedu clarified that while the state has every right to conduct an audit, such an exercise must follow due process and adhere to existing laws.
Health data is national security data because it contains disease and death rates, prevalence rates, medicines used, and other medical information. The state has every right to audit from the data controller, which is the hospitals, to the data processor. Theres no problem with the state doing an audit; that is allowed globally, he explained.
He emphasised that Lightwave, as a data processor, does not own the information it manages, and that the data ultimately belongs to the state.
The audit they cannot run away from because they are not the data owner. Nobody should delude themselves that the state doesnt have a right to investigate from the patient through the hospital to the data processor. The law allows the state to investigate end-to-end, he stated.
However, Dr Asiedu cautioned that if the companys claim of impersonation during the audit process is true, it raises serious ethical and legal concerns.

If there was impersonation, that is wrong, he said.
The Ministry of Health is yet to publicly respond to Lightwaves latest statement. The controversy has reignited broader discussions about data ownership, cybersecurity, and accountability in Ghanas digital health systems, as the country works to expand electronic healthcare delivery nationwide.

Lightwave E-Healthcare dismisses health minister's claims over National E-Health project,"Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions Limited has rejected allegations by the Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, concerning the management of Ghanas National E-Healthcare Programme and the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS).
In a detailed statement issued on October 31, 2025, the company described the ministers remarksmade in Parliament on October 28 and repeated during the Presidencys Accountability Series on October 29, as false, misleading and damaging to Ghanas digital health transformation.
Lightwave, which developed and implemented the LHIMS platform, stressed that it is a wholly Ghanaian-owned company, established in 2015 and employing more than 150 local staff.
It added that its sister company, Lightwave E-Healthcare Services LLC, based in Atlanta, Georgia, is also owned by the same Ghanaian shareholder.
Addressing claims that Ghanaian medical data was being hosted or managed from India, the company clarified that all patient data is securely stored within Ghana under the full control of the Ministry of Health.
The healthcare data of Ghanaians remains the property of the Ministry of Health. It is neither managed nor stored in India or any foreign location, the statement affirmed.
While acknowledging that the LHIMS software remains its intellectual property, Lightwave explained that the Ministry was granted a licence to use the platform for the duration of the contract, consistent with international software licensing practices.
The company outlined its track record on the National E-Healthcare Project, stating that it successfully completed Phase One in 2017, deploying LHIMS in 23 health facilities across the Central Region, including the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital.
Lightwave Contract Saga: Okoe Boye challenges Mintah Akandoh over fine details
Phase Two of the project, valued at US$100 million, was approved in 2019 to expand deployment to 950 facilities nationwide.
In response to claims that only half of the project had been executed despite 77 percent of the contract value being paid, Lightwave said such assertions were misleading.
According to the company, the projects financial structure assigned higher cost weights to teaching and regional hospitals, meaning progress should be measured by contract value rather than the number of facilities.
As of December 31, 2024, Lightwave had fully deployed the system in all four teaching hospitals, six regional hospitals and 243 district hospitals, representing about 72 percent of the contract value, the statement noted.
Lightwave attributed project delays largely to late payments from the Ministry, with some invoices outstanding for over 10 months, as well as disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company also disclosed that it had not received payment for eight months of post-contract work, despite repeated assurances from the Ministry.
In addition, it claimed to have completed extra work worth approximately US$25 million, such as system integrations with the National Health Insurance Authority, commercial banks, pharmacies and the Births and Deaths Registry, none of which has been compensated.
According to the company, currently, the LHIMS platform remains operational in more than 200 health facilities across the country, including the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Eastern Regional Hospital, Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital and Walewale District Hospital.
Lightwave expressed disappointment over the current standoff but reiterated its readiness to work with the Ministry to complete pending installations and sustain the systems reliability.
The LHIMS platform has served Ghana effectively for nearly nine years. It remains one of the continents most robust e-health systems. We hope this clarification ends speculation and allows for a constructive resolution.""

Ghana will succeed in fighting poor sanitation - Ahmed Ibrahim,"Ghana is on track to overcome the long-standing challenge of poor sanitation through collective national effort and renewed commitment at all levels, Ahmed Ibrahim, Minister for Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, has said.
He said the overwhelming public participation, strong media support, and active involvement of traditional authorities and religious leaders in the national sanitation day programmes were clear indicators of progress.
The Minister was speaking at the November edition of the National Sanitation Day, which involved monitoring of the exercise in the La Dade-Kotopon Municipality, the Ledzokuku Municipality, and the Krowor Municipality.
Some of the areas in the Municipalities monitored included Tsui bleoo last stop down to Mobil, and the Nungua Secondary School to Addongonno Street and Railway line.
Ibrahim said the enthusiasm from participants was remarkable, resulting in approximately 98 per cent compliance.
However, the main challenge faced was logistical support.
He said the Ministry was still in the process of procuring essential sanitation equipment, including dustbins, containers, compactors, wheelbarrows, wellington boots, and shovels.
""I am confident that with increased momentum in the procurement of these logistics, the upcoming December cleanup exercise will be even more successful,"" he added.
The Minister said President John Dramani Mahama was expected to launch new sanitation equipment soon, and that they would ensure timely provision of the required resources to complement that effort.
He said in collaboration with the Municipal, Metropolitan and District Chief Executives, and the relevant sector ministries, plans were underway to install additional streetlights to improve visibility and safety during such exercises.
""Regarding the Environmental Service Providers Association (ESPA), I intentionally refrained from public commentary after their recent statement announcing an ultimatum to government by November 7""
""Instead, I opted for dialogue. As a Ministry, we have engaged ESPA in constructive discussions to address their concerns, and I have assured them that I will meet with other stakeholders to find sustainable solutions,"" he added.
Oboade Nortse King Professor Nii Odaifio Welentsi III, the Nungua Mantse, reaffirmed his commitment to supporting the President's directive for the exercise, emphasising the importance of collective participation to sustain progress in the fight against poor sanitation.
He urged the Member of Parliament and Municipal Chief Executive of La Dade-Kotopon Municipal Assembly to engage the management of La Palm Royal Beach, Pleasure Beach, and Laboma Beach, for a meeting with him at the Regional House of Chiefs to highlight to them that sanitation was a collective responsibility and not solely the duty of the government.
""The management of these establishments are to contribute to the proper reconstruction of the gutters along the main road leading to their facilities, as this will improve environmental hygiene and enhance the appeal of their businesses,"" he added.
Nii Welentsi III, who doubles as the President of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs, called on the public to cultivate a culture of cleanliness without waiting for directives.
He also reminded community leaders of their responsibilities, stressing that leadership was not only about meetings and appearances, but about service and accountability to the people.
He cautioned against the illegal sale of lands, warning that unregulated practices could lead to future complications.
""If we continue to sell lands irresponsibly, we may one day find ourselves buying lands from strangers or having none left to buy,"" he said.
He disclosed that the Regional House of Chiefs would soon introduce a policy to regulate land sales, noting that anyone found selling more than an acre without authorization would face sanctions.

UNFPA warns of contraceptive shortages as crisis looms for women's health,"The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a stark warning about the global erosion of access to contraceptives as the world prepares for the seventh International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP 2025) in Bogota, Colombia, from November 16, 2025.
In a statement, UNFPA Executive Director Diene Keita emphasized that contraceptives save lives, underscoring nearly 50 years of recognition by global health authorities as essential medicine. Yet, funding shortfalls are now threatening stocks in communities worldwide, including Ghana, where reliance on international aid could unravel hard-won gains in reproductive health.
Keitas remarks come at a critical juncture, just days before ICFP 2025; the worlds premier gathering of advocates, researchers, policymakers, and youth leaders focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Hosted for the first time in Latin America, the conference theme, Equity Through Action, calls for urgent collaboration to safeguard family planning amid rising challenges.
For Ghana, a nation that has made strides in family planning but faces acute vulnerabilities, the statement resonates deeply, highlighting the need for sustainable domestic investment to protect women and girls from unintended pregnancies, maternal deaths, and economic setbacks.
How Ken Ofori-Atta allegedly defied Bawumia's directive to analyse GRA-SML deal - Senyo Hosi
The Global Imperative: Contraceptives as Lifelines
People want [contraceptives], use them, and rely on them every day, Keita affirmed, pointing to overwhelming evidence of their transformative power.
When women and adolescent girls have access, pregnancies are more likely to be planned and safe, enabling them to complete education, secure employment, and realize their potential.
Healthier children and more prosperous societies follow, with contraceptives proven to reduce abortion rates and complications from pregnancy and childbirth.
The economic case is equally compelling: Every $1 invested in addressing unmet contraceptive needs generates nearly $27 in benefits, from averted healthcare costs to boosted productivity.  U
NFPA and partners have spent decades fortifying supply chains to deliver quality, affordable options, even to remote areas, saving millions of lives. But global funding gaps, exacerbated by geopolitical shifts and aid cuts, are causing stocks to dwindle. Health systems brace for surges in unintended pregnancies, linked to higher maternal mortality (including from unsafe abortions), adolescent pregnancies, school dropouts, and gender-based violence.
Keitas call to action is clear: Lets work together to keep our promise to women and adolescent girls, uphold their rights and choices, and ensure they have access to the contraceptives they need to plan and forge a healthy and prosperous future.
As ICFP 2025 convenes, this message will fuel discussions on innovative financing, equitable access, and resilient health systems.
Ghanas Story: Progress Under Threat
In Ghana, UNFPAs alert, echoes local realities, where family planning has been a cornerstone of maternal health improvements. The countrys modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) among women aged 1549 stands at about 27%, up from previous years, reflecting government efforts like the Costed Implementation Plan and integration into the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).
Yet, three in 10 women still face unmet needs, with regional disparities stark, particularly in the North, where indicators lag due to cultural barriers, limited facilities, and low awareness.
Funding disruptions amplify these risks. Historically, USAID covered 45% of Ghanas contraceptive procurement, but a recent stop-work order has created a massive gap.
UNFPA now supplies 40%, the West African Health Organization (WAHO) 5%, and the government just 10%, leaving supplies vulnerable.  Without swift action, Ghana risks reversals in its FP2030 commitments and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 3 on health and well-being.
The human toll is evident in the numbers: Unintended pregnancies account for 37% of all pregnancies, with 23% mistimed and 14% unwanted.  Over half (58%) of births to girls aged 15-19 and one-third to those aged 20-24 are unintended, fueling unsafe abortions that contribute 12-30% of maternal deaths; the third leading cause after hemorrhage.
Ghanas maternal mortality ratio remains high at 310 per 100,000 live births, with adolescents facing even greater risks  1.8 times higher without modern methods.
Pathways Forward: Lessons from Ghana for ICFP 2025
Ghanas response offers hope and a blueprint. The Ghana Health Service (GHS) Director-General, Dr. Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, recently urged ramping up domestic financing during National Family Planning Week, emphasizing integration into universal health coverage.
UNFPA Ghana advocates for a dedicated budget linealready approved for essential commoditiesand comprehensive sexuality education in schools to empower youth.    Partnerships with organizations like Marie Stopes International and the Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana have expanded access, but more is needed to bridge the 35% unmet need among married women and 20% among unmarried ones.
At ICFP 2025, Ghanaian delegates are expected to amplify these voices, sharing successes in supply chain strengthening and calls for global solidarity.

Presidency holds Breast Cancer Awareness commemoration at Jubilee House,"The Office of the President, on Friday, October 31, 2025, held a commemorative event at the Jubilee House in observance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, under the theme: Catch it Early, Treat it Right, and Survive it.
The event brought together policymakers, health professionals, Presidential staffers, officers at the Office of the President, advocates, and survivors to reaffirm Ghanas national commitment to early detection, equitable treatment, and continuous public education on breast cancer.
Delivering the keynote address,
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo
, Deputy Chief of Staff (Admin), emphasised that the fight against breast cancer must move beyond awareness to action and access.
She described breast cancer as a national health priority and a social equity issue, urging collaboration across government and civil society to make screening and treatment accessible to all.
We must resist the temptation of making this theme another slogan because we are losing many friends, loved ones, and colleagues to breast cancer, she said.
Nana Oye also highlighted the governments continued commitment to building a healthier population under the leadership of President Mahama and Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, citing key initiatives such as the Mahama Trust Fund for chronic disease treatment, including breast cancer.
She also commended Her Excellency Lordina Mahamas nationwide health screening outreaches in partnership with the Ghana AIDS Commission, reaffirming that these efforts demonstrate Ghanas dedication to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases such as breast cancer by 2030.
She commended Ghanaian women and men who continue to lead advocacy and community outreach, adding that empowering people with knowledge is the first step toward reducing breast cancer mortality nationwide.
Professor Dr Grace Ayensu-Danquah, Deputy Minister of Health, delivered the opening remarks, highlighting the governments ongoing commitment to strengthening early detection systems and improving cancer care services across the country.
She reiterated that public education, preventive screening, and destigmatisation are critical pillars in building a healthier Ghana.
Our goal is to make early detection routine, not rare, Dr Ayensu-Danquah noted. Under the esteemed leadership of His Excellency,
John Dramani Mahama
, we remain committed to equipping our systems to fight breast cancer.
The program also featured insights from medical professionals Dr John Yaw Antwi and Dr Cynthia Amissah, who digitally demonstrated proper breast self-examination techniques, discussed preventive strategies and treatment options, and encouraged the normalisation of self-examination and regular check-ups.
They cautioned that myths and fear often delay treatment and urged open conversations about breast health across communities.
Equally moving were the survivor stories, moderated by Lily Mohammed, Senior Broadcaster at EIB Network. The testimonies echoed a unifying message: early detection and timely care save lives. One survivor recounted how a routine check-up led to her survival, while another described finding purpose and strength after recovery. Both called on others to check early and never lose hope.
I am alive today because I checked early, one survivor shared. No one should wait until its too late to know.
The commemoration concluded with a strong collective message: breast cancer awareness must extend beyond October, becoming a sustained national movement for prevention, compassion, and healing.
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo
and Dr Ayensu-Danquah reaffirmed the governments dedication to promoting preventive healthcare, strengthening cancer treatment infrastructure, and ensuring that early detection remains a national health priority.
Let this not end as an October conversation, another survivor urged. Let us carry this message into every home, every school, and every workplace, because saving lives begins with speaking up, checking early, and treating right.
Through this initiative, the Presidency reaffirmed its commitment to promoting health awareness, empowering individuals, and fostering a culture of preventive healthcare across the nation.",,Health,  2 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Presidency-holds-Breast-Cancer-Awareness-commemoration-at-Jubilee-House-2007719
FDA warns public not to patronise Omama Herbal Mixture,"The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has urged the public not to patronise an anti-malaria medicine known as Omama Herbal Mixture.
In a statement issued Friday, October 31, 2025, the FDA said the herbal medicine contained some chemicals, which could be dangerous when used without a prescription.
The FDA concluded a laboratory analysis and market surveillance conducted in collaboration with the Ghana Police Service, the statement said.
The laboratory analysis revealed that Omama Herbal Mixture has been adulterated with Diazepam, Metronidazole, Paracetamol and Niacinamide, which are allopathic medicines, it said.
It is important to note that Omama Herbal Mixture is registered as a herbal medicinal product indicated for Malaria and Loss of appetite and is not expected to contain any allopathic medicines.
The medicines found in Omama Herbal Mixture are dangerous when taken without prescription and/or advice from a qualified health professional.
The Authority added that it would work with Omama Herbal Group Limited to recall all products on the market for safe disposal and appropriate regulatory actions, including criminal prosecution initiated.
The FDA wishes to assure the public that it will not relent on its efforts to ensure public health and safety.
The public is advised to give information on persons, pharmacies, and over-the-counter medicine sellers (OTCMS) offering Omama Herbal Mixture for sale to the nearest FDA Offices.
As part of its market surveillance early in October this year, the FDA also suspended the operations of nine sachet water producers in the Western North Region over expired registration license.
The sachet water producers were within the Wiawso Municipality and the Bia West and East districts.
Albert Ankamah, the Western North Regional Director of the FDA, said the exercise was to ensure that water producers, food and drug manufacturers complied with good manufacturing, hygienic and storage practices to ensure the safety of consumers.",,Health,  1 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/FDA-warns-public-not-to-patronise-Omama-Herbal-Mixture-2007657
'Breast cancer is curable if detected early' - Deputy Chief of Staff calls for action,"As part of activities commemorating Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Presidency organised a Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Programme for its staff.
A statement issued by the Presidency said the event, which took place at the Banquet Hall on Friday, October 31, was on the theme: Catch it Early, Treat it Right and Survive it.
It involved a series of activities, including experience sharing, health talk, panel discussion, open forum and breast cancer screening (at the Clinic).
Nana Nana Oye Bampoe Addo, the Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of Finance and Administration, encouraged periodic screening and stated that breast cancer was treatable and curable when detected early.
She also reiterated the governments commitment to investing more in health infrastructure, training, access to quality care and medicine.
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo noted that it was all a collective duty to support efforts at achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims at reducing maternal mortality and non-communicable diseases such as breast cancer by 2030.
As we commemorate Breast Cancer Awareness Month at the Office of the President, let us remember that early detection is not just a medical act, she said.
It is an act of love, an act of courage, and an act of survival. Lets catch it early and give life a fighting chance. When we treat it right, we restore hope. And when we survive it, we inspire countless others to do the same.
The Deputy Chief of Staff added, No woman, no family, no one should walk this path alone. Lets fight breast cancer together. Lets fight not only for a cure but for the dignity and hope and healing for us all.
She noted that the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares) covered specialist-level treatments for chronic diseases, including breast cancer, and complemented the already existing coverage of the National Health Insurance Scheme.
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo also noted that testimonies by survivors and the increase in public education were making an impact and must be sustained.
To you as survivors, we stand with you in courage and compassion. Lets all replace stigma with support and silence with solidarity, she said.
Professor Grace Ayensu-Danquah, the Deputy Minister of Health, who is also a distinguished surgeon, used the occasion to counsel participants, particularly the female staff, to undergo regular screening.
Together we can build a future where no one faces breast cancer alone, where survival is not a privilege but a promise.
The month of October each year is observed worldwide as Breast Cancer Awareness month to create awareness, promote early detection and treatment of the disease.
According to the World Health Organisation, in 2022, there were an estimated 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 670,000 deaths globally.",,Health,  1 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Breast-cancer-is-curable-if-detected-early-Deputy-Chief-of-Staff-calls-for-action-2007648
Ban all forms of mining  Health administrators urge President Mahama,"The Association of Health Administrators of Ghana (AHSAG) has called on President John Dramani Mahama to, as a matter of urgency, impose an immediate, temporary ban on all forms of mining activities across the country.
The Associations demand stemmed from the undeniable, severe risks unregulated mining activities pose to public health, environmental sustainability and the very fabric of mining communities.
Reverend Ezekiel Amadu Daribi, President of AHSAG, said mining, particularly small-scale operations, had inflicted widespread contamination of otherwise crystal clear water bodies, devastated aquatic ecosystems and poisoned drinking water sources.
The health implications of these, he said, were unqualifiedly alarming, ranging from respiratory illnesses and skin diseases to long-term chronic conditions due to exposure to toxic chemicals commonly used in these mining processes.
The adverse effect of this on our health, our water bodies, and the peoples systemic livelihood is enormous and irreversible.
The continued allowance of mining activities threatens to overturn decades of public health progress and compromises the future well-being of Ghanaian citizens.
Only a firm, decisive ban can halt the alarming degradation currently unfolding in the country, to enable the government to craft and enforce rigorous regulatory frameworks to safeguard health and the environment, Rev Daribi said at the 48th Annual Conference and Continuing Professional Education Programme of AHSAG in Cape Coast.
The conference was on the theme: Optimising Internal Resources Mobilisation for Infrastructure and Equipment Management; The Position of the Health Service Administrator.
The forum of Ghana Health Service (GHS) Administrators provided the platform for professional engagement and knowledge sharing, on resource mobilisation and prudent management of infrastructure and equipment at various health facilities.
Dr Kwasi Addai-Donkoh, Chairman National Council of AHSAG, lamented the dwindling external funding and uncertainty, and the imperative to harness and optimise internal resources by health administrators.
He said infrastructure and equipment formed the backbone of any functional health system, but without strategic management, they become liabilities rather than assets.
However, he urged health administrators to be innovative to leverage internal resources to address the shortfalls in the management of health infrastructure and equipment as a critical area of investment that required unfathomable thinking and action.
This is where Health Service Administrators stand tall. As custodians of operational efficiency, Health Service Administrators are inimitably positioned to lead the charge in resource mobilisation.
Whether through innovative budgeting, strategic partnerships, improved revenue generation and retention, or data-driven asset management, our role is no longer peripheral is central.
We must reimagine our facilities not just as service delivery points, but as dynamic ecosystems capable of generating, managing, and reinvesting resources. This calls for a shift in mindset from gatekeeping to stewardship, from routine management to visionary leadership, he explained.
The Central Regional Director of Ghana Health Administrators urged health administrators to always scrutinise contracts, particularly Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), some of whom she described as fleecing the country.
She stressed the need for them to avoid the misuse of utilities and remain professional in the discharge of their duties at all times.
Dr Kwasi Addai-Donkoh, Chairman of the National Council of AHSAG, expressed concern over declining external funding for health and its uncertainty, emphasising the urgent need for health administrators to effectively harness and optimise internal resources.
He said infrastructure and equipment were vital to any functioning health system, but without strategic health management, they risk becoming liabilities instead of assets.
In that light, Dr Addai-Donkoh called on health administrators to adopt innovative approaches to utilise internal resources, addressing gaps in managing health infrastructure and equipment, demanding bold thinking and decisive action.
Health Service Administrators hold a crucial role. As guardians of operational efficiency, they are uniquely positioned to lead in resource mobilisation.
Whether through creative budgeting, strategic partnerships, enhanced revenue generation and retention, or data-driven asset management, our role has evolved from peripheral to central, he stated.
Dr Alberta Adjeibey Biritwum-Nyarko, the Central Regional Director of the GHS, urged health administrators to carefully review health contracts, particularly PPPs and MoUs, warning that some arrangements exploited the country.
She stressed the importance of avoiding waste in utilities, putting idle resources to prudent revenue ventures by instilling discipline and professionalism at all times.
Ekow Panyin Okyere Eduamoah,  Central Regional Minister, in a brief remark, commended the group for holding forth for nearly five decades of service to Ghana.
He reiterated the governments commitment to mobilise resources to complete health infrastructure, institutions, and pay NHIS claims, among others, to improve the well-being of the citizenry.",,Health,  1 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ban-all-forms-of-mining-Health-administrators-urge-President-Mahama-2007641
Speaker Bagbin leads breast cancer awareness drive,"As part of Ghanas observance of October as the Pink Month, dedicated to breast cancer awareness, Speaker of Parliament,
Alban Bagbin
, has made a striking financial contribution towards the fight against breast cancer.
Speaking on the floor of Parliament on Friday, October 31, 2025, Bagbin announced that each Member of Parliament would have GH1,000 deducted from their November salary, with his own top-up of GH24,000, culminating in a GH300,000 donation to the Breast Society of Ghana.
Bagbins remarks extended beyond financial support and urged wives to actively involve their husbands in breast health, encouraging them to teach their partners how to perform breast screenings.
In a controversial yet candid moment, Bagbin also advised women not to imprison their breasts in brassieres, suggesting that openness and regular checks were vital in the fight against breast cancer.
His comments, though unconventional, were aimed at breaking cultural taboos and promoting early cancer detection.
By framing breast health as a shared responsibility within families, Mr Bagbin emphasised the importance of awareness, education, and proactive care.
The Speakers initiative adds momentum to Pink Month activities nationwide, reinforcing the message that breast cancer is not just a womens issueit is a societal one.
Dr Mahama Tia Kabiru, Member of Parliament for Walewale, while contributing to the discussion, described the breast as an endangered organ due to the rising threat of cancer.
He emphasised that while women were the biological hosts of the breast, its benefits extended to babies and husbands, making its care a shared responsibility.
In a passionate appeal, the legislator urged husbands to actively support their wives by ensuring they undergo breast screening every six months.
The legislator noted that this was not just a health imperative, but as a gesture of love and partnership.
According to Dr Kabiru, early detection through regular screening was key to combating breast cancer and preserving lives.
He also cautioned against what he termed the imprisoning of the breastlikely referring to restrictive cultural attitudes or neglect that prevent open discussion and proactive care.
His comments suggest a need for greater awareness and destigmatization of breast health issues, especially in communities where such topics may be considered taboo.",,Health,  1 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Speaker-Bagbin-leads-breast-cancer-awareness-drive-2007640
"'Dadesen' pots linked to cancer, kidney diseases - FDA","The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has warned the public over the widespread use of locally-made cooking pots, popularly known as Dadesen, after detecting dangerously high levels of lead in them.
According to a report by 3news.com, the Eastern Regional Manager of the FDA, Anita Owusu-Kuffour, made this known during a stakeholder engagement at Somanya.
She revealed that FDA surveillance uncovered a troubling practice among some local manufacturers who deliberately add lead during production.
When they are making the pots, the metal becomes hard, so they add lead to soften it. The sad part is that most local manufacturers have no idea about the health implications.
We are advising the public to stop using Dadesen that contains lead, he noted.
FDA urges vigilance, warns of arrests for unsafe food sales
Anita Owusu-Kuffour further cautioned against the use of worn-out nonstick cookware, explaining that once the protective coating erodes, it can release harmful heavy metals and toxic chemicals into food.
If the coating wears off, you are exposing yourself to serious health risks, including cancer, because some of these coatings contain heavy metals.
Chronic Kidney Disease in Ghana: Treatment challenges and prevention tips
As science and technology improve, it is important for all of us to move away from harmful practices and embrace safer alternatives, she emphasised.
The FDA said lead, a highly toxic heavy metal, makes the metal easier to mould but exposes users to severe health conditions such as cancer, kidney failure, and Parkinsons disease.

Ghana convenes stakeholders to advance WASH Sector Action Plan for NDC revision,"The Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs (MLGCRA), in collaboration with the Ministry of Works, Housing and Water Resources (MWHWR), has convened an expert consultation workshop to support the development of a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Sector Action Plan as part of Ghanas ongoing revision of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
To facilitate multi-stakeholder engagement in the development of a comprehensive WASH Sector Action Plan, the workshop brought together stakeholders from government institutions, development partners, academia, civil society, the private sector, and youth networks.
This inclusive process underscores Ghanas commitment to integrating climate action across all sectors while ensuring alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and national development priorities.
Stakeholders represented included the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the Ghana Rice Inter-professional Body, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research  Savanna Agricultural Research Institute (CSIR-SARI).
Development partners such as UNICEF Ghana, UNDP Ghana, WaterAid Ghana, and World Vision Ghana also participated, alongside professional associations, private sector actors, and youth climate organisations.
The WASH Sector Action Plan serves as a strategic blueprint for integrating climate change considerations into both national and sub-national WASH programming.
It outlines clear sectoral priorities, highlights opportunities for impactful climate action, and identifies existing barriers within water, sanitation, hygiene, and solid waste management. By developing a strong climate rationale, the plan aims to inform Ghanas NDC revision process.
Ultimately, it seeks to align the sectors commitments with the countrys broader vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon development pathway.
Through technical presentations, thematic discussions, and consensus-building plenary sessions, participants worked collaboratively to shape sectoral recommendations and priority actions.
The outputs of the workshop will contribute directly to Ghanas NDCs 3.0, extending the countrys targets to 2035 in line with international frameworks, while simultaneously enhancing the ambition of commitments and unlocking finance at scale.
As part of its broader mandate to support inclusive and ambitious climate action, UNDP Ghana provided technical and logistical support to the consultation process, helping to ensure broad participation and meaningful dialogue across sectors.
Mohammed Gyimah, Deputy Director at the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, highlighted the importance of the meeting:
Strengthening Ghanas climate response requires cross-sector collaboration and evidence-based planning. This workshop has provided us with an opportunity to define sectoral priorities and identify practical pathways for integrating climate action into WASH. The outcomes will not only inform the revision of our NDCs but also guide long-term strategies for resilience and sustainable development.
This initiative demonstrates the strong collaboration between the Government of Ghana and its development partners, with UNDP reaffirming its commitment to advancing climate-resilient development and supporting Ghana in delivering on its NDC commitments.", Information Ghana,Health, 31 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ghana-convenes-stakeholders-to-advance-WASH-Sector-Action-Plan-for-NDC-revision-2007537
Okoe Boye urges Chief of Staff to mediate Lightwave contract dispute,"A former Minister of Health, Dr
Bernard Okoe Boye
, has appealed to the Chief of Staff,
Julius Debrah
, to intervene in the dispute over the termination of a contract between the Ministry of Health and Lightwave Health Information Management System.
In a report by 3news.com on October 29, 2025, Dr Okoe Boye cautioned that failure by the Chief of Staff to step in could result in financial loss to the state.
I would recommend that the Chief of Staff engages the services of a professional mediation company. I know of Gamey and Gamey. I did some courses with them. Let Gamey and Gamey come in. They can take up the case from both the Ministry of Health and the vendors angle and help resolve this amicably, he said.
Health minister outlines 4-week plan to restore Ghana's electronic healthcare system
His comments followed a statement made earlier by the current Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, during the Government Accountability Series, where he disclosed that investigations by the ministry had revealed significant anomalies in the execution of the contract with Lightwave Health Information Management System.
Dr Okoe Boye criticised his successor for failing to handle the termination process in an orderly manner, warning that the approach being taken could lead to the repetition of already completed work and unnecessary expenditure.
This minister, what he has failed to do is to find a way to orderly terminate the contract. One grave consequence is that when the minister was asked, you have now gone in for someone, and guess what, this new person is not going to complete the rest of the five hundred. He is going to redo the 450 that Lightwave has done. Can you imagine? This is a serious financial loss, he stated.
He expressed concern that the ministrys actions could result in wasteful spending, as the government risks paying a new vendor to repeat work already completed by Lightwave.

What makes me worried for this country is that we have a minister who is ready to pay a new vendor to start again, work that has already been done, but is unwilling to say that let me give you this money so that you complete this work, so that I can now have access to everything you have. This minister is about to put the government in a serious financial loss situation, he indicated.
Dr
Bernard Okoe Boye
further urged the media to scrutinise the issue closely, warning against repeating past mistakes.

"Dr Okoe Boye defends Lightwave, calls for fair resolution of e-health dispute","Former Minister of Health, Dr Bernard Okoe Boye, has dismissed recent claims made against Lightwave e-Healthcare Solutions, the company that implemented Ghanas National e-Health Project, describing the ongoing controversy as an attempt to give a dog a bad name to hang it.
In a statement titled The LHIMS Controversy: A Case of Giving the Dog a Bad Name to Hang It, Dr Okoe Boye outlined the background of the project and challenged what he described as misinformation surrounding its implementation and management.
He explained that the National e-Health Project began in 2016 to digitize and network all government health facilities. The initiative, which started with 25 facilities in the Central Region, was expanded after a successful pilot.
Following approvals from the Public Procurement Authority and the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health signed a US$100 million contract in March 2019 with Lightwave e-Healthcare Solutions for a nationwide rollout he revealed.
According to Dr Okoe Boye, Lightwave has so far digitized more than 450 health facilities, including four teaching hospitals, six regional hospitals, and over 240 district hospitals. More than 150,000 health workers have been trained under the project.
He noted that implementation delays were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain challenges, and difficulties in compliance by some facilities. Payments so far total US$76.99 million, with about US$23 million outstanding.
The former minister disputed several claims made by the current Minister of Health, including suggestions that Lightwave is a foreign company and that Ghanas health data is stored outside the country.
Lightwave is a wholly Ghanaian-owned company, and all patient data is stored locally in servers managed by the Ministry of Health, he stated.
Dr Okoe Boye questioned the governments decision to engage a new company, the Ghana Health Information Management System (GHIMS), to replace Lightwave.
He argued that GHIMS is not a state-owned entity and has digitized fewer than five facilities, compared to the extensive work already completed by Lightwave.
He warned that replacing Lightwave could lead to data loss, financial waste, and disruption of health services for millions of Ghanaians.
The logical approach would be to allow any new vendor to continue from where Lightwave left off, not to redo completed work, he advised.

GHS cautions public as seasonal flu cases rise across Ghana,"The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has cautioned the public about a rise in seasonal influenza (flu) cases across parts of the country.
In a statement, the Service said the country is currently experiencing increased infections caused by Influenza A strains H3N2 and H1N1viruses that commonly circulate during Ghanas cooler months.
The highest number of cases has been recorded in the Greater Accra, Central, Bono and Eastern Regions.
According to 3news.com report on October 29, 2025, GHS explained that symptoms of the flu appear suddenly and may include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache and fatigue.
GHS confirms influenza outbreak in four regions
The disease spreads mainly through droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking, and by touching contaminated surfaces.
According to the Service, children and adolescents in school, the elderly, pregnant women and people with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are at higher risk of contracting the infection or developing complications.
High-risk environments include schools, dormitories, markets and transport hubs.
To help curb transmission, the GHS urged the public to seek medical attention early when flu-like symptoms appear, stay home when unwell, practice regular handwashing with soap and water, cover coughs and sneezes, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, avoid crowded places and wear face masks when necessary.
On the institutional level, health facilities have been directed to enhance surveillance and diagnostic testing, update case management protocols, and intensify public education through community and media channels.
H3N2 Outbreak: 42 cases confirmed in Greater Accra Region  Report
The Service is also coordinating with regional health directorates to ensure a timely and effective response.

Health minister outlines 4-week plan to restore Ghana's electronic healthcare system,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has announced a four-week roadmap to resolve the ongoing breakdown in Ghanas electronic healthcare management system.
Addressing journalists at the Government Accountability Series on Wednesday, October 29, 2025, he said the government has procured a new platform, the Ghana Healthcare Information Management System (GHIMS), to tackle the disruptions and ensure continuity of healthcare delivery nationwide.
Akandoh explains why Agenda 111 projects, nurses' arrears were not in 2025 Budget
He explained that health facilities across the country will be gradually migrated onto the new system within four weeks.
The plan, going forward, is that in the next one week, we are going to begin with the teaching hospitals, the regional hospitals, and the highly populated district hospitals, to roll them over onto the system. In the second week, well move to the remaining district hospitals, and in the third week, well focus on the clinics, health centers, and CHPS compounds.
I am confidently announcing to the good people of this country that we have a four-week plan that will get us out of this mess, Mintah Akandoh said.
He reaffirmed the governments commitment to strengthening Ghanas digital health infrastructure.

The medical records of Ghanaians would never go back to the manual way. We are moving forward, responsibly, confidently, and decisively, he added.
The breakdown of the old system caused significant delays in patient registrations, record-keeping, and claims processing, especially in the Ashanti Region, where several hospitals reverted to manual operations.
Patients have since complained about prolonged waiting times and slower service delivery.

LHIMS system disruption caused by vendor 'sabotage' - Health minister,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has alleged that the recent disruption of the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS) was an act of blackmail by the vendor, intended to pressure the government into removing key clauses from a new agreement.
According to him, the new maintenance agreement between the government and the LHIMS vendor required the company to hand over data and grant the state full administrative access to the system.
Speaking at the Government Accountability Series on Wednesday, October 29, 2025, the minister noted, however, that the vendor objected to these provisions.
To avoid this disruption and the shutdown we are experiencing, although we didnt have any contract with the vendor at the time we took over, we indicated to them that the ministry was ready to sign a service maintenance agreement covering the 450 health facilities.
Dont forget that the software is and was not for the state, that is why it is called LHIMS. In the agreement, we indicated that before we sign such an agreement with you, you have to hand over the data to the state, and you must give us administrative access to the service. The vendor insisted that those clauses must be removed from the agreement, he added.
Akandoh further noted that the governments refusal to remove the clauses prompted the vendor to intentionally disrupt the system.
We cannot expunge those clauses from the agreement because it is the state that must take charge of this data. So, the vendor decided to switch the system off as and when he desired, and demanded what he wanted. This has gone on for more than two months, and for the past two weeks or so, the system has been completely down. If this is not blackmail, I dont know what it is, he stated.
What your NHIS card can do for you
The Minister of Health further said that the government is developing a new state-owned platform, the Ghana Healthcare Information Management System (GHIMS), which will replace LHIMS and ensure national control over medical data.
Meanwhile, the breakdown of the LHIMS system has caused widespread delays in record-keeping and patient processing, particularly in the Ashanti Region, where many hospitals have reverted to manual operations.
This comes after patients expressed frustrations over prolonged waiting times and slower service delivery.
