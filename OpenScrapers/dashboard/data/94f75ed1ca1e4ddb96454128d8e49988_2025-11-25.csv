FDA seizes 98 unregistered herbal medicines in Accra,"The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has confiscated 98 unregistered herbal medicinal products during a market surveillance operation conducted between November 22 and 24, 2025, at Awoshie, and Boundary Road in Accra.




The seized items include popular products such as Amenazel Herbal Tonic, Amenazel Herbal Bitters, and Poget Herbal Mixture, all of which were being sold without the required FDA registration.


According to the Authority, the exercise forms part of ongoing nationwide efforts to protect public health by removing unapproved and potentially unsafe products from the market.


The FDA cautioned traders and manufacturers who continue to distribute unregistered products, stressing that enforcement activities will intensify in the coming weeks.


“To those selling unregistered products, we will not relent in our commitment to ensuring public health and safety, so sooner than you think we will get to you,” the Authority warned.




All seized products will undergo safe disposal in line with FDA protocols.

EOCO boss Raymond Archer on why there should be tougher bail conditions for suspects,"The Acting Executive Director of the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), Raymond Archer, has defended the ""tougher"" bail conditions being applied in recent economic crime cases, saying low sureties make it easy for suspects to evade accountability.




Speaking on Joy FM’s Newsfile programme on Saturday [November 23, 2025], the Acting Executive Director of EOCO said bail must reflect the scale of financial exposure in ongoing investigations.


“I consider bail and sureties, or I liken it to the collateral you give for a loan,” he said. “When you give collateral that is less than the loan you take, there’s no motivation to pay back.”


Mr Archer said suspects involved in economic offences cannot be treated like ordinary offenders. “Assume at every point that every criminal is at least above average. The fact that you beat the barricade compliance and everybody to steal that money tells you it's not your average job,” he stated.


He warned that lenient bail terms allow suspects in major financial cases to avoid accountability. “You can let the loans go run itself and then there’s no collateral to fall back on and you let [it] go into default. In the same way, bail is connected to a case.”




Drawing from EOCO’s work on complex financial crimes, Mr Archer said the office frequently handles cases involving vast sums. “We do a lot of investigation for the banks, for example, where somebody has stolen $90 million,” he said. “Then you give him a bail of $20 million.”


His remarks come amid public debate over the rising bail amounts seen in recent high-profile arrests.


In May 2025, the Ashanti Regional Chairman of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP), Bernard Antwi Boasiako, commonly known as “Chairman Wontumi”, was granted bail of GH¢50 million with two sureties after he was charged by EOCO for alleged financial loss to the state. Opposition MPs objected to the conditions, with the Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin calling the bond “unfair and unreasonable”.


In June, former National Food Buffer Stock Company CEO Abdul Hannan Wahab and his wife, Faiza Seidu Wuni, were granted bail of GH¢50 million and GH¢30 million, respectively. In October, the court revised the terms, raising Mr Wahab’s bail to GH¢100 million and his wife’s to GH¢50 million. Lawyers for the couple argued that the new amounts were harsh and out of proportion.



Just this November, the former Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation (BOST) Managing Director, Edwin Provencal was arrested by EOCO and initially given a GH¢60 million bail.


The court later reduced it to GH¢30 million with two sureties and a requirement to surrender his passport. EOCO has since asked the court to toughen the conditions, saying the sureties should be justified to match the state’s exposure.


Mr Archer maintained that the principle guiding EOCO’s approach is straightforward. “The exposure of the risk must be matched. If not, the Republic will have no leverage,” he said.

EU warns Ghana and Cote dIvoire to reform cocoa sector or risk losing global market share,"Ghana and neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire are facing renewed pressure from the European Union and French development partners to fast-track long-delayed reforms in the cocoa sector, amid warnings that both countries could lose competitiveness under emerging global sustainability standards.




The call came during a two-day Cocoa4Future feedback workshop in Accra, where researchers presented findings from a five-year EU- and AFD-funded project examining agroforestry systems, disease control, certification schemes, farmer livelihoods, and climate resilience across both countries.


EU officials were clear: unless agroforestry adoption accelerates, deforestation is curtailed, and labour-related risks addressed, West African cocoa could face mounting barriers under new European sustainability rules and stricter buyer requirements.


The research highlighted sector vulnerabilities and pathways for reform. Studies confirmed that many farmers prefer low- to no-shade systems, which boost short-term yields but compromise ecological resilience and long-term productivity. 


This approach, researchers warned, undermines forest recovery and leaves cocoa landscapes highly vulnerable to climate change.




On disease management, Cocoa Swollen Shoot Disease (CSSVD) remains widespread, reducing yields by up to 202 kg per hectare in severely affected farms. 


Farmer-led control methods, such as pruning infected parts or using chemicals, are largely ineffective. 


Researchers recommended intensifying rehabilitation programmes, scaling the production of CSSVD-resistant seedlings, and expanding technical training for early detection.


Certification studies showed that Fairtrade and Organic schemes significantly improve yields, incomes, and job creation, but their impact on broader food security and working conditions is uneven. 



Researchers stressed the need for stronger cooperatives, expanded extension services, affordable credit, and diversified buyer networks to improve certification outcomes.


Across all themes, the recommendations were consistent: governments must ramp up input distribution, clarify tree tenure rights, promote hybrid cocoa varieties, incentivise agroforestry adoption, and formalise support systems for farmer livelihoods, including pensions, credit, and modern farm equipment.


Development partners stressed that these evidence-based measures are critical as the global market shifts decisively toward traceable, climate-resilient, and ethically sourced cocoa—standards that Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire risk falling behind if reforms stall.

My mo Kwame Nkrumah comment was totally misunderstood  NAPO,"The running mate to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia in the 2024 election, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, says his controversial “mo Kwame Nkrumah” remark was taken out of context and completely misunderstood. 




Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Tuesday, the former Manhyia South MP insisted that the public outrage that followed the comment did not reflect his intent.


Dr Opoku Prempeh, aka NAPO, said the statement was made in a specific political moment and should not have been interpreted as an attack on Ghana’s first President. 


“At that time, you can’t go into the evidence, so I made a statement ‘mo Kwame Nkrumah’, and I subsequently had to go to Nkroful and speak to the Chiefs there and explain the contest in which the statement was made,” he said.


He explained that political communication can be easily distorted and that leaders must take responsibility when their words create confusion. 




“Because in politics, if somebody misunderstands, misquotes, or you allow your communication to be misread or to be misunderstood, you have to own it. So I owned it, and that is why I issued the statement,” he said.


Dr. Opoku Prempeh compared his remark to football banter to underscore that he was not attacking Kwame Nkrumah. 


“Not that the context was wrong. I’m a die-hard fan of Kumasi Asante Kotoko. So if I’m teasing Olympic supporters and I said ‘mo Oly fuo no’, I’m not really insulting Olympic fans. I’m just upping Kotoko fuo because I am one of them,” he explained. 





He maintained that the Nkrumah reference had been “totally misunderstood”.



The NPP running mate acknowledged the strong reaction that followed. 


“It generated a lot of uproar. Nkrumahists got furious, and I apologise to them,” he said. But he urged critics to reflect on Nkrumah’s own writings. 


“They should go and read Kwame Nkrumah’s Last Days from Guinea and look at how he described his own Convention People’s Party (CPP). He said the CPP was dead. That’s Nkrumah’s own writing, so we don’t say these things out of lack of respect. You know me. I have friends everywhere,” he noted.


Dr. Opoku Prempeh’s comment in July 2024—stating that no president, including Kwame Nkrumah, had outperformed President Akufo-Addo—triggered widespread backlash when he was unveiled as the New Patriotic Party’s running mate. 




Critics, including the Convention People’s Party, described his remark as disrespectful. The episode reignited concerns about what many opponents have called his “arrogant” public posture.


On PM Express, however, Dr Opoku Prempeh insisted that the debate was driven by misinterpretation rather than intent. 


He stressed that the statement was political rhetoric, not an attack on Ghana’s founding leader.

NDC questions NPPs appeal before seeing Kpandai ruling reasoning,"The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has criticised the New Patriotic Party (NPP) for filing an appeal against the annulment of the Kpandai parliamentary election before the official reasoning of the court ruling is released.




The criticism by Rashid Tanko Computer, Deputy Director of Elections and IT for the NDC, comes in response to the NPP’s rejection of the Tamale High Court ruling, which annulled the 2024 parliamentary election in Kpandai and ordered a fresh poll following a petition by the NDC candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal.


The party has filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of execution, insisting that the ruling is flawed and the original results remain valid.


Speaking on JoyNews’ The Pulse on Monday, November 24, Tanko Computer described the NPP’s move as premature.


“They [NPP] have spoken about going for an appeal and filing a stay of execution. But have they even looked at the reasoning behind the ruling? 




""The judge just said our petition was upheld and that the reasoning will be given to us on Friday. You have not even seen it, and you’ve gone to file for appeal. What are you appealing for? So you see how interesting the NPP can be?” he said.

"NPP rejects Kpandai election ruling, calls it dangerous and damaging to democracy","The New Patriotic Party (NPP) has strongly criticised the Tamale High Court ruling ordering a rerun of the 2024 parliamentary election in the Kpandai constituency, describing the decision as dangerous and a threat to Ghana’s democratic progress.




Speaking on JoyNews’ The Pulse on Monday, NPP Director of Elections and Research, Evans Nimako, said the party cannot accept the court’s decision, insisting it goes beyond the petitioner’s own claims.


“This cannot be a ruling that you expect the New Patriotic Party to say is a welcoming decision from a competent court of jurisdiction. For me, this is a dangerous ruling. The intent is to erode all the political and democratic gains we've made as a country,” he said.


Mr. Nimako argued that the petitioner’s case involved alleged infractions in 41 out of 152 polling stations.


Yet, the court annulled the results for the entire constituency instead of focusing on the areas in dispute.




“A petitioner comes to court with a plea that in 41 polling stations there have been some infractions, and you then give a ruling that, assuming, without admitting, that yes, the 41 had issues, the other 111, where there were no issues, should also be cancelled? What kind of dangerous ruling is this?” he questioned.


He added that the NPP won the seat by a margin of nearly 4,000 votes, securing 53.47% of the total ballots cast, and therefore finds it difficult to understand why the whole election should be annulled.


“This is a constituency the party won decisively. And you are telling me that you, the judge, will go beyond the plea of the petitioner? I don’t think this is the way to go,” he stressed.


The party has already filed an appeal, insisting that the ruling is legally flawed and must be overturned.

UK rejects Nigerias request to transfer Ekweremadu to Nigeria to complete prison sentence,"The United Kingdom has declined a request from the Nigerian government to allow former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu to complete his prison sentence in Nigeria.




Ekweremadu is serving time in a UK facility after he was found guilty in 2023 of plotting to harvest the kidney of a young man.


The former lawmaker received a jail term of nine years and eight months following the conviction, which stemmed from a high-profile organ-trafficking case that drew international attention.


Recently, the Federal Government, led by Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar, met with officials at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to discuss the case of Ekweremadu.


The delegation requested his deportation so he could serve his remaining sentence in Nigeria.Ads by




However, according to The Guardian UK, a source at the MoJ has confirmed the request was rejected.


The news platforms reported that the UK government was concerned that Nigeria could offer no guarantees that Ekweremadu would continue his prison sentence after being deported.


A source is reported to have said that: “The UK will not tolerate modern slavery and any offender will face the full force of UK law.”


With this development, Ekweremadu will remain in the UK to serve out the remainder of his sentence.



Meanwhile, his wife, Beatrice Ekweremadu, who was sentenced to four years and six months, with half spent in custody, was released earlier this year and has since returned to Nigeria.

Daughter of South Africas ex-president accuses sister of Russia recruitment plot,"One of the daughters of Jacob Zuma, South Africa's former president, has filed a criminal complaint against her sister, accusing her of recruiting men from South Africa to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war.




Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube alleged that Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, who serves as an MP, and two others tricked 17 men into fighting for Russian mercenaries.


The men were told they were travelling to Russia to train as bodyguards for Jacob Zuma's political party Mkhonto Wesizwe (MK), Zuma-Mncube's statement says.


The police say they are investigating the matter, while Zuma-Sambudla, aged 43, has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.


South Africa's government previously said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who had joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.




The men, aged from 20 to 39, were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said.


South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%. Joblessness among young people is even higher, making them especially vulnerable for recruitment, analysts say.


Zuma-Mncube said she had a ""moral obligation"" to file a police complaint against her younger sister.


Earlier this week, international financial outlet Bloomberg reported similar allegations against Zuma-Sambudla and said some men had also been recruited from neighbouring Botswana.



The allegations add to Zuma-Sambudla's legal woes - she is currently on trial over terrorism-related charges.


The MP is being prosecuted over comments she made on social media four years ago during deadly protests in South Africa, following the arrest of her father.


A week of anarchy in several parts of the country in July 2021, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead.


Zuma-Sambudla has been accused of fuelling this unrest but she says the charges against her are politically motivated.




Jacob Zuma was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to take part in an inquiry into allegations of corruption during his presidency that led to his sacking.


He subsequently formed the MK party and led it to third place in last year's elections.


The BBC has contacted MK and the Jacob Zuma Foundation for comment.

US investors explore potential of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region,"A delegation of American investors has visited Dakhla to assess the region’s fast-growing economic landscape and explore opportunities for strategic partnerships.




The team—made up of business executives from Great Neck, New York—reviewed the region’s investment climate, infrastructure developments, and sectors considered ripe for mutually beneficial collaboration.


The mission forms part of the twinning agreement between Dakhla and Great Neck, designed to strengthen economic cooperation and promote win-win partnerships.


Lior Cohen, an American investor, said the delegation aims to “develop joint projects and identify new investment opportunities in the region,” adding that they are keen on establishing long-term relationships with key local actors.


Healthcare investor Edwin Cohen Azarkian said the strong economic momentum he observed during his first visit motivated him to return for deeper engagement. He noted that Dakhla’s favourable environment presents clear opportunities for high-growth investment.




Dakhla Communal Council President, Erragheb Hormatallah, said the delegation toured the Dakhla Atlantic Port, agricultural zones, aquaculture projects, and several industrial sites—giving them a comprehensive view of the region’s development trajectory.


Ahmed Ktir, Director of the Regional Investment Centre (CRI), said the investors were “impressed by the significant progress achieved in the region, particularly in terms of infrastructure and investments.”


A presentation was also made to the delegation highlighting Dakhla’s competitive advantages, major ongoing projects, and high-potential sectors.


During the visit, the American delegation met with the Wali of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, the governor of Oued Eddahab province, the president of the Dakhla Communal Council, the CRI director, and the regional president of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM).



These meetings emphasised future cooperation prospects between Dakhla and Great Neck, investment opportunities across key sectors, and ongoing efforts to enhance investor support and strengthen the region’s attractiveness.

CJID CEO warns digital misinformation is worsening security concerns in Nigeria,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID), Dapo Olorunyomi, has cautioned that rising digital misinformation is escalating security challenges in Nigeria, stressing that the country is now dealing with “multiple pipelines of misinformation” that fuel instability.




Speaking to Myjoyonline on the sidelines of the 2025 Media and Development Conference organised by CJID in Abuja, Dapo Olorunyomi said the information landscape has become far more complex and dangerous, with false narratives spreading faster than institutions can respond.


“We used to have probably one pipeline, but today we have something like three or four,” he noted, explaining that government and security agencies now face a far more fragmented and unpredictable environment. He described the situation as “one of the biggest things” Nigeria must urgently confront.


Dapo Olorunyomi also raised concern about what he called “data colonialism”, warning that African countries risk losing control of their data to powerful global technology companies.


“All the big tech companies… we’re just pawns in their hands now,” he said. “How to wrestle control over our own data is one of the biggest challenges that we face in this new decade.”




The CJID CEO’s comments come at a time when West African governments are struggling to counter violent extremism and online propaganda that often spills into real-world conflict. 


In Nigeria, violence from bandits had become more deadly and widespread. Clashes between herders and farmers over livelihoods, which persisted in the North-Central zone and other parts of the country, further saw a resurgence in the first half of 2025. Similarly, increasing criminality was reported in the Niger Delta, together with activity by violent gangs in the South-South and South-West.


There was continued Biafran secessionist activity in the South-East, with clashes between pro-Biafran armed groups and Nigerian security forces.


Media freedom advocates have repeatedly urged authorities to strengthen digital literacy, improve transparency, and avoid heavy-handed measures that could undermine civil rights.



The 2025 Media and Development Conference, under the theme ""Reimagining Democracy, Development, and Data for the Next Decade"", brought together journalists, policymakers, researchers, and civil society groups to examine the evolving relationship between media, technology, and governance across the sub-region.

Police nab alleged Nigerian fugitive accused of murdering woman and daughter,"A 26-year-old Nigerian, who allegedly murdered a woman and her daughter in Nigeria and fled to Ghana, has been arrested at Akwatia by the Eastern South Regional Police Command. 




Victor Benjamin Fejeminrokum was arrested after police in Ghana intercepted a viral video alleging that he had abducted and murdered a lady who worked with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and her daughter at Abeokuta in Ogun State, Nigeria. 


A statement issued and signed by Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) David Fianko-Okyere, Public Relations Officer, Eastern South Region, said the suspect was wanted by the Nigerian Police but fled to Ghana and hid among friends at Akyem Wenchi, a suburb of Akwatia in the Eastern Region. 


“On receipt of the information that the suspect was hiding in his friend’s house at Akwatia, the Eastern South Regional Police Command quickly deployed an intelligence-led operation to arrest the suspect at his hideout at Akyem Wenchi,” the statement said. 


“The suspect is currently in police custody, and arrangements are underway to hand him over to the Nigerian authorities,” it said. 




“We entreat the public to report any suspicious movement of any person or group of persons in their communities to help prevent crime.” 


The statement assured the public of sustained operations to deal with criminal activities within the jurisdiction.

Man captured in viral video forcing child to smoke arrested,"The Ghana Police Service has arrested a man captured in a viral video forcing a young child to smoke what appears to be a cigarette.




The suspect, identified as Samuel Obeng Acheampong, was apprehended on Sunday, November 22, 2025, through an intelligence-led operation. The arrest followed the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection forwarding the matter to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for immediate action.


A statement signed by Chief Inspector Brigitte Babanawo, Public Relations Officer for the CID, indicated that during questioning, the suspect admitted to the act, claiming it occurred about five years ago.


Earlier, the Gender Ministry condemned the act, describing it as both abusive and illegal. It emphasised that exposing a child to harmful substances breaches the Children’s Act, 1998 (Act 560), which protects children from physical, emotional, and moral harm.


The Ministry also noted that such conduct undermines national efforts under the Early Childhood Care and Development Policy, which promotes safe and nurturing environments for young children.




The CID reminded the public that any act endangering a child’s well-being is punishable under Ghanaian law. Samuel Obeng Acheampong remains in custody, assisting investigators, and will be brought before the court.

SEC flags 33 TV stations for airing suspected money-doubling scams,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a strong warning to the public after identifying 33 television stations airing suspected fraudulent “money-doubling” investment schemes across the country.







In a public notice, the Commission said these schemes promise unusually high returns at little or no risk — a classic tactic used to deceive unsuspecting Ghanaians. It stressed that none of the operations being advertised have been approved or licensed to carry out investment activities in Ghana.


“The SEC hereby informs the public that it has not approved, authorised or licensed any of the schemes being advertised on these television channels,” the regulator said, urging viewers to be vigilant and avoid falling victim to such scams.


According to the Commission, operators of these schemes are in breach of Section 144(1) of the Securities Industry Act and Section 294(1)(b) of the Companies Act, which prohibit unlicensed public invitations and advertisements for securities-related products. Those involved could face criminal prosecution.


The warning comes amid growing concerns about the rise in financial fraud, especially following past investment scandals that affected thousands of Ghanaians. 




The SEC says it is monitoring the situation closely to safeguard investor funds and maintain confidence in the capital market.


The public has been encouraged to verify the licensing status of any investment-related firm before committing funds. For assistance, individuals may call the SEC’s toll-free line 0800 100 065, its main line 0302 768 970–2, or email info@sec.gov.gh.


The Commission reaffirmed its commitment to protecting investors and ensuring a transparent and trustworthy securities market.

CPA requests reassignment of Ofori-Attas criminal case over concerns about public confidence,"The Committee for Public Accountability (CPA) has called on the Chief Justice to reassign the pending criminal case involving former Finance Minister, Kenneth Ofori-Atta and seven others, citing growing public concerns about possible conflicts of interest and judicial neutrality.




In a statement issued on Sunday, and signed by the CPA’s Executive Chairman, Collins Owusu Amankwah the group said it had taken note of discussions on social media and other public platforms questioning whether the current configuration of the case promotes confidence in the justice system.


The matter, Republic v. Kenneth Nana Yaw Ofori-Atta & Seven Others, is currently before the Criminal Division of the Accra High Court, presided over by Justice Bertha Aninagyei.


According to the CPA, some members of the public have raised questions about “perceived associations” between Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng and persons believed to have personal or professional ties to the presiding judge.


While the group stressed that it was not making any factual conclusions about the concerns, it said perceptions alone could undermine trust in the judicial process.




“The mere perception of conflict — whether founded or unfounded — can affect public trust in the judicial process,” the statement said.


The CPA argued that high-profile cases of national interest require an environment “completely free from any appearance of bias.” It has therefore appealed to Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie to consider reassigning the case to another court.


“This request is made not as an indictment of any judge or official, but as a proactive measure to ensure that justice is not only done, but is manifestly and unquestionably seen to be done,” the group added.


The organisation reaffirmed its respect for the judiciary and expressed confidence that the appropriate administrative steps would be taken.

Swallowed by the Sea: The sad reality of Kporkporgbor and Fuveme,"The waves arrive without mercy. They slam into what used to be bedrooms, break through kitchens that once smelled of smoked fish, and swallow the land where children once ran barefoot to school. 




In Kporkporgbor and what remains of Fuveme, the ocean is not a distant horizon, it is now the neighbour that knocks down walls in the dead of night.


Once-thriving fishing villages along Ghana’s coast are becoming ghost towns. Agavedzi, Fuveme, and Salakope, Amutinu —communities that shaped the cultural spine of the Anloga and Ketu coastline, are now graveyards of memories, with the sea devouring homes, churches, cemeteries, and ancestral lands.


For 78-year-old Daavi Afi, the erasure happened in a single night. She still trembles as she recalls watching the ocean roar into her six-bedroom compound, lifting her life of 50 years and dragging it away like driftwood.





Today, she sleeps on a thin mat in her married daughter’s small hall in Dzita.




“When the sea took my house, it took my history too.”


For 12-year-old Dziedzorm, the loss is equally heartbreaking. His school—his only place of hope, collapsed into the ocean.


“I don’t go to school again,” he told JoyNews. The sea ate it.”


These are not isolated tragedies. They are the human face of a worsening climate crisis: rising sea levels, intense tidal waves, sand mining, mangrove loss, and sediment disruption from past sea defense projects have turned the coastline into a battleground where the people are losing.



Over 200 houses in Fuveme are gone. The shoreline has moved more than 100 meters inland in less than a decade. Entire families are now climate refugees, displaced into neighbouring communities with no compensation, no land, and little hope.





The sea has also salinized freshwater sources, leaving mothers walking long distances for clean water. Fishermen must now travel to other towns to launch their boats, losing precious income.


“We can’t keep burying our history,” an assembly member said. “By the time help arrives, the town is already gone.”


Beyond the wreckage is something more painful: the loss of identity. Homes built through generations are collapsing. Cemeteries have been washed away. Social networks are breaking apart as families scatter.




Every wave is a reminder of what has been taken, and what may be lost next.





Residents say the time for promises has passed. They want comprehensive coastal protection, fair compensation, sustainable relocation plans, mangrove restoration and dredging, and psychosocial support for displaced families.


If these interventions do not come quickly, more towns will disappear forever.

"No way home: Women and children stranded in Keta, Anloga and Ketu floods","The water rose silently at first, creeping under doors and soaking beds. Then it surged drowning homes, schools, and farmlands from Mepe to Keta, from Anloga to Ketu South. 




Today, for thousands of women and children, the floodwaters have taken away not just their houses, but their sense of safety.


The flooding was fuelled by a combination of heavy rains and the spillage of the Akosombo Dam between September 15 and October 30, 2023. The Volta River Authority (VRA) was forced to release water to protect the integrity of the dam, triggering a humanitarian disaster that displaced nearly 38,000 people.


In a cramped classroom in Agbledomi, Ablavi, a mother of four, shares the space with 27 other displaced persons. Her newborn survived a nighttime flood surge only because she clutched him tightly above the water.


“I screamed until my voice finished,” she told JoyNews. “Every night, I fear it will happen again.”







In Kedzi, 17-year-old Edem lives with another type of pain. His WASSCE exams were interrupted when water burst into his classroom.


“I haven’t recovered,” he admits. “I don’t know if I will write again.”


The shelters are overcrowded, wet, and unsafe. Mothers cook on small fires under leaking roofs. Children sleep on cold floors. Privacy is a luxury no one here can afford.


As floodwaters stagnate, a new threat is rising: Malaria cases are increasing, Diarrhoeal diseases are spreading, Cholera fears loom, latrines have collapsed, and open defecation is widespread.



Girls are missing school—some permanently. Mothers trade their last bowls of gari for candles and sachets of clean water.


While NADMO, humanitarian organizations, and local authorities are providing support, the scale of the crisis exposes glaring gaps in disaster preparedness.


“How long will we live like this?” a teacher asked. “How do we rebuild when we have lost everything?”


Farms worth millions of cedis are gone. Businesses destroyed. Boats and nets washed away. The economic scars may last for years.







Experts insist that what is unfolding is more than flooding, it is a humanitarian emergency requiring coordinated action.


Immediate needs: Emergency food and water, Mobile health services, Sanitary materials, Temporary shelter.


Long-term needs: Proper drainage systems, Floodplain zoning, Women-centred emergency shelters.


Women and children remain the most vulnerable, and the most forgotten. Their recovery must be at the centre of every intervention.

Migrant youth make U-turn as stakeholders develop intervention for dry spell,"In the Savannah Region of Ghana, migration has increasingly become a household mechanism in adapting to climate change. 




Dr. Shelta Gatsey, Lead of the Strategic Initiatives for African Governance, explains, ""For many young people in regions affected by climate variability, migration is often temporal or seasonal. It allows them to earn money, supplement their livelihoods when their harvests fail, and, in some cases, use remittances as a foundation to build a more secure future.""


In a remarkable turn of events, migrant youth who had previously left their homes in search of better opportunities are now returning to their communities. 


This shift follows key interventions by stakeholders designed to address the devastating effects of the dry spell in Ghana's Savannah region.


Migration, in this context, emerges not merely as a survival tactic but as a strategic adaptation to climate stress.




The Savannah Farmers Brigade (SFB), a leading agricultural organization, has launched initiatives to support farmers, primarily by promoting climate-smart agricultural practices.Testimonials of Return:


A 200-acre rice farm at the suburb of Buipe


Thirty-four-year-old Gifty Ibrahim, a native of Buipe, shared her experience of migration. 


She lost her six acres of maize and four acres of groundnuts to the dry spell, prompting her move to Kumasi in the Ashanti Region.



""The last dry spell affected my six-acre maize farm and also four acres of groundnuts and spoiled everything. So, I migrated to Kumasi and worked and sent the money home,"" she explained. ""When we travel, we'll be working and sending the money to the house so that when I return, I'll use that money to invest in a meaningful venture.""


Musah Naimah, another native of Buipe, first migrated to Accra in 2017 for greener pastures.


""I must say, all wasn't rosy there, especially what one would eat and where to sleep. But thank God, I was able to gather some money and returned home,"" Mrs. Naimah indicated.





SFB Farmers undergo training on double cropping at Buipe




These stories are increasingly common across the region, particularly in communities like Daboya, Mugrigu, Mpaha, and Bole, where migrant youth are now returning home equipped with financial and practical resources.


The Savannah Region is highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns severely affecting agricultural productivity. 


According to the Savannah Region Department of Food and Agriculture, 105,922 young farmers were affected during the 2024 cropping season, including 54,491 males and 51,431 females


To address this challenge, farmers in the region are adopting climate-smart agricultural practices that enhance resilience and sustainability.




The Double Cropping Strategy


""We're working with partners to provide climate-resilient seeds, irrigation systems, and training to enhance farmers' adaptive capacities,"" said Gbenapewura Abdalla Mahama Adam, Executive Director of the Savannah Farmers Brigade.


One effective strategy being implemented is double cropping, which involves planting and harvesting two crops in a single season. 


This approach maximises the use of the rainy season and reduces the risk of crop failure. 




Farmers can, for example, plant maize in April and harvest it in June, followed by groundnuts or cowpea in July.


Mr. Lawrence Nuzagla, a 76-year-old farmer, is among the beneficiaries of the initiative.


""I started the double-cropping initiative in 1977 here in Kongo, and I must confess that it's very helpful. Through this method, some of my children have completed school and are in the working class,"" he stated. 


""I always plant groundnuts first, quickly harvest them in June, and then farm maize. Another time, I crop beans, harvest, and plant maize. This has been very helpful because I don't spend, but I get more money from it.""




Dabapewura Seidu Abdul Fatawu, a sub-chief of Buipe and commercial farmer with a 200-acre rice farm, chairs the Savannah Farmers Brigade and strongly endorses the initiative.





""Yes, planting twice a year is possible, and we [SFB] are already practising it. We sometimes plant watermelon, and right after harvesting, we plant maize,"" said Mr Fatawu. ""Another time, we plant maize, and after harvesting, we sell it fresh, get the money, and re-crop in the same land. Many farmers are not clear about the initiative, and that is why we, as an association, are training our farmers.""


Mrs. Joyce Beyuo also attested to the method's effectiveness.


""The entire idea or initiative is very good because it reduces labour costs and the risk of losing out to the dry weather,"" she emphasised. 




""In my first season of cropping, I planted maize once, but in the second season, I realised that I could plant twice. So, I started it with groundnuts in May, and after harvesting, I put in maize. I can tell you my income doubled as compared to the previous season when I planted once. Since then, I've been cropping twice a season, and some of my colleague nurses are also doing it.""


Research and Hope for the Future


The double cropping initiative was informed by a study conducted by Professor Francis Malongza, Lecturer and Head of the Department for Community Development Studies at the University for Development Studies, Tamale campus. 


His research in Wa, Bawku West, and Bongo focused on cultural influences on agriculture.





""The farmers in these areas have something similar—the pattern of rainfall and cropping period. So, we came up with the initiative for our farmers, and I can tell you that the benefits are huge,"" Professor Malongza noted.


""This initiative will increase crop yields, reduce poverty, improve food security, and enhance resilience to climate-related shocks.""


While the dry spell has severely impacted farming communities, the combined efforts of Professor Malongza and the Savannah Farmers Brigade are offering renewed hope, enabling farmers to adapt to climate variability, improve household income, and secure a more resilient agricultural sector.





The benefits of the double cropping initiative are significant. By planting two crops in a single season, farmers dramatically increase total harvests from the same plot of land. Testimonials from farmers like Mrs. Joyce Beyuo confirms that income can double compared to single-season planting.


The initiative maximizes the use of the rainy season, reduces the risk of total crop failure, and helps bridge rural poverty gaps. Higher and more consistent yields contribute directly to food security for both households and the wider community, making this strategy a cornerstone of climate adaptation in the Savannah Region.

When the sea vomits: Are our schools and hospitals ready?,"In Ghana’s most vulnerable coastal communities, the sea is no longer just swallowing homes, it is tearing at the very foundations of public infrastructure. As the coastline retreats year after year, schools, hospitals, and health centers are edging closer to collapse.




In communities such as Fuveme, Salakope, Agavedzi, Kporkporgbor, and Kedzikope, the question hangs heavily: When the sea vomits again, where will the people run?


In Fuveme, the school compound once echoed with laughter. Today, it stands fractured, its foundation eaten by waves.


Mr. Nyatefe, the headteacher, now holds classes under trees.


“I cannot risk the children’s lives,” he told JoyNews.




“When the tide is strong, the ground shakes. We have lost too much already.”


Three school blocks along this stretch have partially collapsed. Others stand dangerously close to the shoreline.


At the Kedzikope Health Centre, nurses work while watching the sea inch closer every day.For nurse Elorm, every night brings dread.





“When the waves hit the walls, I panic,” she admits. “We cannot run fast enough if something happens.”



Ambulances can no longer access flooded roads. Pregnant women now walk up to nine kilometres for care. Medical supplies are delayed for days because transport routes are repeatedly cut by water.


Infrastructure on a Tight Rope


Experts estimate that sections of Ghana’s coastline are eroding at over five meters a year.


That rate threatens: School buildings, health facilities, water and electricity lines, and community roads.




This deterioration is fueled by sea level rise, extreme tidal waves, sand mining, mangrove loss, and decades of unmanaged coastal development.





When a school collapses, children lose their right to education. When a clinic is cut off, lives are lost. When a community road vanishes, the entire local economy stalls.


The threat is not theoretical, it is unfolding now. Experts call for a national emergency plan, not piecemeal projects. Ghana must: reinforce or relocate endangered public facilities, restore mangroves to buffer the coastline, implement sustainable dredging, and build climate-resilient infrastructure.





“The sea is moving faster than policy,” a district official warns.




“If we delay, we will lose more than buildings; we will lose lives.”

US presses Europe on rules for big tech companies,"Europe should ""reconsider"" its rules for big tech companies if it wants to see lower US tariff rates on its steel and aluminium exports, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said.




His comments come as officials from the US and European Union are meeting in Brussels to discuss the status of the trade framework that the two sides agreed on in July.


That deal set US tariff rates on European products at 15%, lower than had been threatened, in exchange for promises of European investment and changes that would allow more American agricultural products.


But the two sides remain at odds over some parts of the deal.


European officials hoped they would secure relief for their metals exports as part of the deal reached over the summer, but the US is still charging at 50% duty - and has expanded the number of products subject to the levy.




Europe is also hoping to win carve-outs from tariffs for items such as wine, cheese and pasta, similar to the rollback the Trump administration recently granted for tropical fruit and coffee.


In an update to reporters on the talks, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the US wanted to see Europe follow through on promises to lower tariffs on American goods before it would grant exemptions.


He and Mr Lutnick said the US wanted to see concessions over European rules for tech companies in exchange for changes to metals tariffs.


""They would like to have steel and aluminium as part of this package and we think it is very, very important that they understand our digital companies and they reconsider their digital regulations to be more inviting to our big companies,"" Mr Lutnick said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.



The US has long maintained that taxes on digital services - which typically charge levies on revenue from streaming or digital advertising companies above a certain size - unfairly target American firms.


US firms have also been unhappy with Europe's Digital Markets Act, which came into force last year. It was aimed at boosting competition, for example setting rules that would require a company like Apple to make its iPhones work with devices such as headphones made by other brands.


When Trump was re-elected last year, many tech firms hoped he would champion a fight over the rules and taxes, unlike the Biden administration, which was seen as leaving such battles up to the firms involved.


European officials have previously said that their digital rules were not up for negotiation. European Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said the EU had maintained that stance when the issue arose on Monday.




""This is not discriminatory. It is not aimed at American companies,"" he added.

"PureLube, ShaQ Express, SnooCODERED beat 1,800 applicants to join Commonwealth Startup Fellowship","Three Ghanaian startups have secured spots in the highly competitive accelerator programme to catapult their businesses under the Commonwealth Startup Fellowship (CSF).PureLube, ShaQ Express and SnooCODERED were selected from over 1,800 applicants across 44 eligible countries and territories globally.




PureLube, founded by Fareeda Mustapha, is developing an eco-friendly, high-performance grease made from cashew shells for automotive and industrial use.


By turning agricultural waste into a valuable industrial product, the startup is positioning itself at the intersection of sustainability, manufacturing and agribusiness.


ShaQ Express, led by Anthony Owusu-Ansah, is a tech-powered green logistics company enabling last-mile delivery in Ghana using electric bikes. The startup is working to make urban deliveries faster and cleaner while reducing emissions and offering an alternative to conventional fuel-based dispatch services.


Health-tech startup, SnooCODERED, founded by Dr Nana Serwaa Quao, delivers emergency logistics software to improve healthcare in hard-to-reach areas. Its solution is designed to help get critical medical supplies and support to underserved communities more quickly and efficiently.All three Ghanaian startups will participate in the Commonwealth Startup Fellowship (CSF), which empowers early-stage entrepreneurs from across the Commonwealth to address development challenges through innovation and enterprise.They will begin their journey with a bootcamp in Accra from 17–28 November, hosted at Affinity Africa, founded by Imperial College London alumnus Tarek Mouganie. Two of the Fellows from Ghana are being funded by Imperial Global Ghana, Imperial’s African hub based in Accra.




This year’s cohort includes 23 Fellows drawn from low- and middle-income Commonwealth countries including Bangladesh, Botswana, Ghana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Uganda. Over six months, the founders will take part in workshops, mentorship and coaching to kick-start their business development journey, culminating in an investor showcase in London in May 2026.The Fellowship, a flagship programme of the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission (CSC) funded by the UK government and delivered in partnership with Imperial College London, is designed to help high-potential startups like PureLube, ShaQ Express, and SnooCODERED build thriving businesses, scale their operations and drive job creation in their home countries.Associate Director of Imperial Global Ghana, Clare Turner, noted that the three Ghanaian entrepreneurs are tackling real-world challenges with bold, locally driven innovation, and that connecting them to Imperial’s global networks will help unlock new opportunities for growth and impact across West Africa.Professor Robin Mason, Chair of the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, said the Commission looks forward to seeing the Fellows flourish over the next six months and contribute to the Commonwealth’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, noting that the programme is showing what is possible when higher education, industry and decision makers work together with a shared vision for a better world.

"Achieving science, technology and innovation adoption targets set out in 2026 budget for Ghana","On 13th November 2025, Finance Minister Dr Cassiel Ato Forson presented the 2026 National Budget and Economic Policy to Parliament, which featured key priority areas that the government aims to focus on in the ensuing year. The theme for the budget was “Resetting for Growth, Jobs and Economic Transformation”.Ghana has long envisaged digitalising various sectors of the economy to promote efficiency, effectiveness and transparency. The NDC government, in continuing this initiative, has spelt out many technology-driven initiatives in the new budget.These include the National Coders’ Programme, Farmer Service Centres, Retooling the Ghana Armed Forces and the Ghana National Fire Service and VAT Fiscal Electronic Devices.This article seeks to highlight some possible risks associated with the implementation of some selected key science, technology and innovation adoption policies captured in the budget and preferred solutions to ensure their effective implementation.




One Million Coders ProgrammeThe ruling NDC has long touted the “One Million Coders Programme” as one of its key interventions to address the digital divide and hone the skills of the youth for the 4th industrial revolution.Launched in May 2025, the initiative is empowering Ghanaians with coding skills and preparing them for the future job market. The Programme, currently run under the Ministry of Communication, Digital Technology and Innovations, aims at promoting digital innovation and skills development. The government in the 2025 budget statement allocated 100 million cedis for its implementation.The programme, expected to run for 4 years, has seen another allotment in the 2026 budget statement of another 100 million-cedi intervention. While this initiative is laudable, it has its challenges, risks that could affect its effective and efficient rollout. Key among them are: digital access, digital literacy and language barriers.


Digital access in rural areas and some parts of the urban areas in the capital is one of the key stumbling blocks that could affect the effective implementation of the programme, since people in these areas lack personal computers and small devices.To continue, language barriers and digital literacy must be addressed to fully realise the potential of this initiative.


Farmer Service CentresAnother key area supporting technological advancement is the implementation of Farmer Service Centres, where the government intends to support farmers with modernised machines to promote efficient farming and strengthen food security. These machineries include tractors, tillers, cultivators, ploughs, harrows, cutter bars, mowers, fertiliser spreaders, seed drills, sprayers, harvesters, among others.


The government made a 690-million-cedi allocation for this intervention, which is a huge investment as the government intends to build a country that produces more than it consumes and increase exportation.




While this is a commendable initiative in mechanisation, the agriculture sector and enhancing food security would require that beneficiaries, particularly smallholder farmers, are trained to be adept at harnessing these tools for increased productivity. Oversight duties must be done to ensure the rightful beneficiaries gain access to these tools.


Retooling the Armed Forces and Fire ServiceFurthermore, the government aims to strengthen national security and firefighting efforts through retooling the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) and the Ghana National Fire Service with advanced and modern technologies. To implement this initiative, beginning with the Army, the government has moved to renegotiate the US$80 million ELBIT Systems contract, to secure 19 Armoured Personnel Carriers needed to boost ground Readiness. The Navy will acquire two 72-meter Offshore Patrol Vessels fitted with helipads and modern combat systems. To protect Ghana’s maritime borders, offshore energy Assets, and trade routes. These ships will restore control over our Exclusive Economic Zone and strengthen national resilience at sea. For the Air Force, procurement will begin in 2026 for four new helicopters and two aircraft to enhance airlift, Patrol, and emergency response operations. The government will retool the Ghana National Fire Service with 100 fire tenders and assorted fire equipment while liaising with the private sector to bring in high-rise fire equipment.


AI for pre-arrival inspections at the portsIn the reading of the national budget, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson stressed on how the recent audit revealed systemic weaknesses in classification, valuation, and cargo inspection. In 2024 alone, Ghana recorded imports valued at 204 billion cedis (CIF), yet only 85 billion was taxable, pointing to misclassification and under-invoicing. To tackle this, the government will deploy AI-driven pre-arrival inspections for all cross-border shipments. This technology is programmed to detect under-valuation, flag high-risk goods, and strengthen Customs’ capacity to combat smuggling, improve safety, and protect national security. By integrating automation into port operations, we expect to significantly boost customs revenue, enhance trade efficiency, and close long-standing revenue gaps.


Promoting STEM EducationIn the Education sector, another feature of the use of Science, technology and innovation to promote efficiency is the construction of science and ICT laboratories, which was highlighted in the budget. The minister emphasises the reality that “while Category A schools receive overwhelming demand, Category C schools, which hold more than half of available spaces, remain under-enrolled due to infrastructure and quality gaps. “This inequity must end, and it will end. Rt. Hon. Speaker, we will accordingly;Upgrade another 30 Category C schools to Category B level, with new classrooms, dormitories, modern resource centres, digital learning centres and water and sanitation systems”, the minister noted.This will be drawn from the 33.3 billion cedis budgetary allocation to the Education Sector. Some issues that may arise, as is mostly noticed, are abandoned projects due to funds not being released on time for effective implementation within the timelines.



Women’s Development Bank to support businessesAn initiative highlighted in the budget that falls under innovation is the Women’s Development Bank, where the government seeks to restore confidence in women-led start-up businesses to boost MSMEs and reduce the burden of high interest rates and collateral loans from other lending agencies. In 2025, the government invested 51.3 million cedis in the establishment of the bank, and to reiterate the importance of the initiative, the invested 401 million cedis to support the bank in the 2026 budget, not just to cover the seed capital to start the bank of 400 million cedis, but also to use 1 million cedis for the establishment of the bank. But a common risk that affects all banks and might hinder the successful implementation of the initiative is incurring bad debts after giving out loans to its customers, and until measures are put in place to tackle this issue, it is bound to repeat itself.





ConclusionSummarily, the 2026 National Budget demonstrates the government’s continued commitment to leveraging science, technology, and innovation as critical enablers of national development, job creation, and institutional reform. The outlined initiatives—from the One Million Coders Programme and Farmer Service Centres to the retooling of the security services, deployment of AI-driven customs systems, expansion of science and ICT laboratories, and the establishment of the Women’s Development Bank—illustrate a deliberate effort to reset the economy for inclusive growth and transformation.However, as highlighted, these high-impact interventions are not without risks. Challenges such as limited digital access, language and literacy barriers, infrastructural gaps, procurement delays, and the persistent threat of bad loans in financial support schemes must be anticipated and proactively addressed. Effective implementation will therefore require not only adequate funding but also strong monitoring mechanisms, timely release of resources, cross-sectoral coordination, and continuous capacity building.


Ultimately, the success of these science, technology and innovation policies hinges on the government’s ability to translate intentions into action, ensuring that every cedi invested yields measurable improvements in efficiency, transparency, productivity, and equity. If these risks are mitigated and the proposed solutions embraced, the 2026 budget has the potential to significantly accelerate Ghana’s journey toward digital advancement, economic resilience, and shared national prosperity.

The stuff under the stuff: People with hoarding disorder open up,"The habit crept up on Kim. She would arrive at garage sales as they were ending to pick up what remained.




“I’d load my car full of the free stuff on the side of the road: clothes, things that needed to be fixed, projects,” she told CNN.


It was only once things spiraled that Kim, 53, who asked to be identified by her first name to protect her privacy, realized she had a problem that was all too familiar: hoarding, a disorder that she’d spent years urging her mother to seek help for.


“I used to get very frustrated and say, ‘Mom, we’ve helped you clean out this room 10 times, and we come back three months later and it’s completely full of sh*t ,” she said.


“I learned about hoarding disorder when I was younger but somehow didn’t recognize it in myself.”




At first, Kim would pile the things around her bed and throughout her bedroom, eventually expanding into other areas of her home, including her living room and sunporch.


Besides the garage sales, she would collect stuff at thrift stores and stored goods she said family gave her “to hold and keep.”


What is hoarding?





Today Kim runs a Facebook support group for 2,100 people with hoarding disorder, which the World Health Organization categorized as a mental health condition in 2018, five years after the condition was added to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. HD is characterized by excessive accumulation of possessions and difficulty in disposing of them .



Kim only sought help when things became unsafe. “The stuff starts piling up, the paths get narrower, and you start to trip (in your own house),” said the single mother.


“Putting things in the garbage is a big struggle — if we know it might go to the right home, that makes us feel better.“


She thinks that mindset dates back to what her grandmother used to say: “Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without,” she said. “That was a phrase that was knocked into my head ever since I was little,” and it makes her worry about wasting anything.


What people hoard varies: Kim’s focus is books. “It would have taken me 10 lifetimes to read them,” she said of the many boxes she gave away after extensive therapy, including “500 Dr. Phil books.”




Two-thirds of people with the disorder have at least one other psychiatric condition, while physical comorbidities such as arthritis and diabetes are common, according to a 2024 US Senate report. Around 14 million Americans are affected by hoarding disorder, with similar rates across other Western countries.


Hoarding can trigger countless complications, experts say. Bathrooms and kitchens can become unusable, impacting diet and personal hygiene. Housing authorities can threaten eviction leading to homelessness, while in extreme cases children have been removed by social services.


There is also risk to life. Excessive stuff, especially books and paperwork, pose a serious fire hazard and can hamper rescue efforts by blocking escape routes.


Why do people hoard?


Collecting may be in our DNA, according to Dr. Nick Neave, a professor in the psychology department at Northumbria University in the United Kingdom and director of the university’s Hoarding Research Group.




“Throughout history possessions have always been very important — you see people buried with grave goods,” he said. “That urge to collect things, it’s part of your personality, your culture. So hoarding is normal — we’ve all got stuff we don’t need.”


What separates regular collecting from hoarding is often trauma, Neave said.


“All the people who hoard I’ve ever met had traumatic childhoods, whether it’s physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, chaotic backgrounds, lack of parents.”


This resonates with Kim, whose symptoms emerged after she experienced an abusive relationship, the death of a friend and a serious medical diagnosis.




“We call it the stuff under the stuff,” said Kim, who lives in New York state. “One of our therapists calls it the one, two, three punch. You can handle one trauma, maybe two, but after that, a lot of people will have hoarding disorder creep in.”


“I tried to fill the hole in my heart and soul with the stuff,” she added.


Neave says hoarding is a “coping strategy which starts off working very well” but can “spiral quickly into a severe addiction and mental health problem that is very difficult to resolve.”


Shame and stigma can then lead to further isolation, he said. “The obvious thing to do is get rid of the clutter, but that doesn’t solve the problem of why they’ve got it in the first place. If you’re not treating that issue, it’ll come back.”

"Nude beach etiquette: Lose your clothes, not your manners","Most of us have felt the freedom and delight that comes with stripping down to a swimsuit on a sunny day and wading into a cool sea, the horizon twinkling in the distance.




But what of shedding those final strips of fabric and going nude? The birthday suit is, after all, the world’s oldest costume and one that never goes out of style.


The naturist movement emerged in Europe at the end of the 19th century and is now popular around the world. Globally, there are hundreds of clothing-optional beaches where it’s perfectly legal to drop your shorts and your inhibitions, and the number is growing.


Fans of naturism can now take nude cruises around the Caribbean or plan a naked wedding on an Italian island.


If you’re a newbie to nudity but are interested in knowing more, we have some tips on beach and resort etiquette from naturism experts with decades of unclothed experience. Here’s their dos and don’ts and what you should know before you go.




1. Do your research


“Naturism means different things to different people and the term is sometimes misused,” says Stéphane Deschênes, president of the International Naturist Federation (INF-FNI), the world’s only global naturism organisation. “So you have to understand what you’re looking for.”


There’s no single naturist ideology, but typically the lifestyle is about non-sexual social nudity in a family-friendly environment.


“Fortunately, naturism has always been very well organized,” says Deschênes. The INF-FNI aims to help people find consistency and reliability when choosing naturist resorts and has been doing so for more than 70 years.


2. Take the plunge


So you’ve arrived at your chosen beach or resort and you feel like everyone’s looking at you. They’re not.



“Nobody knows this is your first time,” says Ronna Krozy, a retired professor in her 80s who’s been a nudist for more than 30 years. In 2023, she showed CNN the ropes at Solair Recreation League, a family nudist resort and campground in Woodstock, Connecticut.


“In fact, it might be easier to go to somewhere with tons of people and just get on with it, or better yet, get everything off,” she says.


Like going into the water itself, sometimes it’s better just to dive straight in.


3. Keep your distance


Behave like you’re at a “church picnic,” says Krozy, who is also public relations chair at the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR), the leading naturist organisation in the United States.




“Don’t park your chair or your blanket too close to anybody,” she adds. “Anything that appears like sexual activity, like plastering your body against somebody else, is not allowed.”


And while nudists are known for packing light, there’s one item you should never be without.


“Always bring a towel with you to sit on, because that is for everybody’s hygiene.”


4. Don’t stare or take photos


Making eye contact? Starting up a friendly conversation? All this is more than welcome says Krozy. “Look people in the eye, because that might help you to figure out where to put your attention, and don’t gawk or stare because that is considered rude and impolite.”




Sunglasses are, of course, a common beach accessory – but don’t try hiding behind them to sneak a peek at your neighbors.


Taking pictures or videos without people’s permission is also a huge no-no.  Just because you lose your clothes doesn’t mean you should lose your manners.


It’s simply decent human conduct to not be “too aggressive” or “make people uncomfortable by not giving them enough space,” says Deschênes. “These are all sensible things to do in all situations.”


5. Don’t comment on people’s bodies


“You shouldn’t talk about anybody’s body, even if you think it’s a compliment,” says Krozy.




While we live in an increasingly open-minded society when it comes to displaying flesh, it’s a double-edged sword, says Deschênes. “In some ways, people are less shocked by the idea of nudity, but in another, that nudity has generally been hypersexualized and objectified.”


A common misperception, he says, is that “people often think naturism is about not wearing clothes. But that’s not the objective. That’s simply the tool that we use to achieve body acceptance.”


The happy upshot of this, he says, is that “it creates better relationships between people because they are more open and honest and true about who they are in themselves.” 


Clothing isn’t just a protective covering, Deschênes says. “Mostly clothing is about rank and status and hiding who we are and trying to make ourselves look in a way that society tells us you’re supposed to be.”




6. Arousal isn’t the problem you think it is


Both Krozy and Deschênes say that one of the questions they’re most often asked is what happens if a man gets physically excited. The truth is, it doesn’t happen that often.


“It’s a great fear,” since Deschênes, “and it’s understandable since most men have spent their entire life connecting nudity and sex.”


However, the non-sexual nature of the environment in general means it’s a rare occurrence, he says, and also, “when you’re very nervous as a man, it doesn’t work very well.”


Krozy has this advice, however, for any guy who finds himself caught out: “Take your towel and cover yourself. Turn over in the sand. Run into the cold water.” If all else fails, focus on dull thoughts like “taking out your garbage.”




Likewise, a common question from women is what they should do if they’re on their period. The answer is that they should do whatever makes them feel most comfortable.


They can wear underwear if they prefer pads, they can use menstrual cups if that’s their style, or if they like tampons, they can use those too. “You know, if somebody sees the string, that’s okay,” says Deschênes. “Having a period is a normal part of life.”


7. Don’t get your alternative lifestyles confused


In our globalized, hyperconnected world, communities of like-minded people can find each other with greater ease than ever before, making it a golden age for alternative lifestyles. But don’t be tempted to think of discrete communities of naturists, nudists, polyamorists, ethical non-monogamists and fetish enthusiasts as one big bundle.


“We always get lumped in with the sexually liberated people and that’s never been who we are and still isn’t,” says Deschênes. “There’s nothing wrong with all those other communities – my only problem is when you mix them up. A friend of mine gave a really good analogy. He said, ‘You can play tennis, and you can play baseball, but you don’t try to play baseball on a tennis court.’”


8. Enjoy the experience? Then explore more


So you’ve explored your local options and now you want to go further afield. “In terms of scale. France is by far the No.1 destination for naturism and has been for many years,” says Deschênes. “They’ve always had the advantage of having lots of nice beaches, the ocean and the sea.”


Germany has lots of great naturist opportunities too, and because of the long-standing cultural acceptance of nudity, you can sometimes shed your garments in less formal settings, such as parks. It’s also very common in spas - he recommends the Taunus Thermae, just outside of Frankfurt.


“You might not think of Thailand, for example, as a naturist destination, but there are some lovely resorts there,” says Deschênes. 


“It’s very limited to those resorts, because the culture generally is not favorable to naturism. But there are some beautiful resorts, and the country is very accepting of them. Then of course, there are lots of opportunities in the Caribbean, and even South America.”


This advice in hand, all you need to do is start packing. Don’t forget the sunscreen.

Ticks are taking over city parks  heres how to avoid them,"In the compact backyards of Staten Island, Maria Diuk-Wasser was surprised by what she saw. Ticks—and lots of them—nestled in wood piles, between leaves, and underneath bird feeders. It was more than she found in the previous year and the year before that.




Diuk-Wasser, a disease ecologist at Columbia University, had been tracking tick activity in the New York City borough for four years ending in 2021, and found that, year after year, ticks were expanding both in numbers and geographically. “There were many more ticks in more of the parks, and more and more backyards,” Diuk-Wasser says. And early data suggest a similar phenomenon may be unfolding nearby in Queens and Brooklyn. 


What’s happening across New York City is reflective of a larger trend: Tick populations are booming across the United States—as are tickborne diseases, like Lyme disease, which have more than doubled over the past two decades. And when there’s an explosion of ticks, we inevitably see more of them crawling across cities, says Diuk-Wasser. 


Indeed ticks, as growing evidence shows, are an emerging urban threat. Here’s what you need to know about where to find them—and how to protect yourself from tickborne diseases.


How do ticks get into cities anyway?


There are multiple species of tick, but in the United States, researchers are most concerned with four—the black-legged (deer) tick, the lone star tick, the dog tick, and the longhorned tick. Many have been venturing into regions they haven’t historically called home, and they’re multiplying.




Back in Staten Island, for example, Diuk-Wasser and her team recently recorded a startling spike in deer ticks (long-term residents of the eastern U.S.), lone star ticks (which have historically been concentrated in southeastern and south-central states) and longhorned ticks (which were found for the very first time in the U.S. in 2017). “They really spread in a matter of years. It was very fast,” she says.


But what’s really alarming is the rise of the one species that causes Lyme disease—the black-legged deer tick. According to Diuk-Wasser, these arthropods can live in any area that’s forested or contains leaf litter—the layer of dead leaves, twigs, and plant debris that provide ticks with the thick humidity they need to stay hydrated. That means a leafy park in the city can be just as attractive as the undisturbed woods they’ve commonly used as habitat.


And ticks have moved into these parks by hitchhiking on the backs other animals. Ticks can exist wherever there are hosts—whether that be raccoons, mice, birds, squirrels, or possums. That’s why you’ll even find ticks in Central Park, a greenspace famously landlocked by concrete.


But in order to truly thrive, ticks require deer. As such, the biggest factor that influences whether an urban tick community will swell is if there’s a pathway for deer to enter. “As long as deer visit, you will find ticks,” Diuk-Wasser says. For example, ticks were able to take up residence in Staten Island on the backs of the deer that swim to the borough from New Jersey.



What’s causing so many ticks to invade cities?


Let’s start with land use changes. Ticks long occupied the land where cities now stand, but were displaced in the 1800s as forests were knocked down for agricultural purposes—forced to go wherever trees were lush and leaves were moist. But as farming declined in the U.S. in the 1900s and people abandoned their pastures, areas near cities were reforested—and many towns and cities on the East Coast and up in the Great Lakes were built smack in the middle of those forests, says Nick Takacs, a Northeastern University biology professor who studies ticks. In the years that followed, wildlife—including deer and white-legged mice—returned, ticks in tow.


“We densely colonized a lot of their environments, so they had no choice but to adapt and live in the environments we shared,” Takacs says.


Many of the animals that make for ideal tick hosts actually prefer to hunt and live near what’s called ""the edge""—the space where two habitats like the woods (that offer protection) and grasslands (rich with edible vegetation) collide. So as we’ve built sprawling cities near and in forests, wildlife has migrated to the edge and into nearby parks and backyards, transporting ticks with them, says Diuk-Wasser. It doesn’t help that deer populations are multiplying due to increased hunting restrictions and fewer predators. The same is happening with mice.


At the same time, climate change is majorly impacting tick activity. Decades ago, ticks would die out come winter, but warmer weather has extended tick season. “Adult ticks can be active in the winter if it’s above 40 degrees, which happens all the time now,” says Diuk-Wasser.




Additionally, regions that were once too frigid for ticks are now suitable for them. Deer ticks and lone star ticks—plus the pathogens they carry—are moving further north, planting roots all along the Eastern seaboard, New England, and into Canada. Ticks can now feed and breed year-round. They’re proliferating—in rural spaces and urban ones.


Even the deadly brown dog tick, which becomes more active and aggressive in extreme heat, is infiltrating California cities, says Janet Foley, a veterinarian and disease ecologist at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Once found in rural desert areas, these ticks are finding places to thrive in cities that are getting both warmer and dryer. “The hotter it gets, the more likely they are to feed on anything,” she says. 


How should you protect yourself from ticks in cities?


The odds you’ll be exposed to an infected tick in a city park is on par with the chance you’ll run into one on a wooded hike. In some cities, roughly 20 to 30 percent of baby ticks (nymphs) are infected with the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, research shows. “You do see cases where people acquired Lyme disease from urban parks,” says Foley.


Therefore, you should protect yourself in certain urban greenspaces the same way you would if you were hiking or camping. You don’t need to worry as much about being bitten in Central Park (though, yes, it has ticks too), but if you’re visiting a city park or backyard that wildlife can access from nearby woods? It’s a good idea to use DEET, wear permethrin-treated clothing, and check yourself for ticks, says Diuk-Wasser. If you wander off the main trails, try not to brush alongside high grasses as that’s where ticks cling to stems, waiting for you.




This isn’t to deter you from being in nature—it’s just to inform you that ticks are all around us, even where there are taxis and stadiums. “Our cities are not as domesticated as we thought they were,” says Takacs. “We have to adapt to that.”

Nigeria: Uproar as 18-year-old boy impregnates 10 girls in Anambra,"An 18-year-old randy boy has impregnated no fewer than 10 girls in Anambra State.




The Anambra State Commissioner for Women’s Affairs and Social Welfare, Ify Obinabo, disclosed this in a social media video, saying the matter was brought before her on Tuesday.


Two of the pregnant girls are his master’s daughter and salesgirl, while the eight others were impregnated just two months after he returned to the village, having been sent packing by his boss.


According to Obinabo, in a live video she shared on social media seeking advice, she said: “I want advice from the public because this one is beyond my capacity.


“This boy was sent to learn a trade at the age of 18 and, three months into the apprenticeship, he impregnated his oga’s daughter and his salesgirl. He was sent packing. Two months after that, he impregnated eight others in the village.




“The mother reported the matter to my office, saying anytime she sees a girl coming towards her house nowadays, her heart would jump and that she needs help.


“This matter is beyond me; that’s the reason I want the public to help me come up with a solution. Is it spiritual?


“I asked the boy the magic he uses in luring the girls to bed, but he told me he always tells them that he loves them and would like to marry them anytime he acquires wealth.”


She said: “This problem is beyond me because of the boy’s age and the number of pregnant girls involved. That’s why I need help to solve it.”

"Transcending Borders: Perfect Compassion Initiatives International Outreach in springs, South Africa","In a profound demonstration of Christ-centered international outreach, Lady Perfect Anette Agbemabiese, Founder of Perfect Compassion Initiative, Perfect Prayer Palace and Ladies in Christ (LIC), led a transformative visit to the Elderly Home in Springs, South Africa to minister love, compassion, and hope to the home's predominantly white residents, aged 60 and above.




 INTERNATIONAL CHARITY: BUILDING BRIDGES OF RECONCILIATION


This remarkable mission highlights the vital role of international Christian charities in bridging racial, cultural, and geographical divides. In a world still grappling with the legacy of racial division, particularly in South Africa's historical context, Perfect Compassion Initiative's visit stands as a living testament to the reconciling power of Christ's love—a love that transcends ethnicity, nationality, and history.





The Apostle Paul declared, ""There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"" (Galatians 3:28). This scriptural truth was beautifully embodied as Ghanaian believers served South African elders, demonstrating that the Body of Christ knows no racial boundaries. Such acts of cross-cultural service dismantle prejudice more effectively than any policy, offering tangible evidence that God's kingdom operates on principles of unity, not division.





ALIGNMENT WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS




Perfect Compassion Initiative's mission aligns strategically with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly:


SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being): Addressing the physical, emotional, and spiritual health needs of elderly populations who often experience loneliness, depression, and inadequate care.





SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Actively working to reduce inequalities based on age, race, and socioeconomic status by ensuring vulnerable elderly populations receive compassionate care regardless of background.


SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): Demonstrating how international faith-based organizations can forge partnerships across borders to address humanitarian needs that transcend national interests.






By integrating biblical principles with global development frameworks, Perfect Compassion Initiative models a holistic approach to Christian service—one that honors both the spiritual and practical dimensions of human flourishing.





LOVE IN ACTION: THE VISIT


During their time at the elderly home, the Perfect Compassion Initiative team didn't merely deliver charity—they delivered presence. They spent meaningful time with residents, offering prayers, and speaking words of encouragement that affirmed each person's inherent dignity and worth.





The joy and gratitude visible on the residents' faces bore witness to the transformative power of genuine Christian compassion.







Madam Pierre, a 90-year-old resident who has called Springs Elderly Home her residence for the past 27 years, served as the leader of the residents during the visit. With deep emotion and gratitude, she thanked the Perfect Compassion Initiative team for their generosity and the love they had traveled so far to share. Her words, spoken on behalf of her fellow residents, affirmed the profound impact of this ministry—a reminder that acts of kindness ripple far beyond the moment, touching hearts and bridging worlds.





As a practical expression of care, the team served 200 packed lunches to the residents, ensuring not only spiritual encouragement but also physical nourishment—a reminder of Jesus' ministry, which consistently attended to both soul and body.


 STRENGTHENING GHANA-SOUTH AFRICA RELATIONS


This visit also highlights the deepening relationship between Ghana and South Africa, two nations with shared histories of struggle, resilience, and faith. By reaching across borders in the spirit of Christian brotherhood, Perfect Compassion Initiative demonstrates that our shared commitment to justice, equality, and human dignity transcends political boundaries.




Such international cooperation among African nations models Pan-African solidarity rooted not in mere rhetoric but in sacrificial service. It declares that we are rising to fulfill our calling as a light to the nations, ministering healing where there has been hurt, and building bridges where there have been barriers.


A CALL TO REMEMBRANCE AND ACTION


Perfect Compassion Initiative's mission to Springs Elderly Home exemplifies international Christian cooperation —compassion without condescension, service without superiority, love without limits. Under Lady Perfect Anette Agbemabiese's visionary leadership, this ministry continues to embody the heart of Christ for the marginalized, the forgotten, and the vulnerable.


""Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."" – James 1:27

EU shifting focus from development aid to investment support in Ghana  Ambassador Skinnebach,"The European Union (EU) is shifting its cooperation with Ghana from traditional development grants to more sustainable investment partnerships, according to the EU Ambassador to Ghana, Rune Skinnebach.




Speaking on the Joy Super Morning Show on Tuesday, Ambassador Skinnebach said the new approach aims to create conditions that make Ghana more attractive to investors by improving infrastructure, governance, and respect for human rights.


“We are moving away from development grants, and we are moving towards investments,” he said. 


“What we can do, because we still have grants here in Ghana, is that we can create an environment that makes Ghana attractive for investment so the country can benefit from this investment package.”


He noted that the EU is already supporting initiatives that strengthen transport systems and governance structures as part of efforts to enhance Ghana’s investment climate.




The Ambassador added that Ghana’s global reputation on human rights and universal freedoms also plays a critical role in securing long-term investor confidence. 


“It requires infrastructure. We are doing it. It requires governance. We are doing it. It also requires reputation when it comes to human rights and universal freedoms, and we’re doing it,” he emphasised.


The EU’s new development cooperation model reflects a broader strategy across Africa, where the bloc is prioritising trade, private sector growth, and sustainable investments over direct aid. 


In Ghana, this aligns with government efforts to attract foreign capital through initiatives such as the Ghana CARES ‘Obaatan pa’ programme and economic diversification plans.

Grenada seeks to recruit Ghanaian nurses to address severe health worker shortage,"The Government of Grenada has announced its intention to recruit Ghanaian nurses and allied health professionals to help address a critical shortage of health workers in the Caribbean nation. 




The move aligns with Ghana’s Work Abroad Programme aimed at creating more job opportunities for skilled professionals.


This was disclosed during the inaugural Ghana–Grenada political consultation in Accra, led by Dickon Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, who is on a three-day state visit. 


The visit is expected to deepen bilateral relations between the two countries in key areas, including health, education, climate change, trade, and investment.


Grenada’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Export Development, Joseph Andall, highlighted the country’s urgent need for nurses, describing it as one of their most pressing national challenges.




“We welcome the initiative that has been undertaken in terms of the provision of health care professionals, namely nurses. This is an area in which we have a severe shortage,” he said. 


“We spend huge sums of money to train our nurses and then they are approached by countries that can afford to give them better remuneration packages.”


Joseph Andall explained that the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two governments will serve as a framework for structured collaboration in health. 


He added that the partnership also reflects a shared commitment to Pan-African solidarity and mutual development.



“This MoU, when signed, will be a testament to what can be achieved when sisters and brothers come together for mutual assistance,” he noted.


Ghana’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, said the government is keen on leveraging such partnerships to create opportunities for Ghanaian professionals while strengthening South-South cooperation.


“On health cooperation, we particularly welcome Grenada’s interest in recruiting Ghanaian nurses and allied health professionals and look forward to the signing of the memorandum of understanding on health cooperation, which will serve as a framework for this structured collaboration,” he said.


He added that the discussions also covered education and skills development, with a commitment to address challenges faced by some Ghanaian students in Grenada under the Scholarship Secretariat.




The Ghana–Grenada talks also touched on broader areas of collaboration, including trade and investment, climate change, tourism, and multilateral engagements.


Joseph Andall stressed the importance of partnerships between Africa and the Caribbean, noting that small island states like Grenada — with a population of about 120,000 — depend on strong international cooperation to address shared challenges such as climate vulnerability and economic migration.


“We are tiny islands in the Caribbean with very small populations. A rising and strong Africa could help lift our sisters and brothers in South and Central America out of the difficulties they are currently facing,” he added.


Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell’s visit is expected to conclude with a series of high-level engagements with John Dramani Mahama and other government officials, aimed at formalising agreements and strengthening bilateral relations between Ghana and Grenada.

Family of Ghanaian US Postal worker who died in custody demands justice after stroke was mistaken for drug impairment,"A newly filed federal lawsuit alleges that a Minnesota postal worker died after police officers and jail staff ignored clear signs he was suffering from a massive stroke - mistaking his medical emergency for drug impairment. 




The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses the City of Eagan and Dakota County of deliberate indifference in the death of 50-year-old Kingsley Fifi Bimpong, a U.S. Postal Service employee and lawful permanent U.S. resident originally from Ghana. 


The lawsuit claims arresting officers failed to do a proper screening to determine whether Bimpong was having a stroke or experiencing a drug overdose – and it says jail guards allowed Bimpong to remain helpless on a jail cell floor in his own urine for hours without medical attention. 


The Night of the Arrest


On the night of November 16, 2024, Bimpong vanished from his shift at the Eagan Postal Distribution Center after complaining of a headache. 




At 10:44 PM, an Eagan police sergeant saw his car driving the wrong way on Pilot Knob Road - into oncoming traffic and striking a median curb. 


According to police reports, after being pulled over, Bimpong appeared extremely confused. He couldn’t say where he lived or worked, even though he was wearing a USPS vest, and repeatedly said, “I don’t know.” Officers noted there was no smell of alcohol. 


Bimpong, in his USPS vest, told Eagan police he didn't know where he worked or lived


Eagan Officer Martin Jensen, a specially trained Drug Recognition Evaluator (DRE), was called to assess whether Bimpong was under the influence of drugs. DRE training, provided by the Minnesota State Patrol to officers, emphasizes distinguishing drug impairment from medical emergencies such as strokes. 


But the lawsuit alleges Jensen disregarded his training.  



According to the lawsuit, body camera audio captured him saying a full DRE evaluation, which typically takes between 30-to-45-minutes, would be “a whole bunch of time wasted.” When another officer questioned whether Bimpong should be taken to the hospital, Jensen replied: “For what?” 


Eagan police officer Martin Jensen did not complete his Drug Recognition Evaluation on Bimpong, but arrested him on suspicion of DWI


Instead, Bimpong was arrested for suspected DWI. He had his blood drawn at Eagan police headquarters and was then transported to the Dakota County Jail. 


Hours Suffering in a Jail Cell


At the jail, video shows Bimpong stumbling, unable to complete the booking process. He was placed in a holding cell, where he fell, urinated on himself repeatedly, and writhed on the floor. Guards conducting legally-mandated well-being checks repeatedly wrote “inmate and cell OK” in the official jail logs – even though security video showed him sprawled across the floor in his own waste, unable to stand.




Dakota County Jail guards' wellbeing checks documented Bimpong as ""inmate and cell OK"" as he laid on the floor in his own waste


For more than three hours, correctional officers can be seen walking past his cell while he lay on the floor in obvious distress. The jail nurse was not called until a female guard noted he was foaming at the mouth and having seizure-like activity. Assuming a drug overdose, based on his DWI arrest by the DRE officer, the nurse administered Narcan three times without response. 


When paramedics finally arrived, Bimpong’s blood pressure was measured at a life-threatening 240/216 – which indicated a hypertensive crisis. 


Bimpong was in a hypertensive crisis when paramedics arrived at the Dakota County Jail


Body-worn camera captured a conversation between the nurse and a guard discussing how Bimpong was ignored, and the so-called well-being checks were not being done properly. 


As Bimpong was being loaded onto a stretcher, the guard tells the jail nurse what happened earlier.  




“He said, ‘he’s been that way all night, not to worry about it,’” said the guard. 


The nurse replies, “That’s not okay.”  


“Well,” the guard responded, “this person (the other guard) is not checking when he’s doing rounds. He’s just walking by and scanning.”  


Bimpong was rushed to Regina hospital in Hastings and ultimately transferred to United Hospital in St Paul, but it was too late.  




Tests showed he’d had a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage – a massive brain bleed – that had caused his brain to shift and his brain stem to squeeze out of the bottom of his skull. 


Bimpong was in a hypertensive crisis when paramedics arrived at the Dakota County Jail


He was declared brain dead and removed from life support on November 19, 2024. 


Toxicology reports, by both the hospital and later the state crime lab, confirmed no drugs were in his system. The assumption he’d overdosed on drugs was clearly wrong. 


Allegations of Systemic Failures




The lawsuit names three Eagan police officers and seven Dakota County correctional officers, along with Dakota County itself, as defendants. It claims violations of Bimpong’s constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. 


Among the allegations: 



Ignored Training: Despite advanced DRE certification, Officer Jensen allegedly skipped required evaluation steps that could have revealed a medical emergency. 


Deliberate Indifference: Both police and jail officers are accused of ignoring classic stroke symptoms - confusion, drooling, one-sided weakness, and loss of bladder control. 


False Documentation: Jail logs recorded “inmate and cell OK” while video shows Bimpong incapacitated on the floor. 


Policy Failures: The Minnesota Department of Corrections later found that jail staff were behind on mandatory CPR and first-aid training, and that well-being checks were performed improperly. 



Katie Bennett, an attorney representing Bimpong’s family, told KARE 11 that from the police officers in the field, to the correctional officers in the jail, authorities failed him at every step. “This is one of the worst jail deaths we’ve ever seen.” 


Awaiting Response




The City of Eagan and Dakota County have not yet filed formal responses to the lawsuit. Eagan’s Police Chief, Officer Jensen, and the Dakota County Sheriff all declined comment when contacted for this report. 


Bimpong, who had no criminal record, had worked for the Postal Service since 2016. He leaves behind a daughter and extended family in Ghana.

UK rejects Nigerias request to transfer Ekweremadu to Nigeria to complete prison sentence,"The United Kingdom has declined a request from the Nigerian government to allow former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu to complete his prison sentence in Nigeria.




Ekweremadu is serving time in a UK facility after he was found guilty in 2023 of plotting to harvest the kidney of a young man.


The former lawmaker received a jail term of nine years and eight months following the conviction, which stemmed from a high-profile organ-trafficking case that drew international attention.


Recently, the Federal Government, led by Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar, met with officials at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to discuss the case of Ekweremadu.


The delegation requested his deportation so he could serve his remaining sentence in Nigeria.Ads by




However, according to The Guardian UK, a source at the MoJ has confirmed the request was rejected.


The news platforms reported that the UK government was concerned that Nigeria could offer no guarantees that Ekweremadu would continue his prison sentence after being deported.


A source is reported to have said that: “The UK will not tolerate modern slavery and any offender will face the full force of UK law.”


With this development, Ekweremadu will remain in the UK to serve out the remainder of his sentence.



Meanwhile, his wife, Beatrice Ekweremadu, who was sentenced to four years and six months, with half spent in custody, was released earlier this year and has since returned to Nigeria.

Also celebrating is Stacey Nageli Angulo, who adopted Marven when he was three years old, from Haiti, in the wake of a devastating earthquake in 2010.


She helped Guerline and Rochelle come to the US three years ago, reuniting the family, as spreading gang violence triggered a fresh humanitarian crisis in the Caribbean island nation.


The two Haitian women, whose names we have changed for their safety, live and work legally in the US under a scheme called Temporary Protected Status (TPS). It provides protection for people already in the US who are from countries hit by war or natural disaster.




But TPS is due to end for 350,000 Haitians in February, as part of US President Donald Trump's sweeping changes to immigration policies.


Marven turned 16 recently, about three years after being reunited with his biological mother and sister


Rochelle, now aged 21, cheers as Marven blows out his candles, but Guerline's smile falters. In just a few months, the two women could be deported.


After the earthquake, Guerline lived in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, struggling to provide for her children. She says offering Marven for adoption ""scarred"" her, but she ""wanted a better life for him"".


Stacey, who now renovates properties after a career in the corporate world, says she felt compelled to adopt a child from Haiti in the aftermath of the disaster and raised Marven alongside her two biological children.



More recently, hearing about the violence, she began researching legal routes to the US for Rochelle and Guerline. When a humanitarian scheme opened in 2023, they applied immediately. ""Three weeks later, they were approved and on an aeroplane and here with us,"" she says.


The two Haitian women moved into a caravan on Stacey's driveway before renting an apartment locally. Guerline now works in a hotel. Rochelle has jobs at a supermarket and a nursery, and dreams of becoming a nurse.


Marven often sleeps over at their apartment and loves the Haitian food Guerline cooks. He says his life now ""feels more complete"".


But Rochelle and Guerline are terrified of returning to Haiti. The gang violence has displaced a tenth of the population, according to the UN, with kidnappings and killings rising sharply. Rape and arson are rampant.




Gangs control much of Haiti's capital - Jimmy ""Barbecue"" Cherizier (centre), seen here in 2024, leads one of them


Rochelle, now 21, says her biggest fear in Port-au-Prince was being kidnapped. ""I was at school, and I've seen young girls like me get kidnapped,"" she says. ""They asked a ransom for them, and then they didn't get them back,"" she says, adding that she believes some girls who are taken are either raped or killed.


She says she receives harrowing videos from friends and relatives in Haiti every day, including bodies being burned and gang shootouts: ""There's gun fighting all the time. You can't really go out.""


Stacey voted for President Trump in the past three presidential elections but is now horrified that Rochelle and Guerline could be sent back.


""Do we want open borders? Absolutely not. Do we want criminals deported? Absolutely,"" she says. ""But to rip families apart like ours and deport people to countries where it's absolutely unsafe… is unthinkable and unconscionable.""




Many of Haiti's 1.4 million displaced people have moved into temporary shelters in schools and other buildings


TPS for Haitians has been extended repeatedly since it was first designated in 2010.


But now the US Department for Homeland Security (DHS) says ""the environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home"".


The US government, however, advises its citizens not to travel there, because of ""kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, civil unrest"".


The US immigration service says continuing the scheme for Haitians is not in US interests, citing difficulties vetting migrants and obtaining information from Haitian law enforcement agencies, coupled with the ""serious threat posed by Haitian gangs"".




A spokesman for the DHS also told the BBC in September that TPS had been abused and exploited.


The US administration says those whose TPS ends can leave voluntarily or pursue other immigration options. Lawyers say few will qualify to stay, and many will go underground.


In Miami, another Haitian woman, who we are calling Monique, tells us she has lived in the US for more than 16 years. Her small home is lined with photos of her husband, son and daughter. She is the only one of them facing deportation - her husband is a permanent resident, her daughter is a US citizen and her son has a green card application in progress.


Monique, who now works as a bus driver, came legally under a humanitarian programme before moving on to TPS in 2010.




""Yes, it's called Temporary Protected Status,"" she says. ""But it's temporary if your home is safe. Haiti is not safe.""


She wipes away tears, convinced she will lose everything and possibly die if she returns: ""Don't send us to Haiti… just kill us.""


Stacey says she felt compelled to adopt a child in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti


Over a million people hold TPS in the US, with people from 20 countries granted the protection since 1990.


This year, the US has ended it for six countries - Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela. There have been multiple legal challenges, including one which delayed the end of TPS for Haitians.




In Florida, where 56% of voters backed Donald Trump, many Republican supporters, like Stacey, told us they wanted to see immigration law enforced but were concerned about the human cost of current policies.


She feels the Republican Party is ""completely out of touch"" with its voter base on immigration.


Local businessman Sam Romain, who is the chair of Polk County Republicans, however, is less sympathetic: ""You knew that it was temporary, you built your life on a temporary status and now… you're upset it's expiring. We knew what the rules were.""


When pressed on the situation in Haiti, he says he is not qualified to assess whether it is safe enough to return to, but believes the decision is made by qualified officials and he trusts their judgement.


Whole neighbourhoods have been attacked and destroyed in Port-au-Prince


Mr Romain says he believes in America as ""a nation of law and order"" and adds that immigration reform ""does need to happen"".


For Rochelle and Guerline, the future is filled with uncertainty.


""We were told America is the land of freedom and safety,"" says Rochelle. ""Now I don't know where we belong.""


""I love my sister very much,"" says Marven. ""I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to her.""


The three pose together for a photograph - mother, son, and daughter. But in a few months' time, two of them could be gone.

Carney says trade talks with Trump to resume when it matters,"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney says trade talks with the US will resume ""when it's appropriate"", dismissing questions about his most recent communication with President Donald Trump.




Asked when he last spoke to Trump, Carney responded: ""Who cares? It's a detail. I'll speak to him again when it matters.""


The prime minister's remarks come after trade talks were derailed last month when Trump took offence at an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan, which was aired by the province of Ontario.


Talking on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Johannesburg on Sunday, Carney suggested that talks with the president could take place ""probably in the next two weeks"".


Despite tensions, Trump is yet to impose a threatened additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports over the Ontario ad.




The ad, which featured clips of former President Ronald Reagan's 1987 radio address in which he argued that tariffs would hurt America's economy, was interpreted by Trump as an attack on his policies. Trump argues tariffs will boost American manufacturing and create jobs.


Since Trump announced tariffs against several key allies, Canada has become the only G7 nation without a trade deal with the US, despite being a major trading partner.


The US has imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods, though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.


Ottawa is seeking to lower those sector-specific tariffs.



Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticised Carney's dismissal of the urgency around US trade talks in a social media post, saying it's ""tough luck"" for those in the sectors hardest hit by the levies.


Currently, three-quarters of Canada's exports are sold to the US, making the Canadian economy particularly vulnerable.


Carney has sought to diversify the country's trade away from the US.


Over the weekend, alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Carney announced a new agreement to begin negotiations on a long-anticipated trade deal.




This follows a period of strained ties between the two countries, which were tested in 2023 by the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in Vancouver.


Carney is expected to visit India next year.


The prime minister also met President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) late last week, announcing progress on a critical minerals deal. Both sides expressed hopes of significantly increasing trade in the coming years.


Carney has faced criticism for seeking deeper business ties with countries like the UAE and India, which has been accused of interference in Canadian affairs.




The UAE has been accused of arming the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the country's civil war, which the UAE denies.


Carney said earlier on Sunday he considers India a reliable trading partner, but acknowledged ""there will be some sources of friction"".


He also said on Friday that the UAE has been an important partner, such as in efforts to deliver aid to Gaza, but the war in Sudan was part of the discussions.

Court orders seal on Celeste Rivas Hernandez case records,"Records about the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in singer D4vd's Tesla, have been barred from public release, officials said.




The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Ms Rivas Hernandez's death can be released or posted on its website.


The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers ""receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public"".


Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is ""virtually unheard of in other counties"" and ""has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system"".


""We are dedicated to serving our community with full transparency; however, the law precludes us from doing so while the court order remains in this case,"" Dr Ukpo added.




Police discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded Tesla on 8 September, after responding to reports of a foul odour at a Hollywood tow yard.


Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.


The car, registered to D4vd, had been towed from the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood five days after it had been abandoned.


D4vd, 20, whose real name David Anthony Burke, released his debut album in April and was on tour when the remains were discovered.



He has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.


A police spokesperson said the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division. No arrests have been made.

"Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds","Under the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.




She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.


Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.


Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.


That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.




The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, ""clear-headed"" recovery.


To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.


""Our aim is early discharge after surgery,"" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. ""Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.""


Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.



Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery


In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional ""blocks"" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall.


""General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,"" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. ""We've been doing this for decades.""


But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.


The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.




To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.


""The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,"" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.


""Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.""


To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. ""Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,"" notes Dr Goel. ""We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.""




The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.


So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.


""We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,"" says Dr Husain. ""The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.""


A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups


The results were striking.




Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. ""Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,"" the researchers write, ""music can still shape the brain's internal state.""


Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. ""The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,"" says Dr Wadhawan. ""You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.""


The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of ""intraoperative awareness"" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation.


If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.




""We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,"" says Dr Husain. ""It's a way of humanising the operating room.""


Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.


If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.


As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.

Obesity jab drug fails to slow Alzheimers,"Drug maker Novo Nordisk says semaglutide, the active ingredient for the weight loss jab Wegovy, does not slow Alzheimer's - despite initial hopes that it might help against dementia.




Researchers began two large trials involving more than 3,800 people after reports that the medicine was having an impact in the real world.


But the studies showed the GLP-1 drug, which is already used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity, made no difference compared to a dummy drug.


The disappointing results are due to be presented at an Alzheimer's disease conference next month and are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.


Dr Susan Kohlhaas from Alzheimer's Research UK said the results would come as a blow for people affected by Alzheimer's.




Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development at Novo Nordisk, said: ""Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success.


""While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,"" he said.


The patients who took part in the Evoke trials were aged between 55 and 85 and had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.


Dementia progression was monitored and measured through tests and interviews.



Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers, but this did not translate into delaying progression of the disease.


Dr Kohlhaas said: ""These trial results are another reminder that Alzheimer's is driven by several different biological processes. No single approach is likely to be enough.


""The field now needs to focus on understanding those processes in much greater detail and developing treatments that can be used together to tackle the disease from multiple angles.""


She added that the growing use of GLP-1 medicines through private prescriptions, largely for weight loss, offers an opportunity to gather better real-world data on their longer-term effects.




Fiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer at Alzheimer's Society, said while it was ""very disappointing"" that these eagerly awaited results were not what everyone had hoped for, ""no trial is wasted"".


""Every investigation helps us develop better drugs and design better trials in the future.""


She said there were currently more than 130 Alzheimer's drugs in clinical trials of which around 30 are in late-stage trials - the final step before they are considered by regulators.

Govt pledges to erase financial barriers to blood donation,"The government has pledged to eliminate financial obstacles that prevent Ghanaians from accessing life-saving blood transfusions, signalling a major policy push for equitable healthcare.




Dr Grace Ayensu-Danquah, the Deputy Minister of Health, conveyed this commitment during the 25th National Blood Donor Day celebration and the launch of the 2026 Annual Voluntary Blood Donation Campaign in Accra.


The National Blood Service (NBS) was held on the theme, “Give Blood, Give Hope, Together We Can Save Lives.”


The Deputy Minister, speaking on behalf of the Vice President, stated that the Ministry is “reviewing ways to ease the financial burdens on families.”


This, according to her, include exploring measures that may reduce blood processing fees over time, so that no Ghanaian is denied life-saving blood because of costs.




“This initiative is part of broader efforts to strengthen Ghana’s blood transfusion system, which includes enhancing infrastructure, equipment, and logistics in regional and district blood services to ensure more efficient collection and equitable access nationwide,” she said.


Dr. Shirley Owusu-Ofori, Chief Executive Officer(CEO), National Blood Service, highlighted the urgent need for more voluntary donors.


She noted that only 40 per cent of the current blood supply came from voluntary donors, with the majority still relying on family replacement donations.


She appealed to new and existing donors, emphasising that the annual target of 308,000 units was attainable if just one to two per cent of Ghanaians embraced blood donation as a civic responsibility.



The event also served to celebrate and honour exceptional voluntary donors and partner institutions.


In the National Best Blood Donor category, the top three positions went to Andrews Kwasi Siaw of GT. Accra with 63 donations, followed by Joseph Sunny Acquah of Cape Coast with 62 donations, and Adu Gyamfi Buadi of Kumasi with 61 donations.


The National Best Youth Blood Donor was Aaron Obeng of GT. Accra with 41 donations, while the National Best Female Blood Donor was Margaret Darko of Koforidua with 26 donations.


Among the schools, Accra Academy was named the 1st Best Second Cycle School with 491 donations, Kumasi Academy took 2nd with 448 donations, and Koforidua Secondary Technical placed 3rd with 375 donations.

Ghana launches first National Non-Communicable Diseases Research Conference,"Ghana has launched its first National Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) Research Conference, an initiative by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ghana Health Service, GIZ, and the AYA Integrated Healthcare Initiative.




The conference was held under the theme “Advancing Ghana's NCDs Research Agenda Towards Attaining Primary Healthcare Goals.”


The event brought together researchers, policymakers, development partners and health professionals to deliberate on the development of a National NCD Research Agenda. 


The aim is to generate evidence to guide policy decisions, promote multidisciplinary research, and strengthen Ghana’s healthcare system for the prevention and control of NCDs.





Speaking on behalf of the Minister for Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, the Director of External Health Cooperation at the Technical Coordinating Department of the Ministry of Health (MOH), Dr Hafez Adam Taher, stressed the government’s commitment to improving research and data quality. 




He explained that the conference offers an important opportunity to convert research into practical policy.


He said the meeting would help build stronger links between Ghanaian and international NCD researchers and “enhance national policy for data collection and knowledge generation.”


Dr Taher added that the goal is to develop a national agenda that aligns with major health sector priorities, including the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares), free Primary Health Care, and the Universal Health Coverage roadmap.





In acknowledging the support of partners, the ministry praised the commitment of local research institutions. 



He encouraged them to deepen their collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service so that research “transcends academic outcomes and becomes the backbone of policymaking.”


Delivering remarks on behalf of the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, Dr Franklin Asiedu-Bekoe, Director of Public Health, stressed the importance of research in transforming NCD care.





 He noted that strong research can lead to early detection, better clinical care, stronger health systems and improved monitoring and accountability.


He concluded that the battle against NCDs would be won through knowledge, research that informs practice, transforming systems, and saving lives.

"Adwinsa urges govt to stock libraries, buy more books from local publishers","Adwinsa Publications Limited has urged the government to prioritise the purchase of children’s books from local publishers and to consistently stock public libraries to help build a stronger reading culture among Ghanaian children.




Speaking at the Adwinsa Children’s Book and Arts Festival, organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the Ghana Library Authority to mark World Children’s Day, Kwaku Oppong-Amponsah, Chief Executive Officer of Adwinsa, said many children were eager to read but lacked access to books.


He said providing children with quality reading materials would help reduce excessive screen time.


“If parents will buy books for children, if governments will buy books for children, we should stock our libraries. When we give books to children, they will read,” he said.





Mr Oppong-Amponsah also underscored the growing role of digital technology, noting that Adwinsa had digitised many of its titles, including audiobooks. He encouraged local bookshops to expand into online sales, following the example of foreign retailers.




On challenges confronting the industry, he called for sustained government support, explaining that although Adwinsa produces storybooks in more than 11 Ghanaian languages, demand remains low. 


Many parents and schools focus largely on English textbooks, he said, adding that a stronger market for locally produced storybooks would boost literacy and create jobs across the publishing sector.


Mr John Dumelo, Deputy Minister for Food and Agriculture and Member of Parliament for Ayawaso West Wuogon, encouraged children to cultivate a reading habit, urging them to read at least one book a month to build confidence and communication skills.





Mr Alhassan Betintiche Ziblim, Executive Director of the Ghana Library Authority, said a gap existed between the production of Ghanaian children’s books and their use for leisure reading. 



He said the festival formed part of efforts to motivate children to embrace reading as an enjoyable daily activity.


He also announced ongoing reforms to the Ghana Library Authority Act, including plans for a national library, provincial memorial libraries, a library development fund, and the establishment of a regulated professional body for librarians.


World Children’s Day is observed worldwide on November 20 to commemorate the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In Ghana, the day is used to promote children's rights, education, and welfare.

Freshers at Labone SHS sit on floors for lessons  due to shortage of desks,"Some recently enrolled Form One students of Labone Senior High School in Accra sit on the floor while the rest cram on dining hall benches during lessons.




The situation has raised concerns among parents, who were asked to contribute GH¢300 for infrastructure in addition to the GH¢100 Parent Teacher Association dues but say they have seen no improvement.


When The Mirror visited the school on Wednesday, November 19, 2025, a number of classrooms had students in uncomfortable positions, especially as all the good desks were being used by the seniors (Form Three students) who were writing a mock exam.


While some leaned against walls as they wrote, others shared small desks meant for one person.


In certain classes, more than six students were seen crowded on dining hall benches, writing on their laps because there were no desks.




A teacher of Integrated Science, Mr Obed Nyarko, told The Mirror that the problem, which had persisted for years, usually began at the start of the academic year when the school admitted a large number of students under the government’s double-track system.


He explained that the existing desks were insufficient for the growing student population. 


Some desks were old, with broken legs or shaky tops, making them unsafe for use.


Mr Nyarko said the shortage affected teaching and learning because students, sometimes over 60 in a class, became easily distracted when seated on the floor or benches. 



“It is difficult to move around the classroom because of how students are seated, which makes it hard to check exercises and guide them properly. Just now, I asked them to do a ‘closed book’ test, but because they were so close, some were ‘giraffeing’ to copy and I couldn’t really do much about it,” he noted.


Some students confirmed that they sometimes had to sit on the floor during lessons.


“It is mainly us Form One fresh students. Once our seniors leave, we get desks to sit on,” said Nana Akua, a new student.


She added that the dining hall benches were particularly uncomfortable for classes. 




“My back and legs hurt after sitting on the bench for long hours because I have to bend over to write in my book. When I get tired, I kneel on the floor or squat, then put the book on the bench or floor to write,” she explained.


A General Arts Five Student, Philip Kojo, said the situation had improved slightly since they now used the dining hall benches. 


“In the early days when we first came, two weeks ago, most of us were even sitting on the floor. If you didn’t fight to get a chair, you had to sit on the floor,” he recalled.


A parent who spoke to The Mirror on condition of anonymity expressed disappointment that their children were learning in such poor conditions, even though during a PTA meeting, they were asked to contribute GH¢300 towards infrastructure development.




She said she expected the fee to go toward essential facilities such as desks and other basic items needed for teaching and learning.


“We, as parents, are even ready to offer our support towards some projects because at the end of the day these are our children and we want the best for them,” she noted. 


School authorities 


When The Mirror went to the school’s administration office, the Assistant Headmaster in charge of Administration, Mr Ishmael Ayim, said the headmistress was the best person to explain the situation but was not available.


“It is true that we have a desk and infrastructure deficit, but here we follow a hierarchical order, so it wouldn’t be my place to comment, as I don’t have the full information on the situation on the ground or the measures being taken. I’m not privy to the discussions at the higher level.




We typically only speak when our governing body, the Ghana Education Service, instructs us to do so,” he explained.


Mr Ayim added that interviews could be arranged at a later date. 


He, however, noted that as a school, they were periodically required to present a report on their state, especially when new students were enrolled.


He added that, as such, he was hopeful that through those reports, support might come.

Attorney General backs Wesley Girls SHS in Supreme Court case over alleged religious discrimination,"Attorney General and Minister for Justice Dominic Ayine has filed a formal response to a lawsuit challenging what plaintiffs describe as discriminatory religious practices at Wesley Girls’ Senior High School (SHS).




The suit, filed on 24th December 2024 by private legal practitioner Shafic Osman, invokes the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Articles 2(1)(b) and 130(1)(a) of the 1992 Constitution. The action challenges the school’s alleged restrictions on Muslim students, including claims that they are barred from wearing the hijab, fasting during Ramadan, and observing other Islamic practices, actions the plaintiffs argue violate constitutional protections for religious freedom.


In its response, the Attorney General rejects the assertion that the school’s policies are unlawful. The AG argues that Wesley Girls SHS, established and operated under the Methodist Church of Ghana, is entitled to maintain rules consistent with its Methodist heritage and doctrines.

According to the AG, the school’s faith-based identity grants it the authority to set standards of conduct and religious practice on campus, even when such rules restrict the expression of other faiths.

Katon360 leads digital learning revolution as Prsident Mahama opens Ghanasco smart block,"Katon360, a cutting-edge educational technology platform, is driving a digital transformation in Ghanaian education with the inauguration of a state-of-the-art smart classroom block at Ghana Senior High School (Ghanasco).




The two-storey digital learning facility houses 10 smart classrooms, a technical room, a lecture hall, charging and repair rooms, and other auxiliary spaces. Every student receives a tablet preloaded with academic materials, designed to last three years, supporting continuous digital learning.


The smart block, fully equipped with modern digital tools, runs on solar power to ensure uninterrupted teaching and learning.


President John Dramani Mahama commissioned the facility during Ghanasco’s 65th anniversary, describing it as a preview of Ghana’s educational future. He emphasised that the education sector is undergoing a crucial reset, anchored on innovation, technology, and future-ready instruction.





“This is already taking shape as Ghanasco benefits from a modern smart classroom, an early indication of the broader digital transformation intended to be rolled out nationwide,” the President said, noting that digital education is central to the revised national curriculum. He also urged students to use the tablets responsibly and avoid accessing inappropriate content online.




Lawrence Hornovo, Ghana Smart School Project Lead for Katon360, called the facility “a school of the future” and a major step toward digitalising Ghana’s education system.


“This is a full 21st-century learning experience. Every classroom has a smart screen, each student receives a tablet, charging cabinets are installed, and everything is solar powered. The facility is fully air-conditioned and connected to the internet. We are providing a comprehensive environment that prepares students to compete globally,” Hornovo said.





He reassured parents concerned about online access: “Every device has a tracker, and all unauthorised sites, including social media, are restricted. The system is designed purely for academic work.” He added that nationwide maintenance is in place, with technicians assigned to every district and devices covered by a one-year warranty.


Teachers report immediate benefits. Eric Addai, a Physics teacher, called the smart board “one of the best teaching experiences” of his career.



“The smart board summarises your work and allows you to upload materials in advance. Even when you’re not physically present, lessons can still be delivered. It keeps students attentive and ensures no one is left behind. Our main challenge is internet connectivity, but aside from that, the system is far more efficient than traditional methods,” he said.





Katon360 has also introduced Kanton Meet, a virtual meeting system supporting online teacher and administrative meetings beyond the school premises.


Students are equally enthusiastic. Iman Jeswinde Ismaila Abdul-Fatawu, a science student, said the platform has transformed learning:


“When I came here, I expected learning to be like JHS, but the Katon360 app has changed everything. With the tablets and access to facilitators, learning has become easier and more enjoyable. We thank the President and the government for this opportunity.”




The Ghanasco Smart Classroom Block is the second Katon360 facility in the country and the first in northern Ghana. With the government’s renewed focus on digital education, the initiative is expected to expand nationwide, providing thousands more students access to modern, technology-enhanced learning environments.

FDA seizes 98 unregistered herbal medicines in Accra,"The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has confiscated 98 unregistered herbal medicinal products during a market surveillance operation conducted between November 22 and 24, 2025, at Awoshie, and Boundary Road in Accra.




The seized items include popular products such as Amenazel Herbal Tonic, Amenazel Herbal Bitters, and Poget Herbal Mixture, all of which were being sold without the required FDA registration.


According to the Authority, the exercise forms part of ongoing nationwide efforts to protect public health by removing unapproved and potentially unsafe products from the market.


The FDA cautioned traders and manufacturers who continue to distribute unregistered products, stressing that enforcement activities will intensify in the coming weeks.


“To those selling unregistered products, we will not relent in our commitment to ensuring public health and safety, so sooner than you think we will get to you,” the Authority warned.




All seized products will undergo safe disposal in line with FDA protocols.

EOCO boss Raymond Archer on why there should be tougher bail conditions for suspects,"The Acting Executive Director of the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), Raymond Archer, has defended the ""tougher"" bail conditions being applied in recent economic crime cases, saying low sureties make it easy for suspects to evade accountability.




Speaking on Joy FM’s Newsfile programme on Saturday [November 23, 2025], the Acting Executive Director of EOCO said bail must reflect the scale of financial exposure in ongoing investigations.


“I consider bail and sureties, or I liken it to the collateral you give for a loan,” he said. “When you give collateral that is less than the loan you take, there’s no motivation to pay back.”


Mr Archer said suspects involved in economic offences cannot be treated like ordinary offenders. “Assume at every point that every criminal is at least above average. The fact that you beat the barricade compliance and everybody to steal that money tells you it's not your average job,” he stated.


He warned that lenient bail terms allow suspects in major financial cases to avoid accountability. “You can let the loans go run itself and then there’s no collateral to fall back on and you let [it] go into default. In the same way, bail is connected to a case.”




Drawing from EOCO’s work on complex financial crimes, Mr Archer said the office frequently handles cases involving vast sums. “We do a lot of investigation for the banks, for example, where somebody has stolen $90 million,” he said. “Then you give him a bail of $20 million.”


His remarks come amid public debate over the rising bail amounts seen in recent high-profile arrests.


In May 2025, the Ashanti Regional Chairman of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP), Bernard Antwi Boasiako, commonly known as “Chairman Wontumi”, was granted bail of GH¢50 million with two sureties after he was charged by EOCO for alleged financial loss to the state. Opposition MPs objected to the conditions, with the Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin calling the bond “unfair and unreasonable”.


In June, former National Food Buffer Stock Company CEO Abdul Hannan Wahab and his wife, Faiza Seidu Wuni, were granted bail of GH¢50 million and GH¢30 million, respectively. In October, the court revised the terms, raising Mr Wahab’s bail to GH¢100 million and his wife’s to GH¢50 million. Lawyers for the couple argued that the new amounts were harsh and out of proportion.



Just this November, the former Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation (BOST) Managing Director, Edwin Provencal was arrested by EOCO and initially given a GH¢60 million bail.


The court later reduced it to GH¢30 million with two sureties and a requirement to surrender his passport. EOCO has since asked the court to toughen the conditions, saying the sureties should be justified to match the state’s exposure.


Mr Archer maintained that the principle guiding EOCO’s approach is straightforward. “The exposure of the risk must be matched. If not, the Republic will have no leverage,” he said.

EU warns Ghana and Cote dIvoire to reform cocoa sector or risk losing global market share,"Ghana and neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire are facing renewed pressure from the European Union and French development partners to fast-track long-delayed reforms in the cocoa sector, amid warnings that both countries could lose competitiveness under emerging global sustainability standards.




The call came during a two-day Cocoa4Future feedback workshop in Accra, where researchers presented findings from a five-year EU- and AFD-funded project examining agroforestry systems, disease control, certification schemes, farmer livelihoods, and climate resilience across both countries.


EU officials were clear: unless agroforestry adoption accelerates, deforestation is curtailed, and labour-related risks addressed, West African cocoa could face mounting barriers under new European sustainability rules and stricter buyer requirements.


The research highlighted sector vulnerabilities and pathways for reform. Studies confirmed that many farmers prefer low- to no-shade systems, which boost short-term yields but compromise ecological resilience and long-term productivity. 


This approach, researchers warned, undermines forest recovery and leaves cocoa landscapes highly vulnerable to climate change.




On disease management, Cocoa Swollen Shoot Disease (CSSVD) remains widespread, reducing yields by up to 202 kg per hectare in severely affected farms. 


Farmer-led control methods, such as pruning infected parts or using chemicals, are largely ineffective. 


Researchers recommended intensifying rehabilitation programmes, scaling the production of CSSVD-resistant seedlings, and expanding technical training for early detection.


Certification studies showed that Fairtrade and Organic schemes significantly improve yields, incomes, and job creation, but their impact on broader food security and working conditions is uneven. 



Researchers stressed the need for stronger cooperatives, expanded extension services, affordable credit, and diversified buyer networks to improve certification outcomes.


Across all themes, the recommendations were consistent: governments must ramp up input distribution, clarify tree tenure rights, promote hybrid cocoa varieties, incentivise agroforestry adoption, and formalise support systems for farmer livelihoods, including pensions, credit, and modern farm equipment.


Development partners stressed that these evidence-based measures are critical as the global market shifts decisively toward traceable, climate-resilient, and ethically sourced cocoa—standards that Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire risk falling behind if reforms stall.

UK rejects Nigerias request to transfer Ekweremadu to Nigeria to complete prison sentence,"The United Kingdom has declined a request from the Nigerian government to allow former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu to complete his prison sentence in Nigeria.




Ekweremadu is serving time in a UK facility after he was found guilty in 2023 of plotting to harvest the kidney of a young man.


The former lawmaker received a jail term of nine years and eight months following the conviction, which stemmed from a high-profile organ-trafficking case that drew international attention.


Recently, the Federal Government, led by Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar, met with officials at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to discuss the case of Ekweremadu.


The delegation requested his deportation so he could serve his remaining sentence in Nigeria.Ads by




However, according to The Guardian UK, a source at the MoJ has confirmed the request was rejected.


The news platforms reported that the UK government was concerned that Nigeria could offer no guarantees that Ekweremadu would continue his prison sentence after being deported.


A source is reported to have said that: “The UK will not tolerate modern slavery and any offender will face the full force of UK law.”


With this development, Ekweremadu will remain in the UK to serve out the remainder of his sentence.



Meanwhile, his wife, Beatrice Ekweremadu, who was sentenced to four years and six months, with half spent in custody, was released earlier this year and has since returned to Nigeria.

KasoaWinneba highway set for June 2026 completion  Kwame Agbodza gives firm timeline,"The Kasoa–Winneba stretch of the coastal highway is expected to be completed by June 2026, Roads and Highways Minister Kwame Governs Agbodza has confirmed.




Speaking on the progress of ongoing road projects on Channel One TV on Monday, November 24, Agbodza said, “The contractor says that by June next year it will all be done.”


He added, “For the Winneba to Mankessim section, the contract allows for two years, but I am confident it will be completed before 2027.”


He noted that once these projects are finished, the route from Kasoa to Takoradi will be fully dualised, enhancing connectivity between the Greater Accra and Central Regions.


The Kasoa–Winneba–Mankessim project involves three separate contractors, while the Cape Coast to Takoradi section is handled by another.




Agbodza, who is also the Member of Parliament for Adaklu, explained that the Cape Coast to Takoradi road is a larger project that links the two regions. Within the Central Region, the Kasoa–Winneba and Winneba–Mankessim sections are progressing steadily.


“When you travel from Winneba to Mankessim, we are building a brand new road alongside the existing one to dualise it. The Winneba interchange was not initially part of the project, but it has now been included,” he added.


Addressing the traffic bottlenecks experienced this year on the Kasoa–Winneba section, the Minister acknowledged that construction planning had contributed to delays.


“We made a mistake when we started working on the main carriageway and the expansion at the same time. This led to many of the bottlenecks we saw,” he said.



Once completed, the dual carriageway will significantly improve travel along the coastal corridor, supporting trade and easing congestion for motorists.

MIIF Board blows GH11m on unapproved foreign trips as confidential audit exposes massive breach,"Confidential documents intercepted by JOYNEWS have revealed how the board and key management staff of the Minerals Income Investment Fund (MIIF) spent over GH¢11 million on foreign travels in 2024 without government approval. 




In 2020, the Ministry of Finance issued a directive that no public service officer shall travel on official business without prior approval. 


Such travel must be cleared through the Chief of Staff. However, management of MIIF disregarded this administrative guideline. 


According to the confidential report by the Ghana Audit Service, the board and key management of MIIF spent more than GH¢11 million on foreign travel in 2024 without the required approvals. 


The report indicated that the trips were undertaken without prior authorisation from the Chief of Staff, the sector minister, or the Chief Director.




The Administrative Guidelines for the Implementation of Foreign Travel Allowances, issued by the Ministry of Finance in October 2020, stipulate that public servants of the rank of Director and below must seek approval from the sector minister or, where applicable, the Chief Director. This was not followed.


Auditors noted that MIIF’s disregard for this directive led to the infraction. In response to the findings, MIIF’s Head of Human Resources stated that all travels requiring approval from the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Director were duly cleared. 


He added that, for international travel requests involving public servants above the Director grade, the HR and Administration Department acted on directives from the CEO’s secretariat, and all request memos were available for verification.


Former MIIF CEO Edward Nana Yaw Koranteng, however, maintained that the Chief of Staff at the time had been informed of all the trips. 



But the auditors noted that no correspondence between MIIF and the Office of the Chief of Staff was provided to support this claim.


Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee recently to respond to concerns about high expenditure on conferences and related activities.


Acting MIIF CEO Justina Nelson explained that the spending was necessary to give the Fund the visibility and capacity needed to operate its new office.


Another audit of MIIF’s financial statements and annual report revealed that the Fund also spent more than GH¢2 million on sitting allowances within two years. 




In 2024 alone, GH¢1.2 million was paid out, while almost GH¢1 million was paid in 2023. 


The board during the previous administration consisted of nine members. When JOYNEWS contacted those cited in the audit, they declined to comment.

I was told Daddy Lumba married Odo Broni  Family head tells court,"Abusuapanin Kofi Owusu, head of the extended family of legendary highlife musician Daddy Lumba, says he was told the late musician married Priscilla Ofori, also known as Odo Broni.




During cross-examination in court, he said Odo Broni and some family members told him about the said marriage with the musician born Charles Kwadwo Fosuh.


The alleged marriage between Priscilla Ofori, who has six children with Daddy Lumba, is being contested by Akosua Serwaa Fosuh, who is praying the court to declare her the only surviving wife and also to restrain Priscilla Ofori from identifying as the wife of the late Charles Kwadwo Fosuh.


Serwaa Fosuh's counsel, William Kusi, during cross-examination on Friday, November 21, 2025, asked Abusuapanin Owusu if he attended the marriage ceremony between Odo Broni and Daddy Lumba in 1991; he answered in the negative.


According to the family head, he met Odo Broni for the first time at the late musician’s residence upon his death in 2025.




Giving more details in court, the Abusuapanin said he got to know Daddy Lumba married Odo Broni customarily in April 2010 at Tantra Hills. 


Upon receipt of the news of Lumba’s death, he sent two of his nephews to visit the house of Charles Kwadwo Fosuh for confirmation. 


However, Priscilla Ofori declined to talk to him on the phone, at a time when she was crying throughout.


The Abusuapanin told the court it was around this time that he said in some media interviews that he did not know Priscilla Ofori to be Daddy Lumba's wife.



All this while, he had known Akosua Serwaa as the only wife of the late musician.


Testifying under oath, Abusuapanin Owusu said he exclaimed when Priscila Ofori told him she had six kids with the late musician and that she was customarily married to the late musician. She then introduced to him those who contracted the marriage and those who took the head drink.


According to him, Daddy Lumba's youngest sister, Faustina Fosuh, who is currently indisposed, confirmed the marriage between his deceased brother and Priscilla Ofori.


As customs demand, he presented Akosua Serwaa with drinks to officially inform her family of the passing of her husband, since she was also a wife.




But Abusuapaning Owusu told the court his attention was later drawn by his own family that Akosua Serwaa had returned her head drinks (tsir nsa) to the family, signalling the dissolution of the marriage.


The case continues at the Kumasi High Court.

My mo Kwame Nkrumah comment was totally misunderstood  NAPO,"The running mate to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia in the 2024 election, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, says his controversial “mo Kwame Nkrumah” remark was taken out of context and completely misunderstood. 




Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Tuesday, the former Manhyia South MP insisted that the public outrage that followed the comment did not reflect his intent.


Dr Opoku Prempeh, aka NAPO, said the statement was made in a specific political moment and should not have been interpreted as an attack on Ghana’s first President. 


“At that time, you can’t go into the evidence, so I made a statement ‘mo Kwame Nkrumah’, and I subsequently had to go to Nkroful and speak to the Chiefs there and explain the contest in which the statement was made,” he said.


He explained that political communication can be easily distorted and that leaders must take responsibility when their words create confusion. 




“Because in politics, if somebody misunderstands, misquotes, or you allow your communication to be misread or to be misunderstood, you have to own it. So I owned it, and that is why I issued the statement,” he said.


Dr. Opoku Prempeh compared his remark to football banter to underscore that he was not attacking Kwame Nkrumah. 


“Not that the context was wrong. I’m a die-hard fan of Kumasi Asante Kotoko. So if I’m teasing Olympic supporters and I said ‘mo Oly fuo no’, I’m not really insulting Olympic fans. I’m just upping Kotoko fuo because I am one of them,” he explained. 





He maintained that the Nkrumah reference had been “totally misunderstood”.



The NPP running mate acknowledged the strong reaction that followed. 


“It generated a lot of uproar. Nkrumahists got furious, and I apologise to them,” he said. But he urged critics to reflect on Nkrumah’s own writings. 


“They should go and read Kwame Nkrumah’s Last Days from Guinea and look at how he described his own Convention People’s Party (CPP). He said the CPP was dead. That’s Nkrumah’s own writing, so we don’t say these things out of lack of respect. You know me. I have friends everywhere,” he noted.


Dr. Opoku Prempeh’s comment in July 2024—stating that no president, including Kwame Nkrumah, had outperformed President Akufo-Addo—triggered widespread backlash when he was unveiled as the New Patriotic Party’s running mate. 




Critics, including the Convention People’s Party, described his remark as disrespectful. The episode reignited concerns about what many opponents have called his “arrogant” public posture.


On PM Express, however, Dr Opoku Prempeh insisted that the debate was driven by misinterpretation rather than intent. 


He stressed that the statement was political rhetoric, not an attack on Ghana’s founding leader.

Family reunited after a decade  now a Trump clampdown could tear them apart,"In a waterside house in the town of Lakeland, Florida, Marven laughs with two women he loves dearly - his sister Rochelle and their biological mother, Guerline.




The warmth between them is unmistakable as they celebrate his 16th birthday, even though they spent a decade apart. Now they fear being separated again.


Also celebrating is Stacey Nageli Angulo, who adopted Marven when he was three years old, from Haiti, in the wake of a devastating earthquake in 2010.


She helped Guerline and Rochelle come to the US three years ago, reuniting the family, as spreading gang violence triggered a fresh humanitarian crisis in the Caribbean island nation.


The two Haitian women, whose names we have changed for their safety, live and work legally in the US under a scheme called Temporary Protected Status (TPS). It provides protection for people already in the US who are from countries hit by war or natural disaster.




But TPS is due to end for 350,000 Haitians in February, as part of US President Donald Trump's sweeping changes to immigration policies.


Marven turned 16 recently, about three years after being reunited with his biological mother and sister


Rochelle, now aged 21, cheers as Marven blows out his candles, but Guerline's smile falters. In just a few months, the two women could be deported.


After the earthquake, Guerline lived in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, struggling to provide for her children. She says offering Marven for adoption ""scarred"" her, but she ""wanted a better life for him"".


Stacey, who now renovates properties after a career in the corporate world, says she felt compelled to adopt a child from Haiti in the aftermath of the disaster and raised Marven alongside her two biological children.



More recently, hearing about the violence, she began researching legal routes to the US for Rochelle and Guerline. When a humanitarian scheme opened in 2023, they applied immediately. ""Three weeks later, they were approved and on an aeroplane and here with us,"" she says.


The two Haitian women moved into a caravan on Stacey's driveway before renting an apartment locally. Guerline now works in a hotel. Rochelle has jobs at a supermarket and a nursery, and dreams of becoming a nurse.


Marven often sleeps over at their apartment and loves the Haitian food Guerline cooks. He says his life now ""feels more complete"".


But Rochelle and Guerline are terrified of returning to Haiti. The gang violence has displaced a tenth of the population, according to the UN, with kidnappings and killings rising sharply. Rape and arson are rampant.




Gangs control much of Haiti's capital - Jimmy ""Barbecue"" Cherizier (centre), seen here in 2024, leads one of them


Rochelle, now 21, says her biggest fear in Port-au-Prince was being kidnapped. ""I was at school, and I've seen young girls like me get kidnapped,"" she says. ""They asked a ransom for them, and then they didn't get them back,"" she says, adding that she believes some girls who are taken are either raped or killed.


She says she receives harrowing videos from friends and relatives in Haiti every day, including bodies being burned and gang shootouts: ""There's gun fighting all the time. You can't really go out.""


Stacey voted for President Trump in the past three presidential elections but is now horrified that Rochelle and Guerline could be sent back.


""Do we want open borders? Absolutely not. Do we want criminals deported? Absolutely,"" she says. ""But to rip families apart like ours and deport people to countries where it's absolutely unsafe… is unthinkable and unconscionable.""




Many of Haiti's 1.4 million displaced people have moved into temporary shelters in schools and other buildings


TPS for Haitians has been extended repeatedly since it was first designated in 2010.


But now the US Department for Homeland Security (DHS) says ""the environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home"".


The US government, however, advises its citizens not to travel there, because of ""kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, civil unrest"".


The US immigration service says continuing the scheme for Haitians is not in US interests, citing difficulties vetting migrants and obtaining information from Haitian law enforcement agencies, coupled with the ""serious threat posed by Haitian gangs"".




A spokesman for the DHS also told the BBC in September that TPS had been abused and exploited.


The US administration says those whose TPS ends can leave voluntarily or pursue other immigration options. Lawyers say few will qualify to stay, and many will go underground.


In Miami, another Haitian woman, who we are calling Monique, tells us she has lived in the US for more than 16 years. Her small home is lined with photos of her husband, son and daughter. She is the only one of them facing deportation - her husband is a permanent resident, her daughter is a US citizen and her son has a green card application in progress.


Monique, who now works as a bus driver, came legally under a humanitarian programme before moving on to TPS in 2010.




""Yes, it's called Temporary Protected Status,"" she says. ""But it's temporary if your home is safe. Haiti is not safe.""


She wipes away tears, convinced she will lose everything and possibly die if she returns: ""Don't send us to Haiti… just kill us.""


Stacey says she felt compelled to adopt a child in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti


Over a million people hold TPS in the US, with people from 20 countries granted the protection since 1990.


This year, the US has ended it for six countries - Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela. There have been multiple legal challenges, including one which delayed the end of TPS for Haitians.




In Florida, where 56% of voters backed Donald Trump, many Republican supporters, like Stacey, told us they wanted to see immigration law enforced but were concerned about the human cost of current policies.


She feels the Republican Party is ""completely out of touch"" with its voter base on immigration.


Local businessman Sam Romain, who is the chair of Polk County Republicans, however, is less sympathetic: ""You knew that it was temporary, you built your life on a temporary status and now… you're upset it's expiring. We knew what the rules were.""


When pressed on the situation in Haiti, he says he is not qualified to assess whether it is safe enough to return to, but believes the decision is made by qualified officials and he trusts their judgement.


Whole neighbourhoods have been attacked and destroyed in Port-au-Prince


Mr Romain says he believes in America as ""a nation of law and order"" and adds that immigration reform ""does need to happen"".


For Rochelle and Guerline, the future is filled with uncertainty.


""We were told America is the land of freedom and safety,"" says Rochelle. ""Now I don't know where we belong.""


""I love my sister very much,"" says Marven. ""I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to her.""


The three pose together for a photograph - mother, son, and daughter. But in a few months' time, two of them could be gone.

US presses Europe on rules for big tech companies,"Europe should ""reconsider"" its rules for big tech companies if it wants to see lower US tariff rates on its steel and aluminium exports, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said.




His comments come as officials from the US and European Union are meeting in Brussels to discuss the status of the trade framework that the two sides agreed on in July.


That deal set US tariff rates on European products at 15%, lower than had been threatened, in exchange for promises of European investment and changes that would allow more American agricultural products.


But the two sides remain at odds over some parts of the deal.


European officials hoped they would secure relief for their metals exports as part of the deal reached over the summer, but the US is still charging at 50% duty - and has expanded the number of products subject to the levy.




Europe is also hoping to win carve-outs from tariffs for items such as wine, cheese and pasta, similar to the rollback the Trump administration recently granted for tropical fruit and coffee.


In an update to reporters on the talks, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the US wanted to see Europe follow through on promises to lower tariffs on American goods before it would grant exemptions.


He and Mr Lutnick said the US wanted to see concessions over European rules for tech companies in exchange for changes to metals tariffs.


""They would like to have steel and aluminium as part of this package and we think it is very, very important that they understand our digital companies and they reconsider their digital regulations to be more inviting to our big companies,"" Mr Lutnick said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.



The US has long maintained that taxes on digital services - which typically charge levies on revenue from streaming or digital advertising companies above a certain size - unfairly target American firms.


US firms have also been unhappy with Europe's Digital Markets Act, which came into force last year. It was aimed at boosting competition, for example setting rules that would require a company like Apple to make its iPhones work with devices such as headphones made by other brands.


When Trump was re-elected last year, many tech firms hoped he would champion a fight over the rules and taxes, unlike the Biden administration, which was seen as leaving such battles up to the firms involved.


European officials have previously said that their digital rules were not up for negotiation. European Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said the EU had maintained that stance when the issue arose on Monday.




""This is not discriminatory. It is not aimed at American companies,"" he added.

Carney says trade talks with Trump to resume when it matters,"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney says trade talks with the US will resume ""when it's appropriate"", dismissing questions about his most recent communication with President Donald Trump.




Asked when he last spoke to Trump, Carney responded: ""Who cares? It's a detail. I'll speak to him again when it matters.""


The prime minister's remarks come after trade talks were derailed last month when Trump took offence at an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan, which was aired by the province of Ontario.


Talking on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Johannesburg on Sunday, Carney suggested that talks with the president could take place ""probably in the next two weeks"".


Despite tensions, Trump is yet to impose a threatened additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports over the Ontario ad.




The ad, which featured clips of former President Ronald Reagan's 1987 radio address in which he argued that tariffs would hurt America's economy, was interpreted by Trump as an attack on his policies. Trump argues tariffs will boost American manufacturing and create jobs.


Since Trump announced tariffs against several key allies, Canada has become the only G7 nation without a trade deal with the US, despite being a major trading partner.


The US has imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods, though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.


Ottawa is seeking to lower those sector-specific tariffs.



Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticised Carney's dismissal of the urgency around US trade talks in a social media post, saying it's ""tough luck"" for those in the sectors hardest hit by the levies.


Currently, three-quarters of Canada's exports are sold to the US, making the Canadian economy particularly vulnerable.


Carney has sought to diversify the country's trade away from the US.


Over the weekend, alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Carney announced a new agreement to begin negotiations on a long-anticipated trade deal.




This follows a period of strained ties between the two countries, which were tested in 2023 by the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in Vancouver.


Carney is expected to visit India next year.


The prime minister also met President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) late last week, announcing progress on a critical minerals deal. Both sides expressed hopes of significantly increasing trade in the coming years.


Carney has faced criticism for seeking deeper business ties with countries like the UAE and India, which has been accused of interference in Canadian affairs.




The UAE has been accused of arming the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the country's civil war, which the UAE denies.


Carney said earlier on Sunday he considers India a reliable trading partner, but acknowledged ""there will be some sources of friction"".


He also said on Friday that the UAE has been an important partner, such as in efforts to deliver aid to Gaza, but the war in Sudan was part of the discussions.

Court orders seal on Celeste Rivas Hernandez case records,"Records about the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in singer D4vd's Tesla, have been barred from public release, officials said.




The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Ms Rivas Hernandez's death can be released or posted on its website.


The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers ""receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public"".


Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is ""virtually unheard of in other counties"" and ""has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system"".


""We are dedicated to serving our community with full transparency; however, the law precludes us from doing so while the court order remains in this case,"" Dr Ukpo added.




Police discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded Tesla on 8 September, after responding to reports of a foul odour at a Hollywood tow yard.


Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.


The car, registered to D4vd, had been towed from the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood five days after it had been abandoned.


D4vd, 20, whose real name David Anthony Burke, released his debut album in April and was on tour when the remains were discovered.



He has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.


A police spokesperson said the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division. No arrests have been made.

Donald Glover reveals on stage he had a stroke last year,"American actor and rapper Donald Glover, who performs as Childish Gambino, revealed on stage during a concert that he had a stroke last year.




While performing at Tyler, the Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw festival in Los Angeles on Saturday night, Glover opened up about the reason he had to cancel his tour not long after it began in 2024.


""I had a really bad pain in my head in Louisiana, and I did the show anyway,"" Glover said on stage. ""I couldn't really see well, so when we went to Houston, I went to the hospital and the doctor was like, 'You had a stroke.'""


About a month after his New World tour began in August 2024, Glover postponed the tour, and then later cancelled the remaining dates, citing health issues.


During his performance on Saturday, Glover, 42, sat down on the stage as slow music continued in the background, as videos widely shared on social media show.




Glover - who is famous for both his music and his acting roles in shows like Community, Atlanta, and Mr and Mrs Smith - joked that he was copying fellow US actor and comedian Jamie Foxx, who suffered a stroke in 2023 that also at first presented as a bad headache.


On stage, Glover then turned more serious, telling the crowd that when he first found out he had had a stroke, he felt like he was letting everyone down. Specifically, he said, he had always promised to perform in Ireland, but he still hasn't been able to.


Glover added that doctors also found a hole in his heart, so he had to have two surgeries.


""They say everybody has two lives and the second life starts when you realise you have one,"" Glover said.



""You got one life, guys, and I gotta be honest, the life I've lived with you guys has been such a blessing,"" he told fans.


When Glover first postponed his world tour in September 2024, he wrote on social media that he had to focus on his ""physical health for a few weeks"", but still urged his fans to hang onto their tickets. 


But a month later, Glover announced he was forced to cancel the rest of the tour because of an ""ailment"" that required tests, surgery, and ""time out to heal"".


""As my wife says, which I love, 'If this life is the flavour, as soon as I'm done, give me another scoop'"", Glover told the crowd on Saturday after revealing his medical struggles.

Daughter of South Africas ex-president accuses sister of Russia recruitment plot,"One of the daughters of Jacob Zuma, South Africa's former president, has filed a criminal complaint against her sister, accusing her of recruiting men from South Africa to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war.




Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube alleged that Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, who serves as an MP, and two others tricked 17 men into fighting for Russian mercenaries.


The men were told they were travelling to Russia to train as bodyguards for Jacob Zuma's political party Mkhonto Wesizwe (MK), Zuma-Mncube's statement says.


The police say they are investigating the matter, while Zuma-Sambudla, aged 43, has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.


South Africa's government previously said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who had joined mercenary forces in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.




The men, aged from 20 to 39, were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said.


South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%. Joblessness among young people is even higher, making them especially vulnerable for recruitment, analysts say.


Zuma-Mncube said she had a ""moral obligation"" to file a police complaint against her younger sister.


Earlier this week, international financial outlet Bloomberg reported similar allegations against Zuma-Sambudla and said some men had also been recruited from neighbouring Botswana.



The allegations add to Zuma-Sambudla's legal woes - she is currently on trial over terrorism-related charges.


The MP is being prosecuted over comments she made on social media four years ago during deadly protests in South Africa, following the arrest of her father.


A week of anarchy in several parts of the country in July 2021, including looting and arson, left at least 300 people dead.


Zuma-Sambudla has been accused of fuelling this unrest but she says the charges against her are politically motivated.




Jacob Zuma was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to take part in an inquiry into allegations of corruption during his presidency that led to his sacking.


He subsequently formed the MK party and led it to third place in last year's elections.


The BBC has contacted MK and the Jacob Zuma Foundation for comment.

"Music eases surgery and speeds recovery, Indian study finds","Under the harsh lights of an operating theatre in the Indian capital, Delhi, a woman lies motionless as surgeons prepare to remove her gallbladder.




She is under general anaesthesia: unconscious, insensate and rendered completely still by a blend of drugs that induce deep sleep, block memory, blunt pain and temporarily paralyse her muscles.


Yet, amid the hum of monitors and the steady rhythm of the surgical team, a gentle stream of flute music plays through the headphones placed over her ears.


Even as the drugs silence much of her brain, its auditory pathway remains partly active. When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.


That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.




The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, ""clear-headed"" recovery.


To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.


""Our aim is early discharge after surgery,"" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. ""Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.""


Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.



Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery


In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional ""blocks"" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall.


""General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,"" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. ""We've been doing this for decades.""


But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.


The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.




To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.


""The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,"" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.


""Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.""


To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. ""Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,"" notes Dr Goel. ""We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.""




The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.


So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.


""We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,"" says Dr Husain. ""The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.""


A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups


The results were striking.




Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. ""Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,"" the researchers write, ""music can still shape the brain's internal state.""


Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. ""The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,"" says Dr Wadhawan. ""You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.""


The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of ""intraoperative awareness"" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation.


If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.




""We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,"" says Dr Husain. ""It's a way of humanising the operating room.""


Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.


If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.


As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.

Obesity jab drug fails to slow Alzheimers,"Drug maker Novo Nordisk says semaglutide, the active ingredient for the weight loss jab Wegovy, does not slow Alzheimer's - despite initial hopes that it might help against dementia.




Researchers began two large trials involving more than 3,800 people after reports that the medicine was having an impact in the real world.


But the studies showed the GLP-1 drug, which is already used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity, made no difference compared to a dummy drug.


The disappointing results are due to be presented at an Alzheimer's disease conference next month and are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.


Dr Susan Kohlhaas from Alzheimer's Research UK said the results would come as a blow for people affected by Alzheimer's.




Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development at Novo Nordisk, said: ""Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success.


""While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,"" he said.


The patients who took part in the Evoke trials were aged between 55 and 85 and had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.


Dementia progression was monitored and measured through tests and interviews.



Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers, but this did not translate into delaying progression of the disease.


Dr Kohlhaas said: ""These trial results are another reminder that Alzheimer's is driven by several different biological processes. No single approach is likely to be enough.


""The field now needs to focus on understanding those processes in much greater detail and developing treatments that can be used together to tackle the disease from multiple angles.""


She added that the growing use of GLP-1 medicines through private prescriptions, largely for weight loss, offers an opportunity to gather better real-world data on their longer-term effects.




Fiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer at Alzheimer's Society, said while it was ""very disappointing"" that these eagerly awaited results were not what everyone had hoped for, ""no trial is wasted"".


""Every investigation helps us develop better drugs and design better trials in the future.""


She said there were currently more than 130 Alzheimer's drugs in clinical trials of which around 30 are in late-stage trials - the final step before they are considered by regulators.

Climate Education Community of Practice meets in Tamale to strengthen climate education,"Ten leading climate education NGOs have come together for a Climate Education Summit at Radach Hotel in Tamale with the purpose of strengthening relationships, sharing practice, and exploring pathways for working in a stronger partnership.




This is part of a wider Climate Education Community of Practice (CECOP) — an initiative designed to strengthen complementary climate education (CCE) across schools and communities in Ghana, bringing 10 leading climate education NGOs in Ghana together on a collaborative learning journey.





Facilitated by EduSpots with funding from the Gower Street Trust, the CECOP has created a peer learning space to share strategies, consider innovative approaches and influence national climate education practice.


The collaborative and interactive Summit has included an innovative presentation on localised tree pedagogy with Dr Adom Dickson, convener of the Rights of Nature Ghana Movement, exploring how localised tree species can be nurtured and protected through creative use of local proverbs, symbolism and music in educational activities.







Participants also joined a celebratory launch of the ‘Let’s Explore Ghana Wildlife’ book, exploring endangered species with Faith Barcroft, Catherine Barr and Augustine Oti Yeboah, with over 2000 copies given out to Summit participants. Together, the group explored how this resource can be effectively used as a learning tool for the preservation of Ghana’s wildlife.





The event includes a number of activities designed to build relationships, promote partnerships, and increase fundraising capacity, with the event culminating in a climate education fundraising workshop, facilitated by Mr Kyei Yamoah.


The participating organisations include AfriKids, RoNAG, Climate Smart Training Programme, EduSpots, Orgiis, Rights & Advocacy Initiatives Network – Ghana, RAINS Ghana, SUNG Foundation, Strategic Youth Network for Development (SYND), and EcoCare Ghana.




Together, we have explored how to make climate education more student-centred, practical and locally relevant, equipping young people to become active leaders in climate action rather than passive learners.





Sarah Abotsi Masters, EduSpots’ STEM and Environmental Education Specialist, commented: “It’s been amazing to bring together so many NGOs from across Ghana, and see how their creative ideas translate into practical and purposeful projects in diverse educational contexts, ranging from school gardens and climate-smart agriculture to climate ambassador clubs.”


Calling for a stronger focus on the localisation of climate education, Dr Adom Dickson, stated that “Indigenous knowledge is time-tested, and we are calling for a synergy, so using it alongside Western botanical science.”







Wider context of CECOP


The CECOP forms part of Gower Street’s wider Complementary Climate Education Programme (CCEP), which seeks to fill critical gaps in climate education. While Ghana has integrated climate change into its national curriculum, many schools lack the practical tools, teacher training and community partnerships needed to translate policy into meaningful student-led action. Globally, the CCE approach responds to a growing recognition that education systems often prepare children for exams, not for climate resilience or leadership in solving environmental challenges.





Looking Ahead




The CECOP will document shared learning, best practices and innovative ideas from all participating organisations. These will feed into a final Legacy Report that will offer practical recommendations, seek to influence policy and inspire wider adoption of effective complementary climate education strategies in Ghana and beyond.


For further information on CECOP, please contact Sarah Abotsi-Masters at sabotsi-masters@eduspots.org (EduSpots) or Sally Vivyan at svivyan@eduspots.org (Gower Street Trust).

Ngleshie Amanfro: Armed robbery victim to be buried on December 20,"A 36-year-old taxi driver who was shot and killed by suspected armed robbers at American Farm, a suburb of Ngleshie Amanfro in the Ga South Municipality of the Greater Accra Region, will be buried on December 20, 2025 at Ngleshie Amanfro.




The date was announced by the family during a one-week observance held on Sunday, November 23, at the residence of the deceased. 





Kwasi Quist, AKA Babylon, a popular taxi driver in the community and a member of the Amanfro Taxi Drivers’ Union, was attacked and killed on Friday night, October 31, 2025, when he was going to pick up his car.


Armed robbers have been terrorising residents of Ngleshie Amanfro and its environs.


Family members of the late Kwasi Quist sat under tents in front of their modest home to receive sympathisers in tears as they recalled the tragic news of their beloved son's untimely demise.




Kwasi, affectionately known as 'Babylon' by friends and colleagues, was a serviceable and darling taxi driver in the American Farm community who had been the breadwinner of the family for many years.





His brutal murder had left a gaping hole in the lives of the bereaved family members, and the pain was still raw.


The atmosphere was sombre. Friends, relatives, and well-wishers came to support the family in observing the day as tradition demands to perform some rites to pave the way to announce the date of their fallen taxi driver, who was known for his kindness and generosity.


According to eyewitnesses, Kwasi was on his way to pick up his taxi when he was ambushed by a group of suspected armed robbers.



The attackers shot him multiple times, and he died on the spot.


 His body was discovered by passersby, who alerted the police.





The news of Kwasi's death had sent shockwaves through the community, with many expressing outrage and calling for justice.


Armed robbery had been on the rise in Ngleshie Amanfro, with several incidents reported in recent months. 




The persistent robbery attacks had prompted various landlords' and residents' associations to organise a visit to the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mr Christian Tetteh Yohuno, to discuss the security challenges facing the community. 


They demanded increased police presence and more effective measures to curb the menace.





As the family prepares to bury Kwasi on December 20, 2025, the community rallies around them, offering support and condolences.


The taxi drivers' union, of which Kwasi was a member, also promised to provide support for the funeral.




Family members, overcome with grief, wailed as they remembered their son's kind heart and generous spirit.


 ""Kwasi was a good man,"" one of the family members sobbed. ""He was the breadwinner of the family, and now he's gone. Who will take care of us?""





The memorial service was a poignant reminder of the senseless violence that had claimed Kwasi's life. As the community came together to mourn his loss, they also vowed to demand justice and an end to the armed robbery menace that had terrorized their neighborhood.





Mr Ransford Amon-Kotey, a landlord, blamed the situation on the police divisional command for their inability to provide security for the community. He said the situation is becoming worrisome.




Diana Akakpo, a trader, appealed to the IGP to dispatch police to the community to arrest the criminals.


She said the Amanfro police initially embarked on night patrols, which prevented robbery activities, but they have stopped, so the robbers have taken advantage to launch attacks again.





On his part, Mr Agyen Brefo suggested that it is now time for the community leaders to start a collaboration with the police to form a watchdog committee to protect the community against those criminals.


A source close to the Amanfro police revealed that no arrest has been made so far, but the investigation has deepened.




However, the station is currently under serious logistical constraints, which have affected its operations.





The source added that the only vehicle at their disposal is broken down.

World Childrens Day: Focus on early learning for every child  Gender Minister,"The Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection, in collaboration with Plan International Ghana, commemorated the 2025 World Children’s Day with the official launch of the national Revised Early Childhood Development Policy.




Observed under the theme, “My Day, My Right: Investing in Early Childhood, a National Priority”, the commemoration underscored the pivotal role of Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) in fostering comprehensive growth, safeguarding the well-being of children, and promoting lifelong learning for those aged 0–8 years.





Minister of Gender, Children, and Social Protection Dr Agnes Naa Momo Lartey emphasised that while Children’s Day is an important occasion to celebrate the young population, it should not be the only time they receive attention.


She stressed that children must be consistently supported, guided, and provided with access to quality education and opportunities that foster their growth and development throughout the year.





As part of the activities, the National Children’s Parliament convened, providing child representatives with a formal platform to deliberate on critical national issues.




During an interview with the Country Director for Plan International Ghana, Constant Tchona indicated that the programme is designed to reinforce a clear understanding of children’s fundamental rights, especially their rights to education, protection, health, and meaningful participation in their communities.


“The World Children's Day celebration emphasises and amplifies the rights of the child, such as the right to health, education, the right to protection and the right to voice to be able to participate and the realisation of all the rights,” he said.





Beatrice Laari Dammigu, representative for the West Mamprusi Children’s Parliament constituency, said the programme had given children the platform to openly share their dreams and the challenges they faced in their communities.


She revealed her own aspirations of becoming an engineer, a movie producer, and a seamstress, highlighting how the initiative inspires young people to envision and pursue their goals.

EC staffer behind petition against Jean Mensa and deputies removal interdicted,"Joseph Blankson Adumadzie, the Electoral Commission (EC) staff member who petitioned President John Mahama to remove Chairperson Jean Mensa and her two deputies, has revealed that he is currently on interdiction.




He filed the petition under Article 146 of the Constitution, accusing the EC leadership of misconduct. 


But Mr Adumadzie insists his personal situation is not what pushed him to act. Instead, he told Citinews his motivation came from what he believes are deepening problems in how the Commission is being managed.


According to him, he has been under interdiction for some time over issues involving Biometric Verification Devices (BVDs).


“For a while now, I don’t go to work. I have not resigned, I have not been sacked. I am on an interdiction. It’s a whole lot,” he told Citi Eyewitness News on Monday, November 24. He explained that the interdiction was linked to allegations that old BVDs were found in a refuse dump and somehow traced to him.




He firmly rejects the claims.


“It was about these BVDs. They were saying things that were not true about me, but I don’t want to go there. Yes, the old machines, but they are not with me, and it is not even true. That is the whole thing,” he insisted.


Mr Adumadzie disclosed that the Commission took him to court over the matter but failed to prove the allegations.


“They sued me and couldn’t prove anything. And for one year I won the case, and I have sued them,” he added.



He stressed that his petition to President Mahama is not an act of revenge or a reaction to his interdiction. Instead, he said it stems from concerns about the Commission’s integrity and the urgent need for accountability at the top.


In his petition, Mr Adumadzie outlines 12 grounds of alleged misconduct against the EC Chairperson and her deputies, including cronyism, abuse of office, and gross incompetence. 


He argues that their actions have undermined public confidence in the Commission and pose a threat to Ghana’s electoral credibility.


He is calling on President Mahama to refer the petition to the Chief Justice to determine whether a prima facie case exists, as required under the Constitution.

US investors explore potential of Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region,"A delegation of American investors has visited Dakhla to assess the region’s fast-growing economic landscape and explore opportunities for strategic partnerships.




The team—made up of business executives from Great Neck, New York—reviewed the region’s investment climate, infrastructure developments, and sectors considered ripe for mutually beneficial collaboration.


The mission forms part of the twinning agreement between Dakhla and Great Neck, designed to strengthen economic cooperation and promote win-win partnerships.


Lior Cohen, an American investor, said the delegation aims to “develop joint projects and identify new investment opportunities in the region,” adding that they are keen on establishing long-term relationships with key local actors.


Healthcare investor Edwin Cohen Azarkian said the strong economic momentum he observed during his first visit motivated him to return for deeper engagement. He noted that Dakhla’s favourable environment presents clear opportunities for high-growth investment.




Dakhla Communal Council President, Erragheb Hormatallah, said the delegation toured the Dakhla Atlantic Port, agricultural zones, aquaculture projects, and several industrial sites—giving them a comprehensive view of the region’s development trajectory.


Ahmed Ktir, Director of the Regional Investment Centre (CRI), said the investors were “impressed by the significant progress achieved in the region, particularly in terms of infrastructure and investments.”


A presentation was also made to the delegation highlighting Dakhla’s competitive advantages, major ongoing projects, and high-potential sectors.


During the visit, the American delegation met with the Wali of the Dakhla-Oued Eddahab region, the governor of Oued Eddahab province, the president of the Dakhla Communal Council, the CRI director, and the regional president of the General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM).



These meetings emphasised future cooperation prospects between Dakhla and Great Neck, investment opportunities across key sectors, and ongoing efforts to enhance investor support and strengthen the region’s attractiveness.

"10,000 youth to join national service in 4-year Agric programme  Eric Opoku","The Ministry of Food and Agriculture is set to enrol 10,000 youth on the National Service Scheme (NSS) under a four-year programme.




Speaking at the Government Accountability Series in Accra on Monday, November 24, Minister for Food and Agriculture Eric Opoku explained that the programme is aimed at strengthening frontline agricultural service delivery across the country.


 According to him, the initiative will also help clear the backlog of graduates from the ministry’s agricultural and veterinary colleges who have not yet been posted since 2015.


""Ten thousand youth are being enrolled on the national service scheme under a four-year programme. Each year, a portion of these youth will be retained as permanent ministry staff to augment our cultural extension delivery,” he explained.


The minister further announced plans to launch the Ghana Food Brigade before the end of December this year, as part of the ministry’s broader strategy to boost domestic agricultural productivity and service delivery.

KIC School Farm Awards 2025 honours young Agricultural leaders,"Ghana’s agricultural future was placed in the hands of its young changemakers on November 14, when Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC), in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, hosted the grand finale of the KIC School Farm Awards 2025.




Held at the KNUST Great Hall in Kumasi, the ceremony marked the culmination of the nationwide School Farm Competition (SFC), a program that transforms ordinary school plots into thriving agri-business ventures. 


This year’s awards celebrated the best-performing teams selected from over 629 schools across all 16 regions of Ghana, each demonstrating remarkable innovation, discipline, and entrepreneurial leadership in agriculture.


 Agriculture Made Real and Rewarding


The School Farm Competition was created to make agriculture relatable and exciting for young people. In his opening remarks, Benjamin Gyan-Kesse, Executive Director of KIC, emphasised the program’s impact in shifting perceptions of farming:




“The KIC School Farm Competition, which originated from the Blue Skies Foundation, began as a bold idea to make farming exciting for young people and today has grown into a nationwide program with more schools being added each year.”


He also highlighted the strong collaboration with the Ghana Education Service and the Ministry of Education, noting that the program successfully integrates practical agriculture into teaching and learning, allowing students to apply classroom concepts to real-life, hands-on experiences.


Growing Skills, Confidence, and Commercial Thinking


The competition’s judging process focused heavily on the sustainability and commercial viability of the student-managed farms, recognising that the future of agriculture depends on both scientific practice and strong business strategy.



Nana Joe Mensah, Board Chairman of KIC, affirmed KIC’s mission to build the next generation of problem-solvers and innovators:


“Through programs like the School Farm Competition, we are cultivating a generation that thinks differently, acts boldly, and builds sustainably.”


He also acknowledged the powerful partnership between Kosmos Energy, the Mastercard Foundation, and KIC, noting that their collaboration continues to create new opportunities for young people across the country.


Celebrating Excellence Across Ghana




Awards were presented to outstanding teams that excelled in innovation, sustainable farming, financial management, and agribusiness strategy.



Gbulahagu D/A Junior High School emerged as the overall top winner in the Junior High School category, receiving certificates, a plaque, a trophy, and four desktop computers.


The coveted Overall Best School Farm Award Senior High School Category (Nana Joe Mensah Award) went to St. John’s Grammar School in Accra. The school achieved exceptional results through organic crop production, including tomato cultivation on a 2,500 m² plot, supported by a strong market linkage strategy. They received five desktop computers, a trophy, certificates, and a plaque.



 A Growing Movement for National Impact


The 2025 School Farm Awards reaffirm KIC’s commitment to nurturing a generation that views agriculture not as a last resort, but as a promising, innovative, and profitable career path. 


The event’s strong attendance and nationwide representation signal the strategic importance of youth-led agriculture in ensuring Ghana’s long-term food security and economic growth.




KIC’s School Farm Competition continues to expand its footprint and inspire thousands of young people cultivating not only crops, but also confidence, leadership, and the entrepreneurial spirit needed to drive the future of agriculture in Ghana.

JFKs granddaughter raises awareness of rare leukaemia with poignant essay,"Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, moved many Americans over the weekend with her emotional essay about being diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after giving birth to her second child.




In the New Yorker, the 35-year-old stunned readers, writing that she was battling acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive blood cancer, and had less than a year to live.


Doctors and researchers say the essay helped raise awareness about the deadly illness and the critical need for more funding and research to tackle treatment-resistant cancers.


""It's such an obviously moving and courageous essay,"" said Vijay Sankaran, a physician with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. ""She comes from a very prominent family, and yet anybody can be affected by cancer, even people who are young, who are seemingly healthy.""


In the essay, titled A Battle With My Blood, Schlossberg said she was diagnosed after doctors noticed an abnormally high white-blood cell count after giving birth to her daughter in May 2024.




The daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, she said she was shocked by the diagnosis, as she considered herself ""one of the healthiest people I knew"".


One of the dangers of acute myeloid leukaemias is that they can emerge suddenly, going from being undetactable to affecting hundreds of cells in a matter of days, said Dr Sankaran.


The cancer - affecting both the bone marrow and blood - is rare, sickening four in 100,000 adults each year.


Schlossberg's subtype of leukaemia - a chromosomal abnormality formerly called Inversion 3 - is even rarer, affecting only 1% to 2% of people with acute myeloid leukaemia.



The rare genetic mutation makes Schlossberg's cancer even more dangerous. It is one of the few subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia for which there are few effective therapies - meaning remissions or cures are the minority"", said Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukaemia at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre.


The most common treatments involve bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy and clinical trials.


Schlossberg tried them all.


She described in her essay the transplant doctors drained from her sister's arms and chemotherapy that made her once ""great hair"" fall out.




She joined a clinical trial for CAR-T-cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy for certain blood cancers, in which she said scientists ""engineered my sister's T-cells, directing them to attack my cancer cells"".


Though the therapy has been revolutionary for other types of leukaemia, it is less so for acute myeloid leukaemia, Dr Sankaran said.


In the last clinical trial, her doctor told Schlossberg that he could ""keep me alive for a year, maybe"".


She also discussed battling cancer while watching her cousin, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, make massive cuts to research funding, including for cancers. She and other family members are ardent critics of Kennedy since his unsuccessful presidential campaign and nomination for the health role.




""As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,"" Schlossberg wrote.


Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, announced in August that he was pulling the funding over claims that ""mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits"" for certain respiratory viruses. He also revoked funding for hundreds of research grants through the National Institutes of Health (NIH).


Even though cuts to mRNA funding were only for respiratory viruses, they have had a chilling effect in the entire mRNA research community, said Jeff Coller, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University focused on RNA therapeutics.


""We've seen that researchers are, quite frankly, afraid to put together proposals for clinical trials that would be using mRNAs. And we call these cancer vaccines,"" he said.




The NIH was once a global leader in funding for biomedical research, but that has changed this year, Dr Sankaran said.


""That's been limiting, because you could just imagine you need to take more shots on goal to actually have research that will successfully lead to therapies,"" he said.


Schlossberg's battle - while having access to the best care as a member of a prominent American family - highlights the need for more funding to develop better screening tools and treatments for all patients, physicians said.


""[Schlossberg] continues to have a poor prognosis with even the best available tools that we have, and so I think it just really emphasises our need to do better for many of our patients,"" Dr Sankaran said.

Govt pledges to erase financial barriers to blood donation,"The government has pledged to eliminate financial obstacles that prevent Ghanaians from accessing life-saving blood transfusions, signalling a major policy push for equitable healthcare.




Dr Grace Ayensu-Danquah, the Deputy Minister of Health, conveyed this commitment during the 25th National Blood Donor Day celebration and the launch of the 2026 Annual Voluntary Blood Donation Campaign in Accra.


The National Blood Service (NBS) was held on the theme, “Give Blood, Give Hope, Together We Can Save Lives.”


The Deputy Minister, speaking on behalf of the Vice President, stated that the Ministry is “reviewing ways to ease the financial burdens on families.”


This, according to her, include exploring measures that may reduce blood processing fees over time, so that no Ghanaian is denied life-saving blood because of costs.




“This initiative is part of broader efforts to strengthen Ghana’s blood transfusion system, which includes enhancing infrastructure, equipment, and logistics in regional and district blood services to ensure more efficient collection and equitable access nationwide,” she said.


Dr. Shirley Owusu-Ofori, Chief Executive Officer(CEO), National Blood Service, highlighted the urgent need for more voluntary donors.


She noted that only 40 per cent of the current blood supply came from voluntary donors, with the majority still relying on family replacement donations.


She appealed to new and existing donors, emphasising that the annual target of 308,000 units was attainable if just one to two per cent of Ghanaians embraced blood donation as a civic responsibility.



The event also served to celebrate and honour exceptional voluntary donors and partner institutions.


In the National Best Blood Donor category, the top three positions went to Andrews Kwasi Siaw of GT. Accra with 63 donations, followed by Joseph Sunny Acquah of Cape Coast with 62 donations, and Adu Gyamfi Buadi of Kumasi with 61 donations.


The National Best Youth Blood Donor was Aaron Obeng of GT. Accra with 41 donations, while the National Best Female Blood Donor was Margaret Darko of Koforidua with 26 donations.


Among the schools, Accra Academy was named the 1st Best Second Cycle School with 491 donations, Kumasi Academy took 2nd with 448 donations, and Koforidua Secondary Technical placed 3rd with 375 donations.

Food inflation has dropped sharply to 9.5% in October 2025  Agric Minister,"The Minister for Food and Agriculture, Eric Opoku, says Ghana’s food inflation has dropped dramatically to 9.5 per cent as of October 2025, marking one of the most significant declines in recent years.




Speaking at the Government Accountability Series in Accra on Monday, November 24, Mr Opoku attributed the improvement to decisive policy interventions, stabilisation measures, and reforms within the food production and supply chain.


He recounted the difficult economic environment the government inherited, noting that food prices had risen steeply over the past three years.


“Indeed, food prices in Ghana have been on a relentless upward trajectory. Between 2022 and early 2025, the cost of basic food commodities more than doubled in several urban markets,” he said.


Mr. Opoku explained that the country experienced a historic surge in food inflation, which peaked at 61 per cent in January 2023 under the previous administration. 




Although there were minor declines afterwards, food inflation remained “dangerously high”, undermining household purchasing power and increasing the general cost of living.


He added that when the NDC government assumed office in January 2025, food inflation stood at 28.3 per cent, illustrating the fragile macroeconomic environment at the time.


“Today, due to decisive leadership, prudent interventions and efforts to stabilise the food system, food inflation has dropped significantly to 9.5 per cent as of October 2025, providing much-needed relief to households and industries alike,” he noted.


The minister described the turnaround as clear evidence of the impact of the government’s push to reset the agricultural economy, saying the gains reflect the importance of building strong fundamentals for sustainable food security.



Mr. Opoku assured that the ministry will continue to implement strategic reforms aimed at strengthening local production, improving market efficiency, and ensuring continued price stability across the country.

Police nab alleged Nigerian fugitive accused of murdering woman and daughter,"A 26-year-old Nigerian, who allegedly murdered a woman and her daughter in Nigeria and fled to Ghana, has been arrested at Akwatia by the Eastern South Regional Police Command. 




Victor Benjamin Fejeminrokum was arrested after police in Ghana intercepted a viral video alleging that he had abducted and murdered a lady who worked with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and her daughter at Abeokuta in Ogun State, Nigeria. 


A statement issued and signed by Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) David Fianko-Okyere, Public Relations Officer, Eastern South Region, said the suspect was wanted by the Nigerian Police but fled to Ghana and hid among friends at Akyem Wenchi, a suburb of Akwatia in the Eastern Region. 


“On receipt of the information that the suspect was hiding in his friend’s house at Akwatia, the Eastern South Regional Police Command quickly deployed an intelligence-led operation to arrest the suspect at his hideout at Akyem Wenchi,” the statement said. 


“The suspect is currently in police custody, and arrangements are underway to hand him over to the Nigerian authorities,” it said. 




“We entreat the public to report any suspicious movement of any person or group of persons in their communities to help prevent crime.” 


The statement assured the public of sustained operations to deal with criminal activities within the jurisdiction.

ASEC urges govt to act to reverse oil production decline and stabilise revenues,"The Africa Sustainable Energy Centre (ASEC) has warned that Ghana’s rapidly declining crude oil production poses an immediate fiscal and economic threat, calling for urgent and strategic interventions to safeguard the country’s petroleum revenues and national energy security.




In a statement, ASEC said Ghana experienced a 56 per cent decline in petroleum revenue in the first half of 2025, a shock that could severely disrupt essential public expenditure and undermine macroeconomic stability if left unaddressed.


The Centre stressed that reversing the decline in oil production must be treated as a national priority.


ASEC outlined a series of recommendations aimed at halting the downward trend and restoring confidence in Ghana’s upstream petroleum sector.


According to the statement, the West Cape Three Points Block 2 (WCTP2) remains the most realistic short-term solution to boost output.




Estimated at 1.5 billion barrels of recoverable resources, WCTP2 is described as the only asset capable of producing significant incremental barrels between 2028 and 2032.


ASEC urged the government to expedite appraisal and development activities on the block to unlock badly-needed revenues.


The Centre also dismissed suggestions that Ghana’s Voltaian Basin could serve as a near-term economic lifeline. It noted that commercial production from the Basin is not feasible before 2033–2036, and must be treated as a long-term strategic asset, not a solution to current fiscal challenges.


ASEC further raised serious concerns about the conduct of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), stating that the corporation has failed to remit $488.8 million in Explorco lifting proceeds to the Petroleum Holding Fund.



The statement described the situation as a breach of statutory obligations, especially given GNPC’s central role in reversing production decline. It also cited GH¢4.9 million spent on a golf clubhouse as evidence of weak financial discipline.


“These matters must be formally reviewed,” ASEC stated, arguing that the government should ensure full accountability before handing over any new exploration or production responsibilities to GNPC subsidiaries.


ASEC acknowledged recent announcements of $3.5 billion in new upstream sector investments, but cautioned that such spending is largely defensive, intended to slow the natural decline in existing mature fields, and will not trigger a major production boom.


The group insisted that the real growth opportunity lies in developing new high-impact assets such as WCTP2.




The Centre recommended that GNPC’s Explorco subsidiary lead operations on WCTP2, but warned the state against forcibly reclaiming Springfield E&P’s stake. Instead, it advised government to acquire Springfield’s interest to prevent costly international arbitration and avoid delays to production timelines.


Transparency, ASEC stressed, must be central to any acquisition. It urged authorities to ensure that all technical data required for assessment of WCTP2 is accessible, and that the independent technical and transactional advisory process remains free from “commercial or political bias” to protect Ghana’s national interests.


“The decline in crude oil production is no longer a distant concern. It is a present fiscal and economic threat,” the Centre stated, calling for decisive action, stronger governance controls, and reforms that prioritise long-term energy security.


ASEC concluded that Ghana stands at a crossroads and must immediately commit to developing WCTP2, restoring accountability within the national oil sector, and building the Voltaian Basin as a sustainable future pillar of petroleum growth.

Trump says he will visit China in April after call with Xi,"President Donald Trump has said he agreed to visit Beijing in April and invited Chinese President Xi Jinping for a state visit later next year, following a phone call between the two leaders.




Trump and Xi - who met nearly a month ago in South Korea - discussed a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to the president and China's foreign ministry.


""Our relationship with China is extremely strong!"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.


China's state new agency released a statement that said both countries should ""keep up the momentum, keep moving forward in the right direction on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit"".


The leaders met in Busan, South Korea in October, after which they agreed to a truce on tariffs. The US decided to cut a 20% tariff in half aimed at decreasing the flow of fentanyl.




Tariffs remain on Chinese goods and average just below 50%.


""Since then, the China-US relationship has generally maintained a steady and positive trajectory, and this is welcomed by the two countries and the broader international community,"" the Chinese statement said.



Xi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer game


Trade, tariffs and TikTok: Why it matters that Trump and Xi are talking again



The US then pulled back a threat of 100% additional tariffs on Chinese goods, while China delayed its plan to introduce its latest round of rare earth export controls.


White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Monday call with Xi - which lasted about an hour - was focused on trade.



""We are pleased with what we've seen from from the Chinese, and they feel the same way,"" she said.


In addition to discussing trade, Xi and Trump broached the topics of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan.


Xi told Trump that Taiwan's ""return to China"" is essential for China's vision for the ""post-war international order"".


China has been marred in a diplomatic battle with Japan, a US ally, over the longstanding ""strategic ambiguity"" on the sovereignty of self-governed Taiwan.




Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said any Chinese attack on Taiwan could force a Japanese military response.


Trump, however, did not mention Taiwan in his Truth Social post about the call.


US Ambassador to Japan, George Glass, previously said the US backs Tokyo in the wake of China's ""coercion"".

MoFA to supply only local seeds from 2026  Eric Opoku,"The Minister for Food and Agriculture, Eric Opoku, has announced a major policy shift that will see Ghana rely exclusively on locally produced seeds for its agricultural programmes starting in 2026.




Speaking at the Government Accountability Series in Accra on Monday, November 24, the minister said the decision follows years of disruption caused by delays in the arrival of imported seeds, which often reached farmers long after the planting season had passed.


“To tackle this, the government has prioritised local seed production as a strategic imperative for food security... From 2026, MoFA will only supply locally sourced seeds to the Ghanaian farmers,” he announced.


The minister said the change is expected to boost the local seed industry, improve seed availability, and ensure timely delivery to farmers—all of which are critical for improved yields and national food security.


Mr. Opoku stressed that achieving seed sovereignty is essential for the country’s long-term agricultural stability. “Without seed sovereignty, there can be no food security,” he noted.




He highlighted the capacity and potential of Ghana’s agricultural research institutions, saying they possess the expertise required for seed research, development and testing. The ministry, he added, is fully prepared to work with them to strengthen domestic seed production systems.

Agric Minister outlines key developments under Feed Ghana Programme in past nine months,"Minister for Food and Agriculture, Eric Opoku, has announced significant progress under the government’s Feed Ghana Programme, introduced by the Mahama administration to transform agriculture, boost food security, create jobs and reduce the country’s dependence on food imports.




Speaking at the Government Accountability Series in Accra on Monday, November 24, the Minister said several key interventions have been rolled out within the past nine months to modernise Ghana’s agricultural sector and increase productivity.


Mr Opoku stated that the programme has already delivered 10 new small dams and the rehabilitation of eight existing irrigation dams.


In addition, 250 solar-powered boreholes have been provided for farming communities and second-cycle schools across the five northern regions, as well as the Bono and Ahafo regions.


He said rehabilitation works are also ongoing on several major irrigation schemes. These include the 850-hectare Vea Irrigation Scheme in the Bolgatanga and Bongo districts of the Upper East Region, the 880-hectare Weta Irrigation Scheme in the Ketu North Municipality of the Volta Region, and the 100-hectare Tanoso Irrigation Scheme in the Techiman Municipality of the Bono East Region.




Similar upgrades are underway on the 930-hectare Kpong Irrigation Scheme in the Shai Osudoku and Lower Manya districts, the 200-hectare Ashaiman Irrigation Scheme, and the 245-hectare Aveyime Irrigation Scheme in the Volta Region.


Mr Opoku added that 25 out of 35 planned solar-powered boreholes have been completed, with the remaining 10 expected to be finished in the first quarter of 2026. A further 44 solar-powered boreholes are being developed for selected districts in northern Ghana.


The Minister also announced that processes have begun for the development of new inland valleys to expand rice production.


These include the 175-hectare Anunuso Inland Valley in the Anunuso, Brofoyedu, Nkwawkwanua, and Awaham communities; the 150-hectare Atonsu Inland Valley in the Atonsu and Abramaso communities; and the 647-hectare Kawampe Inland Valley serving nine communities in the Bono East Region.



Other sites include the 114-hectare Odaho and Odamu inland valleys in Yaw Nkrumah and Donuaso, and the 114-hectare Waamu-Kumi Inland Valley in the Ashanti Region.


Mr Opoku further revealed that the Government of Ghana and the Korea Rural Cooperation (KRC) are constructing irrigation infrastructure on 100 hectares of land to support rice seed production.


He assured the public that the Mahama administration is committed to expanding irrigation systems to ensure all-year-round farming.


He announced that 10,000 tonnes of high-quality rice seed will be produced by 2027, saying, “Ghana will be well on its way to rice seed independence.”




Highlighting progress in stabilising food prices, the Minister recalled that food inflation reached an unprecedented 61 per cent in January 2023, dropped to 28.3 per cent in January 2025, and had further declined to 9.5 per cent by October 2025.


Mr Opoku said these outcomes demonstrate the gains being made through the Feed Ghana Programme and other agricultural policies aimed at enhancing food production and strengthening Ghana’s agricultural foundation.

Ghana secures 154m Italian investment to expand large-scale commercial agriculture,"The Minister for Food and Agriculture, Eric Opoku, has announced a €154 million investment from the Government of Italy, in partnership with BF International, to support the transformation of large-scale commercial agriculture in Ghana. 




He made the announcement at the Government Accountability Series in Accra on Monday, November 24.


According to him, the project will include the development of a 10,000-hectare irrigated model farm for the all-year-round cultivation of rice, maize, soya and tomatoes.


As part of the initiative, CIHEAM Bari, an agency of the Italian Government, will collaborate with the West Africa Centre for Crop Improvement (WACCI) at the University of Ghana to establish a national seed bank.


CIHEAM Bari will also partner with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to roll out a nationwide soil testing and land-suitability programme to improve crop performance.




Mr Opoku explained that these efforts fall under the Mahama administration’s Feed Ghana Programme, introduced to modernise agriculture, strengthen food security, support job creation, reduce import dependence and increase domestic production and exports.


He outlined a series of developments achieved over the past nine months.


He noted that 10 new small dams have been constructed while eight existing irrigation dams have been rehabilitated. In addition, 250 solar-powered boreholes have been installed for farming communities and second-cycle schools across the five regions of the north, Bono and Ahafo.


The Agric Minister noted that major irrigation schemes are also undergoing rehabilitation.



These include the Vea Irrigation Scheme in the Bolgatanga and Bongo districts of the Upper East Region, covering 850 hectares; the Weta Irrigation Scheme in the Ketu North Municipality of the Volta Region, covering 880 hectares; and the Tanoso Irrigation Scheme in the Techiman Municipality of the Bono East Region, covering 100 hectares.


The Kpong Irrigation Scheme in the Shai Osudoku and Lower Manya districts of the Greater Accra and Eastern regions, which spans 930 hectares, is also being upgraded, together with the 200-hectare Ashaiman Irrigation Scheme in Greater Accra and the 245-hectare Aveyime Irrigation Scheme in the Volta Region.


He added that 25 solar-powered boreholes have already been completed, and the remaining 10 will be ready in the first quarter of 2026, alongside 44 additional solar boreholes for selected northern districts.


The Minister said processes have begun for the development of several inland valleys for rice production.




These include the 175-hectare Anunuso Inland Valley in the Anunuso, Brofoyedu, Nkwawkwanua and Awaham communities of the Ashanti Region; the 150-hectare Atonsu Inland Valley in the Atonsu and Abramaso communities, also in the Ashanti Region; and the 647-hectare Kawampe Inland Valley serving the Kwawampe, Tanfulto, Kaaka, Tadefufuo, Tahiru Akura, Chiranda, Atta Akura and Abrewanko communities in the Bono East Region.


Additional developments include the Odaho and Odamu Inland Valleys in the Yaw Nkrumah and Donuaso communities of the Ashanti Region, covering 114 hectares, along with the Waamu-Kumi Inland Valley in Waamu Kumi and Offinho, also in the Ashanti Region, which covers 114 hectares.


Mr Opoku revealed further that the Government of Ghana and the Korea Rural Cooperation (KRC) are constructing irrigation infrastructure on 100 hectares of land to support rice seed production.


He assured the public that the Mahama administration is committed to expanding irrigation systems nationwide to promote all-year-round farming.




He said the government expects 10,000 tonnes of high-quality rice seed to be produced by 2027, adding, “Ghana will be well on its way to rice seed independence.”


He also highlighted improvements in food inflation, recalling that it stood at an unprecedented 61 per cent in January 2023, dropped to 28.3 per cent in January 2025, and declined further to 9.5 per cent by October 2025.


According to him, this demonstrates the positive impact of the reforms and strategic interventions being rolled out under the Feed Ghana Programme.

OSP deceived public over Ofori-Attas red notice redaction  Lawyers allege,"Law firm Minkah-Premo, Osei-Bonsu, Bruce-Cathline & Partners, acting on behalf of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, has accused the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) of misleading the public regarding the removal of Mr Ofori-Atta’s image and details from INTERPOL’s website.




In a letter dated November 24, 2025, the lawyers said the OSP’s November 19 press release falsely suggested that the “redaction” of Mr Ofori-Atta’s red notice was a routine process pending a final decision by INTERPOL’s Commission for the Control of Files (CCF).


According to the lawyers, there was no redaction, but rather a complete blocking of the red notice by INTERPOL after a stringent legal assessment established that the notice violated the organisation’s rules.


The law firm explained that on ""June 11, 2025, it submitted a formal application to the CCF requesting the removal of the red notice, arguing that it breached Articles 2 and 3 of INTERPOL’s constitution, including Mr Ofori-Atta’s right to health and protection against politically motivated prosecution.""


Following the submission of further evidence between September 8 and November 3, the firm said the CCF concluded that the required conditions for publication were not met.




They added that on November 17, 2025, INTERPOL took down the red notice from its website, and on November 19, the CCF notified the lawyers that it had decided to suspend access to the red notice pending a full legality review.


The firm emphasised that such a suspension is rare and occurs only when there are “strong issues of compliance” with INTERPOL’s legal framework.


OSP Withheld Critical Facts – Lawyers


The lawyers criticised the OSP for omitting these details in its public communication, accusing the office of concealing key facts and creating the impression that the removal was part of a standard confidentiality process.



“It is our client's instruction that such a statement from you might have been born out of your lack of experience in putting people on Red Notice or mere malicious desire to expose our client to harm,” the letter stated.


Political Persecution Concerns


The lawyers further argued that the OSP’s actions, combined with threats to bring Mr Ofori-Atta to Ghana while he was undergoing surgery in the United States, amounted to political persecution and disregard for his human rights.


They urged the OSP to correct what they described as “manifestly erroneous” statements, warning that the comments undermine the integrity of international legal processes.

"Ghana to launch Food Brigade, recruit 10,000 youth into agriculture under new national service programme","Ghana is set to launch the Ghana Food Brigade before the end of December as part of a major push to improve agricultural productivity and food security, the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Eric Opoku, has announced.




The government will also recruit 10,000 young people into a special four-year national service programme dedicated to agriculture.


Each year, a portion of these recruits will be absorbed permanently into the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to strengthen agricultural extension services and provide ongoing support to farmers across the country.


Speaking at the Government Accountability Series on Monday, November 24, Mr Opoku explained that the initiative is designed to build a skilled agricultural workforce and better equip the sector for long-term stability.


“It is our hope that the Ghana Food Brigade will be launched before the end of December this year.”




He added that the youth recruitment plan is central to improving extension delivery nationwide.


“In addition 10,000 youth are being enrolled on the national service scheme under a four-year programme.


“Each year, a portion of this youth will be retained as permanent ministry staff to augment agricultural extension delivery.”


The Ghana Food Brigade is expected to serve as a key vehicle for promoting national food security, modernising agricultural practices, and ensuring that farmers receive consistent technical support.



The initiatives form part of the government’s broader strategy to modernise agriculture, improve productivity, and build a sustainable workforce committed to supporting Ghana’s long-term agricultural development.

Swallowed by the Sea: The sad reality of Kporkporgbor and Fuveme,"The waves arrive without mercy. They slam into what used to be bedrooms, break through kitchens that once smelled of smoked fish, and swallow the land where children once ran barefoot to school. 




In Kporkporgbor and what remains of Fuveme, the ocean is not a distant horizon, it is now the neighbour that knocks down walls in the dead of night.


Once-thriving fishing villages along Ghana’s coast are becoming ghost towns. Agavedzi, Fuveme, and Salakope, Amutinu —communities that shaped the cultural spine of the Anloga and Ketu coastline, are now graveyards of memories, with the sea devouring homes, churches, cemeteries, and ancestral lands.


For 78-year-old Daavi Afi, the erasure happened in a single night. She still trembles as she recalls watching the ocean roar into her six-bedroom compound, lifting her life of 50 years and dragging it away like driftwood.





Today, she sleeps on a thin mat in her married daughter’s small hall in Dzita.




“When the sea took my house, it took my history too.”


For 12-year-old Dziedzorm, the loss is equally heartbreaking. His school—his only place of hope, collapsed into the ocean.


“I don’t go to school again,” he told JoyNews. The sea ate it.”


These are not isolated tragedies. They are the human face of a worsening climate crisis: rising sea levels, intense tidal waves, sand mining, mangrove loss, and sediment disruption from past sea defense projects have turned the coastline into a battleground where the people are losing.



Over 200 houses in Fuveme are gone. The shoreline has moved more than 100 meters inland in less than a decade. Entire families are now climate refugees, displaced into neighbouring communities with no compensation, no land, and little hope.





The sea has also salinized freshwater sources, leaving mothers walking long distances for clean water. Fishermen must now travel to other towns to launch their boats, losing precious income.


“We can’t keep burying our history,” an assembly member said. “By the time help arrives, the town is already gone.”


Beyond the wreckage is something more painful: the loss of identity. Homes built through generations are collapsing. Cemeteries have been washed away. Social networks are breaking apart as families scatter.




Every wave is a reminder of what has been taken, and what may be lost next.





Residents say the time for promises has passed. They want comprehensive coastal protection, fair compensation, sustainable relocation plans, mangrove restoration and dredging, and psychosocial support for displaced families.


If these interventions do not come quickly, more towns will disappear forever.

"No way home: Women and children stranded in Keta, Anloga and Ketu floods","The water rose silently at first, creeping under doors and soaking beds. Then it surged drowning homes, schools, and farmlands from Mepe to Keta, from Anloga to Ketu South. 




Today, for thousands of women and children, the floodwaters have taken away not just their houses, but their sense of safety.


The flooding was fuelled by a combination of heavy rains and the spillage of the Akosombo Dam between September 15 and October 30, 2023. The Volta River Authority (VRA) was forced to release water to protect the integrity of the dam, triggering a humanitarian disaster that displaced nearly 38,000 people.


In a cramped classroom in Agbledomi, Ablavi, a mother of four, shares the space with 27 other displaced persons. Her newborn survived a nighttime flood surge only because she clutched him tightly above the water.


“I screamed until my voice finished,” she told JoyNews. “Every night, I fear it will happen again.”







In Kedzi, 17-year-old Edem lives with another type of pain. His WASSCE exams were interrupted when water burst into his classroom.


“I haven’t recovered,” he admits. “I don’t know if I will write again.”


The shelters are overcrowded, wet, and unsafe. Mothers cook on small fires under leaking roofs. Children sleep on cold floors. Privacy is a luxury no one here can afford.


As floodwaters stagnate, a new threat is rising: Malaria cases are increasing, Diarrhoeal diseases are spreading, Cholera fears loom, latrines have collapsed, and open defecation is widespread.



Girls are missing school—some permanently. Mothers trade their last bowls of gari for candles and sachets of clean water.


While NADMO, humanitarian organizations, and local authorities are providing support, the scale of the crisis exposes glaring gaps in disaster preparedness.


“How long will we live like this?” a teacher asked. “How do we rebuild when we have lost everything?”


Farms worth millions of cedis are gone. Businesses destroyed. Boats and nets washed away. The economic scars may last for years.







Experts insist that what is unfolding is more than flooding, it is a humanitarian emergency requiring coordinated action.


Immediate needs: Emergency food and water, Mobile health services, Sanitary materials, Temporary shelter.


Long-term needs: Proper drainage systems, Floodplain zoning, Women-centred emergency shelters.


Women and children remain the most vulnerable, and the most forgotten. Their recovery must be at the centre of every intervention.

Agric Minister raises alarm over soaring import bill and historic food inflation,"The Minister for Food and Agriculture (MoFA), Eric Opoku, has warned that Ghana’s food economy had reached a critical state before the National Democratic Congress (NDC) assumed office in January 2025, noting that the country’s dependency on imported staples had become “alarming”.




Speaking at the Government’s Accountability Series at the Jubilee House on Monday, November 24, Mr Opoku said the urgency of the government’s agricultural transformation agenda “cannot be overemphasised”, given the severe structural weaknesses inherited earlier in the year.


According to the minister, as of 7 January 2025, Ghana was spending about $3 billion annually on the importation of basic food items such as rice, poultry, vegetable oils, sugar and processed products – goods he stressed “could and should be produced locally”.


This, he said, had drained the nation’s foreign exchange reserves, undermined domestic food self-sufficiency and left the economy exposed to external shocks.


Mr Opoku further highlighted the rapid escalation of food prices in recent years, noting that between 2022 and 2025 the cost of several staple commodities had more than doubled across major urban markets.




He described the most striking sign of the crisis as the “historic and unprecedented” food inflation rate of 61 per cent recorded in January 2023 under the previous administration. 


Although inflation eased slightly thereafter, he said food prices “remained dangerously high”, significantly eroding purchasing power and pushing up the cost of living for millions of Ghanaians.


The Minister emphasised that the government’s current reforms aim to reverse these trends by boosting local production, strengthening food security and reducing the nation’s reliance on volatile international markets.

Migrant youth make U-turn as stakeholders develop intervention for dry spell,"In the Savannah Region of Ghana, migration has increasingly become a household mechanism in adapting to climate change. 




Dr. Shelta Gatsey, Lead of the Strategic Initiatives for African Governance, explains, ""For many young people in regions affected by climate variability, migration is often temporal or seasonal. It allows them to earn money, supplement their livelihoods when their harvests fail, and, in some cases, use remittances as a foundation to build a more secure future.""


In a remarkable turn of events, migrant youth who had previously left their homes in search of better opportunities are now returning to their communities. 


This shift follows key interventions by stakeholders designed to address the devastating effects of the dry spell in Ghana's Savannah region.


Migration, in this context, emerges not merely as a survival tactic but as a strategic adaptation to climate stress.




The Savannah Farmers Brigade (SFB), a leading agricultural organization, has launched initiatives to support farmers, primarily by promoting climate-smart agricultural practices.Testimonials of Return:


A 200-acre rice farm at the suburb of Buipe


Thirty-four-year-old Gifty Ibrahim, a native of Buipe, shared her experience of migration. 


She lost her six acres of maize and four acres of groundnuts to the dry spell, prompting her move to Kumasi in the Ashanti Region.



""The last dry spell affected my six-acre maize farm and also four acres of groundnuts and spoiled everything. So, I migrated to Kumasi and worked and sent the money home,"" she explained. ""When we travel, we'll be working and sending the money to the house so that when I return, I'll use that money to invest in a meaningful venture.""


Musah Naimah, another native of Buipe, first migrated to Accra in 2017 for greener pastures.


""I must say, all wasn't rosy there, especially what one would eat and where to sleep. But thank God, I was able to gather some money and returned home,"" Mrs. Naimah indicated.





SFB Farmers undergo training on double cropping at Buipe




These stories are increasingly common across the region, particularly in communities like Daboya, Mugrigu, Mpaha, and Bole, where migrant youth are now returning home equipped with financial and practical resources.


The Savannah Region is highly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns severely affecting agricultural productivity. 


According to the Savannah Region Department of Food and Agriculture, 105,922 young farmers were affected during the 2024 cropping season, including 54,491 males and 51,431 females


To address this challenge, farmers in the region are adopting climate-smart agricultural practices that enhance resilience and sustainability.




The Double Cropping Strategy


""We're working with partners to provide climate-resilient seeds, irrigation systems, and training to enhance farmers' adaptive capacities,"" said Gbenapewura Abdalla Mahama Adam, Executive Director of the Savannah Farmers Brigade.


One effective strategy being implemented is double cropping, which involves planting and harvesting two crops in a single season. 


This approach maximises the use of the rainy season and reduces the risk of crop failure. 




Farmers can, for example, plant maize in April and harvest it in June, followed by groundnuts or cowpea in July.


Mr. Lawrence Nuzagla, a 76-year-old farmer, is among the beneficiaries of the initiative.


""I started the double-cropping initiative in 1977 here in Kongo, and I must confess that it's very helpful. Through this method, some of my children have completed school and are in the working class,"" he stated. 


""I always plant groundnuts first, quickly harvest them in June, and then farm maize. Another time, I crop beans, harvest, and plant maize. This has been very helpful because I don't spend, but I get more money from it.""




Dabapewura Seidu Abdul Fatawu, a sub-chief of Buipe and commercial farmer with a 200-acre rice farm, chairs the Savannah Farmers Brigade and strongly endorses the initiative.





""Yes, planting twice a year is possible, and we [SFB] are already practising it. We sometimes plant watermelon, and right after harvesting, we plant maize,"" said Mr Fatawu. ""Another time, we plant maize, and after harvesting, we sell it fresh, get the money, and re-crop in the same land. Many farmers are not clear about the initiative, and that is why we, as an association, are training our farmers.""


Mrs. Joyce Beyuo also attested to the method's effectiveness.


""The entire idea or initiative is very good because it reduces labour costs and the risk of losing out to the dry weather,"" she emphasised. 




""In my first season of cropping, I planted maize once, but in the second season, I realised that I could plant twice. So, I started it with groundnuts in May, and after harvesting, I put in maize. I can tell you my income doubled as compared to the previous season when I planted once. Since then, I've been cropping twice a season, and some of my colleague nurses are also doing it.""


Research and Hope for the Future


The double cropping initiative was informed by a study conducted by Professor Francis Malongza, Lecturer and Head of the Department for Community Development Studies at the University for Development Studies, Tamale campus. 


His research in Wa, Bawku West, and Bongo focused on cultural influences on agriculture.





""The farmers in these areas have something similar—the pattern of rainfall and cropping period. So, we came up with the initiative for our farmers, and I can tell you that the benefits are huge,"" Professor Malongza noted.


""This initiative will increase crop yields, reduce poverty, improve food security, and enhance resilience to climate-related shocks.""


While the dry spell has severely impacted farming communities, the combined efforts of Professor Malongza and the Savannah Farmers Brigade are offering renewed hope, enabling farmers to adapt to climate variability, improve household income, and secure a more resilient agricultural sector.





The benefits of the double cropping initiative are significant. By planting two crops in a single season, farmers dramatically increase total harvests from the same plot of land. Testimonials from farmers like Mrs. Joyce Beyuo confirms that income can double compared to single-season planting.


The initiative maximizes the use of the rainy season, reduces the risk of total crop failure, and helps bridge rural poverty gaps. Higher and more consistent yields contribute directly to food security for both households and the wider community, making this strategy a cornerstone of climate adaptation in the Savannah Region.

When the sea vomits: Are our schools and hospitals ready?,"In Ghana’s most vulnerable coastal communities, the sea is no longer just swallowing homes, it is tearing at the very foundations of public infrastructure. As the coastline retreats year after year, schools, hospitals, and health centers are edging closer to collapse.




In communities such as Fuveme, Salakope, Agavedzi, Kporkporgbor, and Kedzikope, the question hangs heavily: When the sea vomits again, where will the people run?


In Fuveme, the school compound once echoed with laughter. Today, it stands fractured, its foundation eaten by waves.


Mr. Nyatefe, the headteacher, now holds classes under trees.


“I cannot risk the children’s lives,” he told JoyNews.




“When the tide is strong, the ground shakes. We have lost too much already.”


Three school blocks along this stretch have partially collapsed. Others stand dangerously close to the shoreline.


At the Kedzikope Health Centre, nurses work while watching the sea inch closer every day.For nurse Elorm, every night brings dread.





“When the waves hit the walls, I panic,” she admits. “We cannot run fast enough if something happens.”



Ambulances can no longer access flooded roads. Pregnant women now walk up to nine kilometres for care. Medical supplies are delayed for days because transport routes are repeatedly cut by water.


Infrastructure on a Tight Rope


Experts estimate that sections of Ghana’s coastline are eroding at over five meters a year.


That rate threatens: School buildings, health facilities, water and electricity lines, and community roads.




This deterioration is fueled by sea level rise, extreme tidal waves, sand mining, mangrove loss, and decades of unmanaged coastal development.





When a school collapses, children lose their right to education. When a clinic is cut off, lives are lost. When a community road vanishes, the entire local economy stalls.


The threat is not theoretical, it is unfolding now. Experts call for a national emergency plan, not piecemeal projects. Ghana must: reinforce or relocate endangered public facilities, restore mangroves to buffer the coastline, implement sustainable dredging, and build climate-resilient infrastructure.





“The sea is moving faster than policy,” a district official warns.




“If we delay, we will lose more than buildings; we will lose lives.”

EPA trains industry players on carbon market to boost revenue and youth employment,"The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has begun a training initiative aimed at equipping Ghanaians with the skills to tap into opportunities within the global carbon market, a sector the Authority believes can generate significant revenue for the nation while creating thousands of jobs for unemployed youth.




The maiden programme is expected to train about 25 participants to build their capacity in carbon market trading and position them to support both personal growth and national development.


Speaking to journalists at the training, which was held at the AB & David Hotel in Accra, the Chief Executive Officer of the EPA, Professor Nana Ama Browne Klutse, described the initiative as a crucial step in Ghana’s broader climate finance and sustainability agenda.


According to her, “the Environmental Protection Authority is, for the first time, doing a training on carbon markets. What we want to do is that the carbon market is trending in the world, and in Ghana, per our assessments, we have a huge carbon credit. We can trade for money and for technologies, renewable energy technologies that will help the country and help the citizens.”


Professor Klutse explained that over two years, the Authority has been building technical knowledge through its Carbon Market Office, and it is now time to extend that expertise across institutions and individuals nationwide.“We’ve done a lot of learning and had some experiences, and we need to expand it to other institutions in the country, other individuals to build their capacity in carbon market trading,” she stated.







She emphasised that the training will benefit not only participants but the country at large.“Apart from individual gains, the country also gains as one of the countries with credibility in carbon accreditation and carbon market experience. So that is why we are setting up this training.”


Professor Klutse noted that interest in the programme has been encouraging, with participants drawn from diverse organisations eager to understand carbon trading.“We have seen the participants coming from different institutions that are interested in carbon market trading. We believe this will be widespread through all other institutions.”


She revealed that the EPA intends to scale up the programme in response to demand.“This is the first one. We expect to have different cohorts after this first one, depending on the interest of people. And we believe that several institutions should be interested in this. This is a big opportunity for us to gain money and also to gain technology.”


Professor Klutse stressed that the economic potential is significant, adding that if properly harnessed, Ghana could attract up to 1 billion dollars in investments over the next four years and create an estimated 5,000 jobs.

"GNPC, Explorco reject allegations on West Cape Three Points valuation","The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and its subsidiary, GNPC Explorco, have refuted claims circulating in the media regarding Springfield Exploration and Production Limited’s interest in the West Cape Three Points Block 2.




The statements follow reports suggesting that GNPC and Explorco executives provided outdated data for the valuation of the block, leading to questions about potential overpayment of state funds.


Responding to the claims, GNPC and Explorco emphasised that “the Sewell report contains a disclaimer and states that the data used in the report was provided by Springfield solely.”


They added that Springfield did not communicate its intention to submit the data to Sewell for valuation, meaning “GNPC and Explorco had no knowledge of Springfield procuring this report.”


The corporations stressed that they could not have supplied the 2024 appraisal data, which some critics claimed was withheld.




On concerns that the valuation relied on the same dataset that previously led Ghana into arbitration, GNPC and Explorco reiterated that “it was Springfield’s sole decision to supply the 2020 GNPC data.”


They also clarified that Sewell’s use of the 2020 estimates was beyond their control, pointing out that “neither GNPC nor Explorco was responsible for providing the 2020 data.”


The agencies strongly rejected claims of a conspiracy to inflate the asset’s value, stating that “GNPC has not valued Springfield’s asset at US$700 million and has also not advised the Government to pay Springfield on the basis of any such valuation.”


They assured that the Government is conducting a “transparent process to engage a competent technical entity and a Transaction advisor to conduct an independent technical and commercial valuation” using up-to-date data, adding that all decisions are taken “in the best interest of the people of Ghana.”

NDC questions NPPs appeal before seeing Kpandai ruling reasoning,"The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has criticised the New Patriotic Party (NPP) for filing an appeal against the annulment of the Kpandai parliamentary election before the official reasoning of the court ruling is released.




The criticism by Rashid Tanko Computer, Deputy Director of Elections and IT for the NDC, comes in response to the NPP’s rejection of the Tamale High Court ruling, which annulled the 2024 parliamentary election in Kpandai and ordered a fresh poll following a petition by the NDC candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal.


The party has filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of execution, insisting that the ruling is flawed and the original results remain valid.


Speaking on JoyNews’ The Pulse on Monday, November 24, Tanko Computer described the NPP’s move as premature.


“They [NPP] have spoken about going for an appeal and filing a stay of execution. But have they even looked at the reasoning behind the ruling? 




""The judge just said our petition was upheld and that the reasoning will be given to us on Friday. You have not even seen it, and you’ve gone to file for appeal. What are you appealing for? So you see how interesting the NPP can be?” he said.

Retract false LGBT+ claims or face legal actionUG to Foh Amoaning,"The University of Ghana has issued a strong demand for an immediate retraction and public apology from private legal practitioner Moses Foh-Amoaning after he claimed the institution had amended its statutes to “admit LGBT+ activities"".




The claims, published by GhanaWeb on November 21 and attributed to comments made during an interview on Onua FM’s Yen Nsempa programme, were described by the university as “entirely false, misleading, and defamatory.”


In a statement released by management on November 24, the university clarified that its recent review of the 2024 Statutes did not introduce any provisions endorsing or promoting LGBT+ activities. 


Instead, the revisions simply replaced gender-specific pronouns such as “he” and “she” with gender-neutral terms, including “they” and “their”, reflecting modern English usage and removing the need for repetitive phrasing in legal documents.


The university stressed that the updates were conducted strictly in line with national laws and established governance procedures, noting that the singular “they” is now widely accepted across academic, legal, and religious texts.




The press statement further condemned what it termed an “unacceptable personal attack” on the vice-chancellor by Foh-Amoaning, asserting that no vice-chancellor has unilateral authority to amend university statutes. 


Any attempt to question her integrity on the basis of unfounded allegations, the university said, was both disrespectful and in bad faith.








The University has therefore demanded that Foh-Amoaning retract his comments without delay and issue a public apology to the Vice-Chancellor and the wider University community. 


It warned that failure to comply within a reasonable period would leave the institution with no choice but to pursue legal action under Ghanaian law to protect its integrity and leadership.



Management also urged media organisations to exercise greater responsibility when reporting on sensitive institutional matters, warning that the amplification of unverified claims undermines public trust and risks misleading the public.





The University reaffirmed its commitment to transparency, ethical governance, and its overarching mission of delivering global impact through teaching, learning, and research, insisting that it would not be distracted by baseless claims.

Mahama government determined to execute 24hr economy policy  Prof. Fosu-Mensah,"Lecturer and Communications Team Member of the governing National Democratic Congress (NDC), Prof Benedicta Fosu-Mensah, has reaffirmed the government’s commitment to fully implementing its flagship 24-hour economy policy.




Speaking on Metro TV on Monday, November 24, she emphasised that the initiative remains a central pillar of President John Dramani Mahama’s developmental agenda and will be pursued with seriousness and urgency.


According to Prof Fosu-Mensah, the 24-hour economy is designed to stimulate growth, boost productivity and create sustainable jobs across various sectors.


She argued that the policy goes beyond extended working hours, noting that it includes deliberate investments in security, energy stability and business incentives to ensure that round-the-clock economic activity is viable.


“This is not a slogan; it is a comprehensive economic strategy,” she said.




She explained that several ministries and state agencies have already begun aligning their operational frameworks to support the policy’s rollout.


Prof Fosu-Mensah added that the initiative will particularly benefit manufacturing, logistics, health, hospitality and digital services.


In her view, the long-term impact will be increased competitiveness, stronger local industries and expanded opportunities for young people entering the labour market.


Prof Fosu-Mensah concluded that the Mahama government’s determination to execute the 24-hour economy demonstrates its commitment to modernising Ghana’s economic architecture.



She urged the public to support the initiative, describing it as a transformational policy that will reposition Ghana for accelerated development.


“We are ready, prepared and focused on delivering this for the benefit of all Ghanaians,” she asserted.

"NPP rejects Kpandai election ruling, calls it dangerous and damaging to democracy","The New Patriotic Party (NPP) has strongly criticised the Tamale High Court ruling ordering a rerun of the 2024 parliamentary election in the Kpandai constituency, describing the decision as dangerous and a threat to Ghana’s democratic progress.




Speaking on JoyNews’ The Pulse on Monday, NPP Director of Elections and Research, Evans Nimako, said the party cannot accept the court’s decision, insisting it goes beyond the petitioner’s own claims.


“This cannot be a ruling that you expect the New Patriotic Party to say is a welcoming decision from a competent court of jurisdiction. For me, this is a dangerous ruling. The intent is to erode all the political and democratic gains we've made as a country,” he said.


Mr. Nimako argued that the petitioner’s case involved alleged infractions in 41 out of 152 polling stations.


Yet, the court annulled the results for the entire constituency instead of focusing on the areas in dispute.




“A petitioner comes to court with a plea that in 41 polling stations there have been some infractions, and you then give a ruling that, assuming, without admitting, that yes, the 41 had issues, the other 111, where there were no issues, should also be cancelled? What kind of dangerous ruling is this?” he questioned.


He added that the NPP won the seat by a margin of nearly 4,000 votes, securing 53.47% of the total ballots cast, and therefore finds it difficult to understand why the whole election should be annulled.


“This is a constituency the party won decisively. And you are telling me that you, the judge, will go beyond the plea of the petitioner? I don’t think this is the way to go,” he stressed.


The party has already filed an appeal, insisting that the ruling is legally flawed and must be overturned.

SML scandal: SML seeks probe into court allocation,"Strategic Mobilisations Limited (SML), one of the accused entities in the ongoing legal battle between the state and 8 other accused persons over a revenue assurance deal filed by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), has formally petitioned the Criminal Court registry over the allocation of its matter to Criminal Court 3.




In a petition dated Monday, November 24, the company, represented by Boyuo Law, alleges discrepancies in the court assignment process.


According to the petition, the company attended a meeting with the Special Prosecutor on 20th November 2025, where it was formally served with the charge sheet and instructed to appear in Criminal Court 3 on 24th November for its plea. 


However, upon visiting the court registry to confirm the allocation, the company was informed that the case had not been assigned to any court and the docket was not before the registry. 


Petition for investigation[1]Download


According to them, a follow-up visit on 21st November reportedly confirmed the same.




The petition requests an investigation into the court allocation process, noting that the Special Prosecutor appeared to be aware of the court assignment prior to any official allocation by the registry. 


Boyuo Law has formally called on the Criminal Court registrar to look into the matter, emphasising adherence to proper judicial procedures.

In all, 78 charges were filed against former finance minister Mr Ofori-Atta, including SML, ranging from conspiracy to influence the procurement process to alleged breaches of the Public Procurement Act.



Other accused include former GRA Commissioners-General Dr Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah and Emmanuel Kofi Nti; senior GRA officials Isaac Crentsil and Kwadwo Damoa; former Finance Ministry Technical Advisor Ernest Akore; SML owner Evans Adusei; and Strategic Mobilisation Limited.

SanlamAllianz launches Sika Nkomo to help Ghanaians build financial confidence,"SanlamAllianz in Ghana has unveiled “Sika Nkomo”, a new financial education campaign designed to help Ghanaians, especially those in the informal economy, take charge of their money and secure their futures through practical lessons on savings, budgeting, and insurance.




Rooted in SanlamAllianz’s purpose to empower generations to be financially confident, secure, and prosperous, the Sika Nkomo campaign is part of a wider African initiative promoting financial literacy and inclusion. It is a bold step toward making financial literacy not just a privilege, but a way of life for everyone: from market traders and artisans to young professionals and small business owners.


 “Sika Nkomo” simply means “Money Talk.” That's exactly what this campaign is about- open, relatable conversations around money management that speak to the realities of everyday Ghanaians. 





The company aims to demystify financial concepts and show that good money habits are not complicated theories; they’re practical tools anyone can use to improve their lives. 


Building Confidence, One Lesson at a Time The campaign focuses on four core pillars that build long-term financial confidence: 




● Budgeting and financial discipline: Learning how to plan your spending and live within your means.


● Setting financial goals and saving regularly: Developing consistent habits that turn small savings into lasting security. 


● Understanding insurance: Realizing that insurance isn’t just for the wealthy but also for anyone who wants peace of mind when life takes an unexpected turn. 


● Growing financial confidence: Empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their money and future. For many Ghanaians in the informal sector, financial education can be life-changing. 



As one local trader shared- “One illness or fire can erase years of hard work; but with insurance, you can bounce back.” This is the kind of real-life perspective Sika Nkomo seeks to highlight that financial protection is a foundation for resilience, not a luxury. 


According to Tawiah BEN-AHMED, Chief Executive Officer of Sanlam Allianz Life Insurance Ghana LTD, Sika Nkomo is more than a campaign; it is a movement to bridge Ghana’s financial literacy gap and help individuals and families build stronger financial futures. “Our end goal is to make sure that every Ghanaian becomes financially confident, be able to finance planned expenses and have the peace of mind that unplanned expenses will also be covered.” He said.


By partnering with media platforms such as Pulse Ghana and the Multimedia Group, SanlamAllianz in Ghana is bringing Sika Nkomo to screens and smartphones nationwide, ensuring that every Ghanaian can learn, engage, and take practical steps toward financial freedom.

FDA seizes 98 unregistered herbal medicines in Accra,"The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has confiscated 98 unregistered herbal medicinal products during a market surveillance operation conducted between November 22 and 24, 2025, at Awoshie, and Boundary Road in Accra.




The seized items include popular products such as Amenazel Herbal Tonic, Amenazel Herbal Bitters, and Poget Herbal Mixture, all of which were being sold without the required FDA registration.


According to the Authority, the exercise forms part of ongoing nationwide efforts to protect public health by removing unapproved and potentially unsafe products from the market.


The FDA cautioned traders and manufacturers who continue to distribute unregistered products, stressing that enforcement activities will intensify in the coming weeks.


“To those selling unregistered products, we will not relent in our commitment to ensuring public health and safety, so sooner than you think we will get to you,” the Authority warned.




All seized products will undergo safe disposal in line with FDA protocols.

Hearts can still win the league  defiant Didi Dramani charges,"Head coach of Accra Hearts of Oak, Mas-Ud Didi Dramani has said the Phobians can win the Ghana Premier League despite their inconsistent form.




Hearts have slipped into sixth place, five points behind leaders Aduana Stars after Sunday's goalless draw at Young Apostles.


That result was the sixth draw recorded by the Phobians in eleven games, leading to questions about their title credentials.


However, Didi Dramani remains confident that the Phobians can turn the corner and launch a charge for the title. 


“It’s still possible to win the league because we have over thirty matches more to play. We just have to turn our drawing streak to wins. If you want to win the league, you have to win games.”




On Sunday's draw, the sixth game in which the Phobians had failed to score, Dramani said their opponents raised their game.


“I think the game was what we anticipated. And we knew they would be motivated for the game because they were playing against Hearts of Oak. It was a game of few chances and more transitional plays.”


Hearts have won just one match in the month of November; the 2-1 victory over Basake Holy Stars.


The Phobians face Vision F.C, Karela United and Nations F.C. in their next three league matches.

EOCO boss Raymond Archer on why there should be tougher bail conditions for suspects,"The Acting Executive Director of the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), Raymond Archer, has defended the ""tougher"" bail conditions being applied in recent economic crime cases, saying low sureties make it easy for suspects to evade accountability.




Speaking on Joy FM’s Newsfile programme on Saturday [November 23, 2025], the Acting Executive Director of EOCO said bail must reflect the scale of financial exposure in ongoing investigations.


“I consider bail and sureties, or I liken it to the collateral you give for a loan,” he said. “When you give collateral that is less than the loan you take, there’s no motivation to pay back.”


Mr Archer said suspects involved in economic offences cannot be treated like ordinary offenders. “Assume at every point that every criminal is at least above average. The fact that you beat the barricade compliance and everybody to steal that money tells you it's not your average job,” he stated.


He warned that lenient bail terms allow suspects in major financial cases to avoid accountability. “You can let the loans go run itself and then there’s no collateral to fall back on and you let [it] go into default. In the same way, bail is connected to a case.”




Drawing from EOCO’s work on complex financial crimes, Mr Archer said the office frequently handles cases involving vast sums. “We do a lot of investigation for the banks, for example, where somebody has stolen $90 million,” he said. “Then you give him a bail of $20 million.”


His remarks come amid public debate over the rising bail amounts seen in recent high-profile arrests.


In May 2025, the Ashanti Regional Chairman of the opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP), Bernard Antwi Boasiako, commonly known as “Chairman Wontumi”, was granted bail of GH¢50 million with two sureties after he was charged by EOCO for alleged financial loss to the state. Opposition MPs objected to the conditions, with the Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin calling the bond “unfair and unreasonable”.


In June, former National Food Buffer Stock Company CEO Abdul Hannan Wahab and his wife, Faiza Seidu Wuni, were granted bail of GH¢50 million and GH¢30 million, respectively. In October, the court revised the terms, raising Mr Wahab’s bail to GH¢100 million and his wife’s to GH¢50 million. Lawyers for the couple argued that the new amounts were harsh and out of proportion.



Just this November, the former Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation (BOST) Managing Director, Edwin Provencal was arrested by EOCO and initially given a GH¢60 million bail.


The court later reduced it to GH¢30 million with two sureties and a requirement to surrender his passport. EOCO has since asked the court to toughen the conditions, saying the sureties should be justified to match the state’s exposure.


Mr Archer maintained that the principle guiding EOCO’s approach is straightforward. “The exposure of the risk must be matched. If not, the Republic will have no leverage,” he said.

Inside Ghanas endless galamsey war: When the problem lives within the system,"For more than five decades, illegal mining, popularly known as galamsey, has remained one of Ghana’s most stubborn national challenges. Its impact cuts across the social, economic, cultural and environmental fabric of the country. Despite several government interventions, military deployments and public campaigns, the problem keeps resurfacing. The persistence of galamsey suggests something deeper: the very actors expected to solve the crisis are, in many ways, connected to the systems sustaining it.




Recent events, from the destruction of farmlands in Manso to the pollution of the Birim and Ankobra Rivers reported earlier this year, remind Ghanaians that the fight is far from over. The issue is not simply about illegal miners but about politics, regulation, unemployment, technology and a changing national value system.


Contributors of Galamsey


One of the biggest drivers is campaign financing. Election seasons often come with a surge in illegal mining activities as politicians seek funds from powerful financiers, some of whom have questionable connections to mining concessions. Ahead of the 2024 elections, for instance, videos circulated online showing political financiers displaying gold bars from their supposed legal concessions yet many of these operations were suspected to be linked to illegal sites.


This mirrors earlier controversies, such as the 2023 reports of party-affiliated individuals operating illegally in forest reserves despite government crackdowns. When those who shape policy benefit from mining proceeds, genuine enforcement becomes difficult.




Another concern is the weak monitoring of the financial activities of party financiers. Many hold small-scale mining licences but move their operations to water bodies or protected forests, where verification is limited. Regulatory bodies have struggled to effectively track such diversions. 


Weak Regulation, Poor Tracking


Several investigative reports have highlighted how heavy-duty machines were used for galamsey. The excavators and bulldozers costing up to $50,000 enter the country without proper VIN documentation. In 2020, after the government announced a seizure of excavators, many mysteriously vanished. Without accurate tracking at the ports, monitoring these machines becomes nearly impossible.


This exposes serious gaps within regulatory systems meant to protect our lands and rivers.



Nepotism and Selective Justice


Nepotism also plays a role. The issuance of more than 100 mining licences near the end of an administration’s term raises questions about transparency and fairness. Beyond that, the involvement of some foreign nationals, especially Chinese operators, continues to complicate the fight. There have been recorded cases where arrested foreign galamsey suspects disappeared after detention, while local youths faced harsher penalties.


This creates the perception of selective justice and undermines public trust in governance.


Gaps in Innovation and Education




Galamsey thrives partly because Ghana has not invested enough in modern mining technologies that allow safe, low-impact mineral extraction. Small-scale miners often rely on outdated and environmentally destructive techniques.


Traditional values of environmental protection, once taught in schools and practised in communities, have faded. Today, different professionals view the galamsey problem from different angles, yet the education system rarely offers a united, multidisciplinary approach to help students understand the full picture of environmental responsibility.


Youth Unemployment and the Rush for Quick Wealth


High unemployment continues to push thousands of young people into galamsey. For many rural families, illegal mining is the fastest option for income, despite the risks.




The desire for fast money has also grown, fueled by social pressure, political displays of wealth and a lack of economic opportunities. As long as young people believe galamsey is their only path to survival or success, the practice will continue.


The Way Forward


The key to eradicating galamsey is providing sustainable alternative livelihoods. Force alone cannot solve the problem. Lasting change requires tackling unemployment and underemployment, especially in mining communities. Government and private sector actors can support alternative income sources such as livestock rearing, vegetable farming, vocational training and guaranteed market access for local produce. When communities have stable economic opportunities, they are far less likely to depend on illegal mining.


Strengthening regulations and deploying technology are also crucial. All excavators and bulldozers imported into Ghana should be fitted with GPS or similar tracking devices. Customs and the Minerals Commission must ensure that VIN numbers are properly recorded and verified. Regular inspections at registered mining sites should be mandatory to confirm that operations remain within approved boundaries. Clear penalties must be applied consistently and without political or personal interference.




The government must also reform the system to serve the public good rather than a select few. Licensing processes should be transparent, and state agencies must be insulated from political pressure. Ghana’s mining laws need updating to reflect the scale and complexity of today’s galamsey challenges.


Finally, restoring community values through the education system can help revive cultural practices that once protected the environment. Integrating environmental stewardship, civic responsibility and indigenous conservation knowledge into school curricula will help young people develop a stronger sense of communal duty. This approach can counter the growing “quick-money” mindset and nurture a generation that values sustainability.


Conclusion


Galamsey has survived decades of policy interventions because the problem is deeply rooted in governance, politics and economic hardship. There is undeniable evidence of complicity at multiple levels of the system. While punitive measures have their place, the real solution requires strategy, innovation and an honest commitment to reform.




Ending galamsey is not a battle of force; it is a test of leadership, integrity and national will. Through transparent regulation, practical alternatives for communities and a renewed sense of environmental responsibility, Ghana can build a stronger social contract and finally turn the tide against illegal mining.

EU warns Ghana and Cote dIvoire to reform cocoa sector or risk losing global market share,"Ghana and neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire are facing renewed pressure from the European Union and French development partners to fast-track long-delayed reforms in the cocoa sector, amid warnings that both countries could lose competitiveness under emerging global sustainability standards.




The call came during a two-day Cocoa4Future feedback workshop in Accra, where researchers presented findings from a five-year EU- and AFD-funded project examining agroforestry systems, disease control, certification schemes, farmer livelihoods, and climate resilience across both countries.


EU officials were clear: unless agroforestry adoption accelerates, deforestation is curtailed, and labour-related risks addressed, West African cocoa could face mounting barriers under new European sustainability rules and stricter buyer requirements.


The research highlighted sector vulnerabilities and pathways for reform. Studies confirmed that many farmers prefer low- to no-shade systems, which boost short-term yields but compromise ecological resilience and long-term productivity. 


This approach, researchers warned, undermines forest recovery and leaves cocoa landscapes highly vulnerable to climate change.




On disease management, Cocoa Swollen Shoot Disease (CSSVD) remains widespread, reducing yields by up to 202 kg per hectare in severely affected farms. 


Farmer-led control methods, such as pruning infected parts or using chemicals, are largely ineffective. 


Researchers recommended intensifying rehabilitation programmes, scaling the production of CSSVD-resistant seedlings, and expanding technical training for early detection.


Certification studies showed that Fairtrade and Organic schemes significantly improve yields, incomes, and job creation, but their impact on broader food security and working conditions is uneven. 



Researchers stressed the need for stronger cooperatives, expanded extension services, affordable credit, and diversified buyer networks to improve certification outcomes.


Across all themes, the recommendations were consistent: governments must ramp up input distribution, clarify tree tenure rights, promote hybrid cocoa varieties, incentivise agroforestry adoption, and formalise support systems for farmer livelihoods, including pensions, credit, and modern farm equipment.


Development partners stressed that these evidence-based measures are critical as the global market shifts decisively toward traceable, climate-resilient, and ethically sourced cocoa—standards that Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire risk falling behind if reforms stall.

UK rejects Nigerias request to transfer Ekweremadu to Nigeria to complete prison sentence,"The United Kingdom has declined a request from the Nigerian government to allow former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu to complete his prison sentence in Nigeria.




Ekweremadu is serving time in a UK facility after he was found guilty in 2023 of plotting to harvest the kidney of a young man.


The former lawmaker received a jail term of nine years and eight months following the conviction, which stemmed from a high-profile organ-trafficking case that drew international attention.


Recently, the Federal Government, led by Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar, met with officials at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to discuss the case of Ekweremadu.


The delegation requested his deportation so he could serve his remaining sentence in Nigeria.Ads by




However, according to The Guardian UK, a source at the MoJ has confirmed the request was rejected.


The news platforms reported that the UK government was concerned that Nigeria could offer no guarantees that Ekweremadu would continue his prison sentence after being deported.


A source is reported to have said that: “The UK will not tolerate modern slavery and any offender will face the full force of UK law.”


With this development, Ekweremadu will remain in the UK to serve out the remainder of his sentence.



Meanwhile, his wife, Beatrice Ekweremadu, who was sentenced to four years and six months, with half spent in custody, was released earlier this year and has since returned to Nigeria.

KasoaWinneba highway set for June 2026 completion  Kwame Agbodza gives firm timeline,"The Kasoa–Winneba stretch of the coastal highway is expected to be completed by June 2026, Roads and Highways Minister Kwame Governs Agbodza has confirmed.




Speaking on the progress of ongoing road projects on Channel One TV on Monday, November 24, Agbodza said, “The contractor says that by June next year it will all be done.”


He added, “For the Winneba to Mankessim section, the contract allows for two years, but I am confident it will be completed before 2027.”


He noted that once these projects are finished, the route from Kasoa to Takoradi will be fully dualised, enhancing connectivity between the Greater Accra and Central Regions.


The Kasoa–Winneba–Mankessim project involves three separate contractors, while the Cape Coast to Takoradi section is handled by another.




Agbodza, who is also the Member of Parliament for Adaklu, explained that the Cape Coast to Takoradi road is a larger project that links the two regions. Within the Central Region, the Kasoa–Winneba and Winneba–Mankessim sections are progressing steadily.


“When you travel from Winneba to Mankessim, we are building a brand new road alongside the existing one to dualise it. The Winneba interchange was not initially part of the project, but it has now been included,” he added.


Addressing the traffic bottlenecks experienced this year on the Kasoa–Winneba section, the Minister acknowledged that construction planning had contributed to delays.


“We made a mistake when we started working on the main carriageway and the expansion at the same time. This led to many of the bottlenecks we saw,” he said.



Once completed, the dual carriageway will significantly improve travel along the coastal corridor, supporting trade and easing congestion for motorists.

The Budget that saw Angels and Demons at the same time,"LETTER TO THE CITIZENS OF UNCOMMON SENSE




Dear Citizens of Uncommon Sense,


Once again, our annual national ritual has taken place. Not Akwasidae. Not Hogbetsotso. I refer to that grand festival where our Honourables wear their best suits, sharpen their tongues, and perform economic jazz like seasoned palm-wine guitarists. Yes — The Great Parliamentary Budget Drama.


This year, the Finance Minister entered the chamber holding the 2026 Budget as if it were freshly baked communion bread. The title alone — “Resetting for Growth, Jobs & Economic Transformation” — was heavy enough to require its own seatbelt. In this Republic, the longer a budget title is, the shorter its lifespan after reading.


The moment the Minister cleared his throat, Parliament transformed into a theatre. Majority MPs adjusted their ties with the confidence of ushers at a VIP wedding. Minority MPs sharpened their eyebrows until you could use them to slice cassava. The Speaker closed his eyes briefly, perhaps whispering, “Oh Lord, if today You must take someone, please take the microphones first.”




Citizens, the Majority rose faster than your data bundles get finished. These were people spiritually prepared for praise. They clapped with techniques—two claps and a nod, three claps and a gentle smile, one clap mixed with “Hear! Hear!” For them, this budget was not a document; it was an economic deliverance service.


One MP proclaimed, “This is the staircase to Ghana’s prosperity!” Another shouted, “Inflation is tamed!” Someone added, “Growth is reset!” And a patriotic optimist declared, “We are becoming Singapore!”


The way they were testifying, I almost believed the budget contained free petrol, a bag of rice, and one month’s supply of encouragement for every household.


Then, dear citizens, the Minority rose.



Slowly. Like a lion whose nap has been disrespected.


These were not people who came to clap. Their faces carried the same look your father gives when school fees are due but your report card reads like a police caution statement. Their leader sighed — not an ordinary sigh, but the heavy sigh of a nation carrying tomatoes priced like foreign exchange.


“Honourable Speaker…” he began. “This budget…”


He paused long enough for the Majority to start sweating.




“…is a decorated empty bowl.”


Chaos.


The Majority murmured and rolled their eyes like teenagers. Another Minority MP, wearing the face of a disappointed mathematics master, said, “This is poetry. Beautiful, yes — but still poetry.” One added, “A reset without a remote. A promise without a plan. A slogan wearing agbada.” At that point, even the Speaker’s glasses felt pressure.


The Majority shouted, “You don’t love Ghana!”




The Minority replied, “We love Ghana. We just don’t love fiction.”


My dear citizens, this is why Parliament deserves Netflix rights.


Soon, they entered their favourite national sport: the Point of Order Olympics.


“Mr Speaker, he is misleading the House!”




“Mr Speaker, the budget is misleading the country!”


Withdraw! Don’t withdraw! Withdraw something — anything!


At a point, the Speaker stared into the distance like a headmaster regretting his life choices.


Meanwhile, outside Parliament, the real economy was running its own commentary.




At Kaneshie, tomatoes were still behaving like they attended a private school. Bread was rising as if it had joined a charismatic church. Transport fares were galloping like horses on Easter Monday.


A market woman shouted, “Budget? My brother, bring your money first before you talk big English.”


At Suame, a mechanic whispered, “If this budget is resetting anything, let it reset the price of spare parts.”


In a trotro, one man said, “They say inflation has dropped,” and the other replied, “Yes, it dropped — but it didn’t land here.”




Citizens, when Parliament debates graphs, the streets debate survival.


Economists then appeared on TV holding graphs resembling ECG bills. Political commentators explained fiscal policy using proverbs. WhatsApp groups flooded with “leaked budget documents” typed by the same people who think GDP is a football club.


By midday, the country had seventeen interpretations of the same document, eleven “corrected explanations,” and three conspiracy theories — one involving dwarfs and another involving Dubai.


But let me tell you the truth as your humble Correspondent-General:


A Ghanaian budget does not succeed until kenkey drops in price,


until onions calm down,


and until ECG bills stop misbehaving like toddlers in a supermarket.


When trotro drivers reduce fares without threats, that is economic transformation.


Until then, we remain in the Republic of Uncommon Sense —


where the Majority sees gold,


the Minority sees ghosts,


and the average citizen sees the same market prices staring back with disrespect.


Yes, the budget will pass. It always does.


But will it land? That, dear citizens, is the true question.


As the elders say:


“You don’t judge a farmer by the size of his cutlass, but by the size of his harvest.”


And so we wait — patiently, skeptically, and with calculators in hand — for the harvest.


Yours in patriotic bewilderment,


Jimmy AglahRepublic of Uncommon Sense

MIIF Board blows GH11m on unapproved foreign trips as confidential audit exposes massive breach,"Confidential documents intercepted by JOYNEWS have revealed how the board and key management staff of the Minerals Income Investment Fund (MIIF) spent over GH¢11 million on foreign travels in 2024 without government approval. 




In 2020, the Ministry of Finance issued a directive that no public service officer shall travel on official business without prior approval. 


Such travel must be cleared through the Chief of Staff. However, management of MIIF disregarded this administrative guideline. 


According to the confidential report by the Ghana Audit Service, the board and key management of MIIF spent more than GH¢11 million on foreign travel in 2024 without the required approvals. 


The report indicated that the trips were undertaken without prior authorisation from the Chief of Staff, the sector minister, or the Chief Director.




The Administrative Guidelines for the Implementation of Foreign Travel Allowances, issued by the Ministry of Finance in October 2020, stipulate that public servants of the rank of Director and below must seek approval from the sector minister or, where applicable, the Chief Director. This was not followed.


Auditors noted that MIIF’s disregard for this directive led to the infraction. In response to the findings, MIIF’s Head of Human Resources stated that all travels requiring approval from the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Director were duly cleared. 


He added that, for international travel requests involving public servants above the Director grade, the HR and Administration Department acted on directives from the CEO’s secretariat, and all request memos were available for verification.


Former MIIF CEO Edward Nana Yaw Koranteng, however, maintained that the Chief of Staff at the time had been informed of all the trips. 



But the auditors noted that no correspondence between MIIF and the Office of the Chief of Staff was provided to support this claim.


Appearing before the Public Accounts Committee recently to respond to concerns about high expenditure on conferences and related activities.


Acting MIIF CEO Justina Nelson explained that the spending was necessary to give the Fund the visibility and capacity needed to operate its new office.


Another audit of MIIF’s financial statements and annual report revealed that the Fund also spent more than GH¢2 million on sitting allowances within two years.

I was told Daddy Lumba married Odo Broni  Family head tells court,"Abusuapanin Kofi Owusu, head of the extended family of legendary highlife musician Daddy Lumba, says he was told the late musician married Priscilla Ofori, also known as Odo Broni.




During cross-examination in court, he said Odo Broni and some family members told him about the said marriage with the musician born Charles Kwadwo Fosuh.


The alleged marriage between Priscilla Ofori, who has six children with Daddy Lumba, is being contested by Akosua Serwaa Fosuh, who is praying the court to declare her the only surviving wife and also to restrain Priscilla Ofori from identifying as the wife of the late Charles Kwadwo Fosuh.


Serwaa Fosuh's counsel, William Kusi, during cross-examination on Friday, November 21, 2025, asked Abusuapanin Owusu if he attended the marriage ceremony between Odo Broni and Daddy Lumba in 1991; he answered in the negative.


According to the family head, he met Odo Broni for the first time at the late musician’s residence upon his death in 2025.




Giving more details in court, the Abusuapanin said he got to know Daddy Lumba married Odo Broni customarily in April 2010 at Tantra Hills. 


Upon receipt of the news of Lumba’s death, he sent two of his nephews to visit the house of Charles Kwadwo Fosuh for confirmation. 


However, Priscilla Ofori declined to talk to him on the phone, at a time when she was crying throughout.


The Abusuapanin told the court it was around this time that he said in some media interviews that he did not know Priscilla Ofori to be Daddy Lumba's wife.



All this while, he had known Akosua Serwaa as the only wife of the late musician.


Testifying under oath, Abusuapanin Owusu said he exclaimed when Priscila Ofori told him she had six kids with the late musician and that she was customarily married to the late musician. She then introduced to him those who contracted the marriage and those who took the head drink.


According to him, Daddy Lumba's youngest sister, Faustina Fosuh, who is currently indisposed, confirmed the marriage between his deceased brother and Priscilla Ofori.


As customs demand, he presented Akosua Serwaa with drinks to officially inform her family of the passing of her husband, since she was also a wife.




But Abusuapaning Owusu told the court his attention was later drawn by his own family that Akosua Serwaa had returned her head drinks (tsir nsa) to the family, signalling the dissolution of the marriage.


The case continues at the Kumasi High Court.

Revisiting failure of African leadership through the lenses of former CUG VC,"It has been said in many forums that Africa’s problems are caused by poor leadership and a bad governance style. This means that the leadership style of most African leaders has largely, have not helped to rid the continent of underdevelopment. This kind of leadership has rather inhibited growth and development and left Africa deprived and dependent on others.




In a speech during his visit to the Parliament of Ghana in 2009, then President Barack Obama of the US suggested that Africa did not need strong men, but strong institutions. This indicates how African leaders have exhibited authoritativeness, which has not helped the continent to evolve a good governance system with its attendant impact on development.


Perhaps the solution lies elsewhere; the solution to Africa’s problems lies with a very simple type of leadership. This style of leadership produces results even though it is not popular with the African ruling class. This type of leadership is what is described by the former Vice Chancellor (VC) of the Catholic University of Ghana (CUG), Sir Professor Daniels Obeng Ofori, as selfless leadership that is geared towards problem-solving. The professor made this revelation on Saturday in his farewell message as the immediate past VC of the CUG during the investiture of a new VC.


In his message, the professor asked the new Vice Chancellor to “show mutual respect to all staff, from labourer to cleaner to the professor and student alike.” He also asked the VC to take “the contribution of all staff and inspire them to put in their best. By so doing, you will receive manifold respect from all staff and students.”


Listening to him, I realised the extent to which most leaders have turned the tables when it comes to respect. The leadership we are used to in Africa is one in which the leader demands respect from followers instead of setting the pace for reciprocity of respect. As such, most leaders would not regard people below them, not to mention respecting labourers and cleaners, as the professor indicates.




In that case, since respect ought to be mutual, subordinates may also not respect the leader, and when respect is absent, it is automatically replaced by fear for the leader. In this state of fear, not friendliness, the leader then would have taken God out of the picture. He or she becomes the “strong man” in the realm who would be cracking the whip instead of helping members to fit into the socio-political structure. To this, Prof Obeng Ofori observes that, “If you are following God, then leading people becomes about helping them to discover what God is calling them to do, not just getting them to do what you want to do. Be celebrative instead of authoritative.”


Then comes the issue of failure to understand the essence of leadership. A leader is supposed to create wealth and prosperity, which would affect lives and advance the purpose of God for humanity. This can be done only when leaders are innovative to bring out interventions that produce development. But how can one attract such innovations? As Professor Obeng Ofori suggests, such innovations would come from the right source, which is inspiration from God, not from the ambition of the leader.


In that regard, the professor indicates that, “True innovation is not about impressing people with how clever you are; it’s about discovering the solutions that God wants to bring into the world through you. There is a difference between innovation that comes through human ambition and innovation that comes from divine inspiration. Both can produce impressive results, but only one can produce lasting transformation. When you are innovative from ambition, you are limited by your own possibilities; when you innovate by divine inspiration, you are connected to the infinite wisdom and unlimited possibilities.”


By this assertion, the challenges we are facing as Africans are because we allow leadership to become a contest between people, with each contender showing how ambitious he or she can be. This would therefore lead to ambition, which cannot promote the well-being of anybody other than the agenda of the “ambitious man.” If you take a look at the Ghanaian national politics, for instance, election after election, all politicians do is to hurriedly put together manifestoes which are nothing but deceptive documents. In the end, because those documents present the ambitions of people, they do nothing for anybody, and our plight continues.



If we are to listen to the professor, we would go for the inspiration from God, which would bring us true innovations and help us solve our problems. This means that most African leaders have put aside the infinite wisdom of God, which has robbed the continent of the unlimited possibilities for development.


This is not an attempt to bring religion into governance and leadership; it is just to suggest that one cannot by him or herself do anything extraordinary because we are human and are limited. This means that God has a role to play in how successful we become, not just by being religious, but by allowing Him to assist us in what we do. “Please remember that God designed you, so he is not waiting for you to prove your worth through your work; rather, God is waiting for you to trust him with your work. Rather, when you are trying to prove your worth, everything centres around you; when you are trusting God with your work, every project becomes something bigger than yourself,” Professor Obeng Ofori explained.


Finally, true leadership is also about humility to accept failure. Most of the time, when people fail in a particular endeavour, pride prevents them from accepting the reality of the failure. Rather, they arrogantly suggest that they are still winning even though everything suggests otherwise. But, according to the professor, failure only helps to reveal our state. He says, “It is exciting to see failure as a sign that you need God; failure is not the enemy of our purpose, sometimes it is the pathway to our purpose.”


Our challenges as Africans are because we have failed to understand the role of leadership in development. Africa can be free only if it rids itself of bad leadership and promotes persons with the right leadership qualities. It is time to say no to strong and authoritative leadership, and promote simple, humble and genuine leaders with the capacity to turn our fortunes around.

"Food glut, tomato scarcity: Why Ghana has too much rice but not enough tomatoes","Across many rice-growing belts in Ghana, from Fumbisi in the Upper East Region to Nasia in the North East and Ohiamadwen in the Western Region, farmers are watching mountains of bagged paddy rice sit idle in warehouses. This season has produced one of the largest gluts of locally grown rice in years, yet thousands of bags remain unsold.




The government tried to mop up this excess with GH¢200 million, but this amount has been described as “a drop in the ocean” by the National Food Buffer Stock Company, which requested around GH¢700 million to buy up excess rice and maize.


Ironically, while Ghana has more rice than it can absorb in the short term, the country is battling an acute scarcity of tomatoes. Markets are overflowing with plantain, cassava and garden eggs, but fresh tomatoes are scarce and expensive. The two extremes show a food system that swings between surplus and shortage, putting both farmers and consumers under stress.


This feature explores how Ghana arrived at this troubling imbalance, why rice farmers are struggling to survive even amid bumper harvests, and why tomatoes remain out of reach for many households.


A Country of Contradiction: Too Much Rice, Too Few Tomatoes




The word “glut” has been used many times in Ghana’s food conversations, but nowhere is it more evident today than in the country’s rice sector. Several regions have recorded bumper harvests, especially after years of sustained cultivation under agricultural programmes and expansions in irrigated rice fields. But without enough buyers, processors or storage facilities, the output has outstripped market demand. Farmers in Fumbisi, for instance, say that out of thousands of bags harvested, only a fraction have been purchased by market actors.


Meanwhile, tomatoes, one of the most widely consumed vegetables, are scarce. In major markets in Accra and Kumasi, traders display tall heaps of cassava, plantain and garden eggs, but offer only small portions of tomatoes at painful prices. A small bowl of tomatoes can cost more than an entire bunch of plantains. Meanwhile, in September 2025, the government had to step in to purchase 1,000 boxes of tomatoes and 2,000 bags of onions cultivated by farmers in the Ashanti Region due to an abundance.


The market seems to be screaming two messages at once: Ghana cannot manage abundance, and it cannot prevent scarcity.


Rice Glut: How We Produced Too Much Without a Market



This year’s rice glut is the climax of several intersecting factors:


1. Expanded Production Encouraged by Previous Success


After earlier years of strong demand for local rice, many farmers increased their acreage. Government programmes under Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ), combined with improved seed varieties and expanded irrigation in schemes like Tono and Vea, boosted production. Farmers invested heavily buying fertiliser, hiring labour, and renting harvesters, expecting a profitable season.


2. Lack of Storage and Processing Capacity




Though Ghana repeatedly encourages consumption of local rice, the country still lacks sufficient milling and storage capacity. The absence of a robust warehouse receipt system means farmers cannot store paddy for future sale or use it as collateral for financing.


3. Competition from Imported Rice


Despite campaign after campaign promoting “Eat Ghana Rice,” imported rice continues to dominate the market. Urban consumers often prefer the uniformity and appearance of imported brands, making it difficult for local rice to compete. This season, rice importers have not slowed down, so farmers are battling both oversupply and weaker demand.


Why Tomatoes Are Scarce: Seasonal and Structural Realities




If rice shows Ghana’s problem with abundance, tomatoes show its ongoing struggle with scarcity. Tomato production faces a unique set of challenges that make the country chronically dependent on imports.


1. Seasonal Production and Climate Pressures


Tomato farming in Ghana is tied to specific cycles. Regions like Akomadan, Tuobodom, and the northern irrigation schemes produce tomatoes only during peak seasons when conditions are right. This year, irregular rainfall and heat waves disrupted expected yields. Pest outbreaks, especially the notorious Tuta Absoluta in Nigeria, wiped out large acres of tomato farms.


2. Dependence on Imports From Burkina Faso and Niger




Ghana relies heavily on fresh tomatoes from Burkina Faso and Niger during the lean season. When production or logistics issues hit those countries, Ghana feels the pinch immediately. Recent insecurity and high transport costs on the Burkina Faso–Ghana corridor have limited supply and increased spoilage.


3. Weak Local Production Systems


Tomato farmers currently operate in an environment where: irrigation systems are inadequate, farm inputs are unaffordable, storage systems are nonexistent, and market linkages are weak.


The Root of Ghana’s Food Imbalance




Ghana’s seasonal food imbalance, excess of some crops and shortage of others, comes from deeper systemic gaps.


1. Poor Market Forecasting


Farmers often make production decisions based on the previous year’s prices rather than data-driven projections. If plantain or rice sold well last year, many switch to it, creating oversupply the following year.2. Limited Storage and Processing


Ghana loses between 30 and 50 percent of fresh produce annually due to weak storage infrastructure. When gluts occur, these losses worsen. Without cold-chain systems or warehousing, produce floods the market at once, causing prices to fall.




3. Fragmented Value Chains


While some crops like rice require structured buyers and processors, many farming regions operate without organised market linkages. The tomato sector is especially vulnerable because of lack of processing factories after the collapse of facilities like the Pwalugu Tomato Factory.


4. Over-Reliance on Regional Imports


For tomatoes especially, overdependence on Burkina Faso and Niger exposes Ghana to external risks. A disruption there immediately destabilises supply here.


How the Glut and Scarcity Affect Farmers and Consumers


Despite bumper harvests, many farmers are struggling. Some are forced to sell below cost just to clear their fields, while others watch crops rot in the absence of proper storage. At the same time, urban consumers are paying the price, tomatoes are expensive, pushing households to rely on substitutes like tomato paste or garden-egg stews.


Traders, struggling with high spoilage rates, unstable bulk prices, and rising transport costs, pass these expenses on to shoppers. The result is a distorted market where farmers lose, and consumers don’t necessarily gain.


What Experts Say


Agricultural economists argue that Ghana’s problem is not production capacity but coordination and infrastructure. The Chief Executive Officer of Agri-Impact, Daniel Fahene Acquaye, has urged the government to adopt long-term policies rather than temporary interventions that ensure consistent support for local rice, maize, and poultry producers.


Some tomato traders say stabilising the Burkina Faso trade route is essential for short-term relief, but long-term solutions like storage and proper logistics would reduce heavy losses. Without these, they warn that even abundant.


The Way Forward: A More Balanced Food System


1. Government Purchase and Buffering of Surplus Rice


Buying locally grown for school feeding programmes, buffer stocks and institutional consumption can stabilise prices and prevent wastage. President Mahama has ordered public institutions to prioritise locally produced food to help absorb the current harvest surplus. Schools and prisons are now required to source all their food locally, and excess eggs and grains are being directed into the School Feeding Programme to support farmers and help them recover their investments.


2. Expand Irrigation and Greenhouse Cultivation for Tomatoes


Expanding irrigation in major tomato-growing zones like Akomadan, Afram Plains, Tono and Vea, remains one of the most reliable ways to secure year-round production and avoid Ghana’s recurring tomato shortages. The collapse of the Pwalugu Irrigation Project, which left farmers dependent on rainfall stands as a reminder of what happens when such investments stall.


3. Invest in Storage, Milling and Processing Facilities


Modern rice mills, cold storage facilities, and reactivation of tomato processing factories are essential to balance the market.


4. Implement a National Crop Forecasting System


A centralised agricultural data platform can guide farmers on the crops that will be profitable and prevent herd production.


5. Strengthen Regional Trade Routes


Formalising cross-border tomato trade can reduce logistics disruptions and stabilise prices for consumers.


Conclusion


Ghana’s simultaneous rice glut and tomato scarcity reveal a food system struggling with coordination, infrastructure and resilience. Farmers who should be celebrating bumper rice harvests are pleading for intervention, while consumers scrambling for basic tomato supplies are spending more than they can afford.


With deliberate planning, improved storage, strong irrigation and market intelligence, Ghana can turn this irony into balance, ensuring that abundance translates into prosperity for farmers and stable prices for consumers.

My mo Kwame Nkrumah comment was totally misunderstood  NAPO,"The running mate to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia in the 2024 election, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, says his controversial “mo Kwame Nkrumah” remark was taken out of context and completely misunderstood. 




Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Tuesday, the former Manhyia South MP insisted that the public outrage that followed the comment did not reflect his intent.


Dr Opoku Prempeh, aka NAPO, said the statement was made in a specific political moment and should not have been interpreted as an attack on Ghana’s first President. 


“At that time, you can’t go into the evidence, so I made a statement ‘mo Kwame Nkrumah’, and I subsequently had to go to Nkroful and speak to the Chiefs there and explain the contest in which the statement was made,” he said.


He explained that political communication can be easily distorted and that leaders must take responsibility when their words create confusion. 




“Because in politics, if somebody misunderstands, misquotes, or you allow your communication to be misread or to be misunderstood, you have to own it. So I owned it, and that is why I issued the statement,” he said.


Dr. Opoku Prempeh compared his remark to football banter to underscore that he was not attacking Kwame Nkrumah. 


“Not that the context was wrong. I’m a die-hard fan of Kumasi Asante Kotoko. So if I’m teasing Olympic supporters and I said ‘mo Oly fuo no’, I’m not really insulting Olympic fans. I’m just upping Kotoko fuo because I am one of them,” he explained. 





He maintained that the Nkrumah reference had been “totally misunderstood”.



The NPP running mate acknowledged the strong reaction that followed. 


“It generated a lot of uproar. Nkrumahists got furious, and I apologise to them,” he said. But he urged critics to reflect on Nkrumah’s own writings. 


“They should go and read Kwame Nkrumah’s Last Days from Guinea and look at how he described his own Convention People’s Party (CPP). He said the CPP was dead. That’s Nkrumah’s own writing, so we don’t say these things out of lack of respect. You know me. I have friends everywhere,” he noted.


Dr. Opoku Prempeh’s comment in July 2024—stating that no president, including Kwame Nkrumah, had outperformed President Akufo-Addo—triggered widespread backlash when he was unveiled as the New Patriotic Party’s running mate. 




Critics, including the Convention People’s Party, described his remark as disrespectful. The episode reignited concerns about what many opponents have called his “arrogant” public posture.


On PM Express, however, Dr Opoku Prempeh insisted that the debate was driven by misinterpretation rather than intent. 


He stressed that the statement was political rhetoric, not an attack on Ghana’s founding leader.
