Ghana is a talk show country  Bokpin,"Economist Professor Godfred Bokpin has delivered a sharp critique of public discourse that is not grounded in data.He argues that national conversations are too often driven by emotion rather than evidence, underscoring the need to prioritize data in terms of its use, accessibility and relevance to policy making.He stressed that putting data at the centre of discussions is essential for sound economic decision-making.Professor Godfred Bokpin made these remarks during a panel discussion at the 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users and Enhancers.“As an academic, I put more emphasis on data than gold because I can do without gold. Countries have managed the affairs without gold deposits. I will choose data over gold. I will choose data over oil. I will choose data over every input because without data, nothing gets done. That is how important data is,” he said.He added that the Ghana Statistical Service generates a significant amount of data that remains underutilized, calling for stronger efforts to harness it for economic planning and business decision-making.“There is so much data that is harvested in this country by the Ghana Statistical Service. Sometimes we think that Ghana Statistical Service exists only to give a GDP number. They do so much, so much. But the question is, in our daily life, how often do we rely on data? How data-driven are we? This country is a talk show country. Forgive me.”“The reason this country is a talk show country is that a lot of our discussions across the media platform is not driven by data. If we were driven by data as a country, there would be less disagreement in our discussions on media platforms, and there would be less emotion, and probably less fight. You understand that? Because the data is what it is,” Professor Bokpin remarked.He said once data is placed at the centre of national dialogue, arguments can be made dispassionately, irrespective of where one falls on the political divide, creating a healthier environment for policy making and economic reforms.“If we are doing well, the data says so, it doesn’t matter which party you belong to. So inflation has come down to 6.3%. You don’t need a prophet to tell you this is it and the implication because this is what it is. So sometimes our dogmatism and all of that is magnified because we are less driven by data. Sometimes you see people making arguments driven by emotions. The reason that is happening is because they have not looked at the data. What is the data saying? I think that we are at a point where we can elevate data in terms of its usage, accessibility, and we need to put data at the forefront of national discussion. This way, Ghana will be able to make meaningful progress,” Professor Bokpin mentioned.Tags: BokpinDataGhana News",Daniel Sackitey,,"December 9, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/ghana-is-a-talk-show-country-bokpin/
Analysts back Fitch forecast; project 3.5% policy rate cut,"Market watchers are increasingly aligning with Fitch Solutions’ projection of a sharp reduction in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at the Bank of Ghana’s next Monetary Policy Committee meeting in January 2026, forecasting a substantial 350-basis-point cut that would lower the rate from 18% to 14.5%.Their expectations follow continued improvements in key macroeconomic indicators.November inflation dropped to 6.3%, while the Ghana Reference Rate (GRR) for December stands at 15.93%. Lending rates, averaging between 21% and 22%, remain significantly above inflation, prompting calls for a decisive policy adjustment to realign the interest-rate environment with current price stability.Finance and Tax Analyst Nelson Cudjoe Kuagbedzi tells Citi Business News that the prevailing economic data provides enough room for the central bank to ease its monetary stance more aggressively.“For November, inflation was 6.3 percent, policy rate was at 18 percent, the Ghana Reference Rate is around 15.93 percent, and lending rates hover between 21 and 22 percent. Clearly, there is a huge gap between inflation and the policy rate.We expect the MPC to cut the rate by about 350 basis points to 14.50 percent. Once this happens, lending rates should decline, allowing for credit expansion to the private sector, which needs cheaper funds for growth and sustainable job creation.”Players say a steeper rate cut could stimulate borrowing, support private-sector investment, and sustain Ghana’s economic recovery momentum as inflation stabilises.Tags: FitchGhana NewsPolicy rate cut",Daniel Oduro-Mensah,,"December 9, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/analysts-back-fitch-forecast-project-3-5-policy-rate-cut/
Pressure mounts on government to direct TOR Levy Funds toward refinery revamp,"Pressure is mounting on government to channel part of proceeds from the Tema Oil Refinery Recovery Levy into retooling and supporting the refinery as plans to revive the facility gather momentum.TOR’s long-delayed turnaround has in recent months shown signs of progress after years of operating far below capacity, leaving the country reliant on imported refined products.The call underscores growing industry expectations that a successful revamp of the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) could strengthen the downstream petroleum sector.Executive Secretary of the Chamber of Petroleum Consumers, Duncan Amoah in an interview with Citi Business News said sustained investment will be critical to ensuring the refinery can operate efficiently and meet long-term market needs once it resumes full activity.“TOR would need investment. So whatever they do there today, if we don’t pump in the appropriate investment, we would simply be waiting on them to fail so that we come back to blame them. You cannot finance cargoes with TOR books currently. They are in huge deficits or debts.“We would expect that the TOR recovery levy that we have collected over the years, the finance ministry will be magnanimous to apply part of it to their operations, retool them, get them some $80 million revolving funds so that at least they are assured of bringing in at least two, three cargoes so as to sustain their operations. If we don’t give them an opportunity to finance, I mean, their refining activities, we will simply be waiting on them to do whatever they can do for two, three months and the plant will go down again and then we will spend money again to maintain and then bring it back on. I think that the finance ministry, the energy ministry should take it very seriously because we are all watching,” Duncan Amoah stated.He has also called for policy reforms that would guarantee a consistent allocation of domestically produced crude oil to the Tema Oil Refinery for processing.“You cannot continue to produce oil and then ship everything out of your country only to go and bring back refined products from Europe. It’s not good enough. So petroleum agreements, I agree. We need to be very strategic with them as a country. Don’t sign off everything because somebody is bringing in an investment and say that they do their liftings and when it’s your lifting, they also do it and bring you money when your hydrocarbons can equally be processed down here. But again, it will boil down to what kind of strategy we have for the refinery. If it is our thinking that we want the refinery to sustain itself, then we would also find the need to provide them sustainable crude cargoes so that they can at least keep in operation,” Duncan Amoah added.Tags: COPECGhana NewsTOR",Daniel Sackitey,,"December 9, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/pressure-mounts-on-government-to-direct-tor-levy-funds-toward-refinery-revamp/
Tariff hikes disrespectful and unjustified  TUC,"Dr Ken Tweneboa Kodua, Vice Chair of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), has condemned the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) for announcing electricity and water tariff increases without exhausting negotiations with organised labour.Speaking on Eyewitness News on Monday, December 8, Dr Kodua described the process as incomplete and disrespectful, revealing that the TUC had been working to establish a fair and realistic tariff structure for its members and that the decision taken by the PURC must be questioned.He further stressed that the premature announcement of tariffs undermines the collaborative efforts between PURC and TUC, noting that such unilateral decisions could erode trust and compromise future engagement between the regulatory body and organised labour.“The process and the procedure were not exhaustive. We were as a team trying to come up with a fair, realistic tariff that we could even explain to our members. That process was truncated, and this tariff was announced.“That is not respectful and not in the best interest of fairness in our partnership with PURC. PURC, in its own wisdom, started engagement processes with TUC, and why they halted and chose to announce these tariffs without exhausting the process must be answered,” he stated.In response to the announcement, organised labour has called for a suspension of the 9.86% increase in electricity tariffs and the 15.92% hike in water tariffs, scheduled to take effect from January 1, 2026.Labour also pledged to resist any tariff increase that could negate the gains from the planned 2026 wage rise unless the government adjusts the proposed 9% wage increase to offset the additional burden on workers.Tags: Ghana NewsPURCTariffTUCTweneboa Kodua",Patricia Boakye,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/tariff-hikes-disrespectful-and-unjustified-tuc/
IMANI files RTI request seeking full disclosure on SIM registration plan,"Policy think tank IMANI Africa has filed a Right to Information (RTI) request demanding full disclosure on the government’s proposed nationwide SIM registration exercise, expected to commence in early 2026.The request, submitted on Monday, December 8, 2025, to the Ministry of Communications, Digital Technology, and Innovations, seeks details on the legal framework, technical design, procurement processes, and data protection safeguards underpinning the initiative. IMANI said the request was formally received by the Minister’s secretary.In its submission, IMANI requested information on the legal instruments authorising the new SIM registration regime, the technical and biometric verification architecture to be deployed, procurement records and vendor selection processes, as well as institutional oversight arrangements.The think tank also demanded clarity on data protection and privacy safeguards for Ghanaians whose information would be captured.IMANI cited growing public concern over the cost, governance and transparency of the planned exercise, particularly regarding the involvement of private vendors and the handling of citizens’ biometric data.The RTI request invokes Article 21(1)(f) of the 1992 Constitution and the Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), which guarantees the public’s right to access information held by public institutions.According to IMANI, the request is aimed at promoting accountability and ensuring that the SIM registration exercise is conducted in the public interest, with adequate legal, technical and privacy protections in place.Click here to read the request by IMANI Africa…..Explore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!Click on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:

Telecel champions the next wave of Innovators at Tech in Ghana 2025,"The Director of External Affairs at Telecel Ghana, Komla Buami, has advocated for a new era of collaboration and investment in young innovators as the country positions itself for a digital future.Speaking at the 2025 Tech in Ghana conference on the theme: ‘When Tradition Meets Innovation’ held at the Manhyia Palace, Mr. Buami shared the telecommunications giant’s sustained investment in nurturing young talents, supporting tech startups, and championing partnerships that accelerate the growth of the country’s digital economy.Addressing an audience that included chiefs, policy makers, captains of industry, entrepreneurs and key figures in the tech ecosystem, he described Ghana’s next digital leap as contingent on bold investment in the next generation of thinkers and makers.“Connectivity alone isn’t enough. We must invest in the next wave of thinkers and innovators. We must be intentional about building a constant talent pipeline to lead the digital revolution,” he said, urging industry leaders to overcome the trap of working in silos that has often hindered collaboration in the sector.Telecel Ghana has already demonstrated this commitment through initiatives like the DigiTech Academy, which has trained about 2,000 upper primary and junior high school students across 13 regions in robotics, coding, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and digital marketing.Through DigiTech, many young graduates have been equipped to build prototypes of smart home systems, automated farm harvesters, and web applications addressing challenges such as malnutrition and mental health.“Ghana is not short of talent; we’ve simply not been asking our young people to dream big enough and not given them the tools and enabling environment to lead the digital revolution. That should change now,” Mr. Buami said.He also shared the telco’s efforts to address gender disparity in engineering through its Female Engineering Students Scholarship Programme (FESSP), which has trained more than 100 female engineers by providing mentorship, financial support, and practical work experience.Telecel has recently reinforced its commitment to digital skills development by partnering with the Ghana One Million Coders initiative, offering free access to its Startocode platform for 100,000 young people. The platform provides courses in Python, web development, data analytics, and digital entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on empowering female learners.Beyond talent development, Telecel has played a leading role in strengthening Africa’s startup ecosystem. Through the Africa Startup Initiative Programme, Telecel Group has supported more than 40 startups, provided more than $750,000 in benefits, and helped create nearly 4,000 jobs, with about 70 per cent of these startups being women-led.Mr Buami also stressed the importance of collaboration across sectors, arguing that innovation cannot happen in isolation. He urged tech founders to work with traditional industries, AI innovators, government, content creators and universities to grow the tech industry inclusively. “Innovation doesn’t happen in compartments. Across the world, collaboration is leading innovation. Open-source ecosystems are winning. Cross-sector partnerships are winning. And Ghana must win this way too,” he said.Positioning itself as a long-term partner in Ghana’s digital journey, Telecel has pledged to continue investing in connectivity infrastructure, mentoring young innovators, and supporting the broader tech ecosystem to ensure Ghana’s digital revolution is inclusive and sustainable.Tech in Ghana: Royal Edition 2025 is the 16th edition of the national tech conference, and the first ever to be held in the Ashanti Region under the patronage of Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.  The conference brought together startups, investors, government representatives, and tech enthusiasts from the diaspora to explore how sectors like agriculture, education, manufacturing and fintech are being transformed by technology.Tags: Ghana NewsTelecel",Juliana Odame Asare,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/telecel-champions-the-next-wave-of-innovators-at-tech-in-ghana-2025/
Minority slams govt over tariff hikes; demands immediate withdrawal,"The Minority in Parliament has slammed the government’s recent utility tariff increases, calling for the immediate withdrawal of what they describe as punitive and unjustified hikes that will worsen the economic conditions of Ghanaians.This comes in response to the recent announcement by the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC), which approved a 9.86 percent increase in electricity tariffs and a 15.92 percent rise in water tariffs effective January 1, 2026, as part of its multi-year review from 2026 to 2030.The Commission said the adjustments were necessary to support investment needs, account for inflation and exchange rate movements, and ensure utility providers remain competitive.But the Minority insists the government must prioritise fixing systemic inefficiencies rather than passing the cost on to consumers.They argue that recovering the millions lost annually to power losses would significantly reduce the need for tariff adjustments. The caucus maintains that Ghanaians cannot withstand further increases and that immediate reversal is the only responsible action.Addressing journalists in Accra on Monday December 8, George Kwame Aboagye, Ranking Member on the Energy Committee and MP for Asene Manso Akroso, warned that the cumulative 28.14 percent rise in electricity tariffs within a short period was unacceptable, especially at a time when the country continues to record persistent commercial and technical power losses totaling 32 percent.According to him, the government’s decision to impose fresh tariff hikes despite these inefficiencies amounts to “a direct assault on the livelihoods of ordinary Ghanaians and the survival of businesses,” stressing that the administration had chosen“ the lazy path of shifting its failures onto already suffering consumers.”Aboagye argued that the increases would erode the recently approved 9 percent weight adjustment for 2026 and push more households into what he described as “utility poverty,” leaving families unable to afford basic electricity.He cautioned that small and medium-scale enterprises, which form the backbone of the economy, would face collapse under the burden of rising operational costs.“These tariff hikes are not reforms—they are punishments,” he said. “They are not solutions. They are symptoms of failed leadership and poor policy choices. We call on the government to halt these incessant increases. The Minority stands with Ghanaian workers, households, small businesses, and industries struggling to survive. These tariff hikes must be reversed immediately.”Referring to the country’s energy performance, Aboagye questioned why large-scale losses continue despite stable demand levels.He explained that Ghana’s current peak demand of 4080 megawatts and an average demand of about 3500 megawatts highlight the scale of inefficiencies.“If you deduct 30 percent losses—12 percent technical and 20 percent commercial—you can see the magnitude of money lost. We are losing about 80 to 90 million dollars,” he noted. “Tell me, can’t we use this money to offload whatever cost or debt we have? Every time we talk about losses, but it seems nobody is taking serious account of them.

Ghanas improving macro outlook should boost all sectors  Fidelity Bank MD,"The Managing Director of Fidelity Bank Ghana, Julian Opuni, has outlined a compelling case for investment in Ghana’s rebounding economy. In an interview with the Global Investor, a premier publication distributed at high-level summits across the world, Mr. Opuni provided a detailed roadmap for investors looking to navigate Ghana’s financial landscape in 2025.With Ghana’s GDP projected to rise, Mr. Opuni emphasized that the timing is right for strategic capital deployment. “Ghana’s improving macroeconomic outlook should drive progress across sectors, fostering stronger conditions for investment and business growth,” Mr. Opuni stated in the interview.He pinpointed four critical growth engines for the coming year: SMEs, agriculture, sustainable extractives, and regional trade.Mr. Opuni highlighted the pivotal role of small businesses, noting that “SMEs form the backbone of Ghana’s economy, contributing to employment, innovation, and local value.” He detailed Fidelity Bank’s active role in this ecosystem, citing strategic investments and partnerships with the Mastercard Foundation and Proxtera.These collaborations, he explained, “have enabled better access to capital and technical support for high-potential businesses, offering scalable and diversified opportunities for investors.”On the agricultural front, Mr. Opuni was bullish on the potential of agri-processing. “We view this sector as essential to food security, job creation, and foreign exchange generation,” he said.“Agriculture, especially horticulture and agri-processing, holds major potential. Our work with FAGE, the Export Club, and initiatives like Bridge in Agric, which has disbursed over GHS 145 million, is helping to formalise and grow the sector,” he said. He noted that government programmes such as Feed Ghana are making the space more structured and attractive to investors.Addressing the rapid digitization of Ghana’s financial sector, Mr. Opuni described how Fidelity Bank is leveraging technology not just for efficiency, but for deeper inclusion.“At Fidelity Bank, digital innovation drives both internal transformation and external growth; key pillars of a future-ready institution,” he told Global Investor. “We’re using automation to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve speed,” he said.“Upgrades to our Mobile App and USSD platforms, plus innovations like Kukua, our WhatsApp banking assistant, have led to higher transaction volumes and stronger customer engagement.”He further elaborated on the bank’s collaborative approach with fintechs to solve the problem of credit access for the underserved market. “We’re also co-developing tools with fintechs that go beyond traditional banking, like cash-flow-based lending and behavioral credit scoring,” Opuni explained.“This digital ecosystem is unlocking new opportunities for embedded finance and data-driven innovation.”With global capital increasingly seeking sustainable avenues, Mr. Opuni framed Fidelity’s ESG strategy as a core business driver rather than a peripheral activity.“Fidelity’s sustainability strategy is built around three pillars: Sustainable Finance, Sustainable Operations, and CSR,” he outlined. He highlighted agriculture, renewable energy, and youth-led enterprises as high-potential segments. He then pointed to the bank’s GreenTech Innovation Challenge and the Fidelity Young Entrepreneurs initiative as a prime example of how the bank supports ventures that are “scalable and aligned with both commercial and impact investor goals.”He closed by reinforcing Fidelity Bank’s role as a long-term partner to Ghana’s growth sectors. “In all these areas, Fidelity acts not just as a financier but as a partner, connecting SMEs with advisory support, technical expertise, and blended capital,” he noted.Tags: Fidelity BankGhana NewsJulian OpuniMacroeconomic outlook",Citi Newsroom,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/ghanas-improving-macro-outlook-should-boost-all-sectors-fidelity-bank-md/
Domestic revenue mobilisation becomes priority for GRA ahead of IMF exit,"The Ghana Revenue Authority is intensifying domestic revenue mobilisation in line with measures outlined in the 2026 Budget, as Ghana prepares to transition out of its IMF programme next year.Acting Head of Strategy and Research at the Authority, Dominic Naab, noted that the GRA has rolled out a number of targeted compliance and administrative reforms which, if executed effectively, are expected to strengthen revenue performance and provide government with a more reliable stream of funds to support development priorities.He spoke to the media on the sidelines of the Media Foundation for West Africa’s Tax Dialogue.“We have instituted a lot of measures. If you look at the budget that was read for example, you have the E-VAT that is using electronic means to generate VAT invoices. That will help GRA to monitor real time what is happening. It means therefore that if we are able to do it very well, we are likely to make so much revenue. The [Finance] Minister also mentioned using artificial intelligence especially in port operations to make sure the gaps are identified and he also mentioned some mentioned some declaration defects and all those things will be corrected.“It is our hope that when these measures are put in place, we should be able to raise the revenue to help us develop our country. We are also aware there is fatigue internationally so we can’t get revenue from anywhere so we just need to generate revenue here. Truth of the matter is that there are people really making income but because they are not in our radar, we don’t get to tax them,” he said.As Ghana edges closer to the end of its IMF-supported programme, tax analysts say the effectiveness of domestic revenue measures will be crucial in determining the country’s fiscal resilience beyond 2026.Tags: Domestic Revenue MobilisationGhana NewsGRAIMF",Daniel Sackitey,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/domestic-revenue-mobilisation-becomes-priority-for-gra-ahead-of-imf-exit/
Bank of Ghana hints at rebalancing foreign reserves with partial gold divestment,"The Bank of Ghana says is undertaking a strategic rebalancing of its total foreign reserves, which includes a partial divestment of its gold holdings.The initiative forms part of the Bank’s broader strategic asset allocation framework, aimed at aligning the composition of reserves with long-term objectives as captured in the Bank’s Monetary Policy FAQs.By adjusting its exposure, the Bank seeks to reduce vulnerability to gold price volatility, thereby minimising the need for active hedging within its defined risk parameters.While the Bank maintains an informed view of global gold price trends, it stresses that its approach is not speculative.Instead, the move is a disciplined and prudent risk management strategy, ensuring that decisions on reserve composition are guided by long-term stability and financial resilience rather than short-term market fluctuations.The rebalancing could improve Ghana’s external reserve management efficiency while maintaining confidence in the country’s monetary framework, signalling a cautious but proactive stance amid global commodity price uncertainties.Tags: Bank of GhanaForeign reservesGold divestment",Nii Larte Lartey,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/bank-of-ghana-hints-at-rebalancing-foreign-reserves-with-partial-gold-divestment/
Cybele Energys Guyana oil deal opens strategic frontiers for Ghanaian investors  Commerce Chamber,"Ghanaian businesses should consider turning their attention to Guyana, now one of the world’s fastest-growing petroleum frontiers.This comes after Ghanaian-owned Cybele Energy secured a major offshore oil block that could unlock a new wave of international investment opportunities for local firms.Cybele Energy is expected to sign the Production Sharing Agreement for the shallow-water Block S7 on Tuesday December 9, 2025 positioning the company at the centre of an oil economy that has transformed almost overnight.Guyana currently produces 900,000 barrels of oil per day from four FPSOs, a figure projected to reach 1.3 million barrels per day by 2027 and 1.7 million barrels by 2030.For a country with a population just crossing one million people, the scale of production and the pace of economic expansion is unprecedented.The acquisition gives Ghana, through Cybele, a foothold in this market, creating openings for Ghanaian companies across the oil and gas value chain.From logistics, vessel supply, catering, warehousing, and crew management to engineering, pipe maintenance, and decommissioning, the opportunities are vast.President of the Ghana Chamber of Commerce in Guyana, Stanley Amartiefio Jnr, tells Citi Business News that Cybele’s entry provides a strategic springboard for Ghanaian firms eager to expand globally.According to him, the Chamber is ready to support businesses seeking entry into Guyana not just in oil and gas, but also in construction, medical services, sanitation, and other fast-growing sectors.“Once exploration begins and the vessels arrive, the opportunities are endless,” he said.“Guyana’s oil boom is creating demand across every corner of the value chain, and Ghanaian companies already have the expertise to deliver. This is the moment for them to step in.”Cybele’s move is also significant for Guyana.The signing is expected to deliver at least US$10 million in upfront bonuses and comes with stringent local-content obligations, including US$1 million annually for training Guyanese nationals over five years.Cybele will execute the block in collaboration with global engineering giants Well Expertise AS and Elemental Energies now merged into one of the world’s leading well-engineering groups with operations across four continents, and partnerships with brands such as Equinor, ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies, ENI, and Shell.Cybele CEO Beatrice Mensah Tayui describes the deal as a milestone not only for Guyana’s upstream sector but also for women-led energy enterprises globally, noting that the country’s leadership has made “a historic and bold statement” by awarding the block to a woman-owned African firm.While Guyana cements its position as the world’s newest oil superpower, its rapid economic acceleration is creating an investment climate unmatched in the region.But for Ghanaian companies, the door has opened wide and the time to step through is now.Tags: cybele energyGhana Chamber of Commerce in GuyanaGhana NewsinvestmentStanley Amartiefio Jnr",Nii Larte Lartey,,"December 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/12/cybele-energys-guyana-oil-deal-opens-strategic-frontiers-for-ghanaian-investors-commerce-chamber/
