Man who assaulted his naked wife remanded again; sister granted bail,"John Odartey Lamptey, a businessman who allegedly assaulted his naked wife at Ofankor in Accra, has been remanded for the second time by a court.
Lamptey, who first appeared before a District Court, was on December 3, 2025, brought before a Circuit Court at the Police Headquarters.
Also in the dock was his sister, Grace Lamptey, a food vendor.
John has been charged with causing harm, physical assault, two counts of threat of death, and engaging in domestic violence.
Grace, 51, faces a charge of threat of harm. Both pleaded not guilty.
While the court remanded John, it admitted Grace to bail in the sum of GHC20,000 with two sureties, and ordered her to report to the police every two weeks.
The matter was adjourned to December 16, 2025.
The prosecution opposed granting bail to John, arguing that it could compromise his personal security and allow him access to witnesses.
Defence counsel, however, said the accused persons were not flight risks, noting that police arrested them in their known homes, and insisted they would comply with any bail conditions.
The complainant, Harriet Amuzu, a 32-year-old unemployed woman, is the wife of the accused. The couple has two children.
According to the prosecution, investigations revealed that in July 2025, John attacked Harriet, physically assaulted her, inserted pepper into her vagina, and forcibly had sex with her.
He allegedly seized her phone and one of their children, forcing her to flee to relatives for safety.
On November 15, 2025, John reportedly called Harriet, saying their two-year-old child was sick and needed her care. When she returned the next evening, she found the child was not ill.
The following morning, as she attempted to pack her belongings, John allegedly seized her clothes, claiming he bought them, and tore them.
He then locked the door, stripped her naked, tore her dress and waist beads, and threatened to kill her.
You think I will let you go like that? I will kill you. I set a trap for you, and I will bury you at the cemetery behind us, he said.
Prosecution said John assaulted Harriet with an aluminium mop stick and a slipper, and later wielded a cutlass, ordering her to stretch out her hands for him to cut them off.
He allegedly continued the assault with a PVC pipe, as captured in a viral video.
Fearing for her life, Harriet escaped and went into hiding.
Grace, the second accused, allegedly confronted and threatened the witness who posted the video online, saying: I give you three days, you will die. She was subsequently arrested.
The prosecution said Harriet returned from hiding on November 20, 2025, and was medically examined and given psychological counselling.",,Crime,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Man-who-assaulted-his-naked-wife-remanded-again-sister-granted-bail-2012296
"Interior minister condemns attacks on security personnel, urges professional conduct","The Minister for Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, has cautioned citizens against attacks on security personnel and called for an immediate end to such unlawful behaviour.
He also urged security officers to discharge their duties with professionalism and in accordance with the oath they swore to protect citizens.
The Minister gave the caution on Thursday during the official commissioning and handing over of 40 special-purpose armoured vehicles, comprising 15 armoured pick-ups, 20 COBRA-3s, and five COBRA-4 high-grade armoured vehicles, to the Ghana Police Service.
President John Dramani Mahama handed over the vehicles at a ceremony at the Police Headquarters, attended by high-level dignitaries.
The Minister said any assault on a police officer was an attack on the very heart of the state, adding that such conduct would be met with a firm and decisive response under Ghanas laws.
However, he noted that the relationship between the public and the security services should be reciprocal, urging professionalism, discipline, integrity, and respect during policing at all times.
Mr Muntaka described the new fleet as a practical demonstration of the governments unwavering commitment to safeguarding the Republic.
He assured the President of the Interior Ministrys alignment with efforts to build a modern, intelligence-driven, and well-equipped internal security architecture.
The Minister said his outfit was also pursuing comprehensive reforms, including modernising training, strengthening supervision, improving welfare, expanding accommodation, and deploying advanced technology across security agencies.
He said the vehicles would be strategically deployed across the country based on intelligence and operational demand, and integrated into highway patrols, high-crime zones, rapid response units, and special operations.
The Minister issued a warning to criminal networks, saying: Your time is up. The police are prepared. The tools are ready. The intelligence is improving. We will find you, we will stop you, and you will face the full force of the law. Ghana is a peaceful nation, but we are not a defenceless one.
He urged communities to support law enforcement efforts by sharing timely information, reporting suspicious activities, and participating in community-policing initiatives.
Mr Christian Tetteh Yohuno, the Inspector-General of Police, said the Police Service had, in recent years, witnessed a rise in the risks officers faced daily, adding that the new vehicles were essential for confronting criminal threats and protecting officers.
The IGP recalled President Mahamas earlier announcement of a GH1 billion investment to retool the security services, saying the government had walked its talk by fulfilling the promise to provide armoured vehicles for police patrols.
He said the vehicles would significantly enhance officer safety, operational efficiency, and overall national security.
Mr Yohuno highlighted key breakthroughs in policing, including arrests linked to rural bank robberies, the Mpasatia Radiance filling station robbery, MoMo vendor attacks, the Wa and Bole serial murders, vehicle theft syndicates, and fake online food-delivery scams.
He said many of those operations required officers to enter dangerous environments where criminals often fired at police, resulting in casualties.
Some officers sustained severe injuries, while others had died in the
line of duty.
He noted that the vehicles would completely change the face and dynamics of police operations, enabling the launch of more robust and targeted nationwide operations aimed at dismantling criminal networks.
To those disturbing the peace of this country, we are coming for you. You can run and hide, but we will surely get you, he warned.
The IGP expressed deep gratitude to the President and government for prioritising police welfare and pledged that the vehicles would be well-maintained and strategically deployed.
He urged officers across all 25 police regions to sustain their momentum and remain committed to protecting lives and ensuring national security.
Mr Yohuno assured the public of continued safety during the Christmas season, noting that comprehensive security arrangements had been put in place before, during, and after the festivities to ensure public safety.",,Crime,  4 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Interior-minister-condemns-attacks-on-security-personnel-urges-professional-conduct-2012271

'Trial yet to commence' - Wontumis lawyer dismisses claims of 15-year jail sentence,"The lead counsel for Bernard Antwi Boasiako, commonly known as Chairman Wontumi,
Andy Kwame Appiah-Kubi
, has dismissed some media speculations that his client has been handed a 15-year jail sentence.
According to him, no such verdict exists because the criminal trial against Wontumi has not yet commenced.
While in court on November 25, 2025, Appiah-Kubi told the presiding judge that the defence had yet to receive what it considers key documents from the prosecution, materials it says are essential for preparation.
We expect supplementary disclosures including documents in the prosecutions possession that may not be tendered as evidence but are still relevant for our defence, Appiah-Kubi argued.
As a result, the case has been adjourned to December 8, 2025, giving the defence time to file a formal motion demanding full disclosure.
Meanwhile, during the last proceedings on November 27, Andy Appiah-Kubi stated that the defense team will file a motion seeking a court order to compel prosecutors to release documents they believe are crucial to their case.
Speaking to the media, Appiah Kubi explained that during the previous sitting, the prosecution had indicated an intention to file additional documents.
However, as of that day's appearance, the defence, he stated, had not been served with any such filings.
In the last sitting, there was an indication that prosecution wanted to file further documents, so we inquired whether such documents had been filed. Fortunately, we have not been served with such documents, he noted.
He added that the prosecution has since stated it does not intend to file further documents and is ready for case management.
Nonetheless, the defence maintains that certain documents, believed to be in the possession of the prosecution, are necessary for their submissions.
It is our expectation that they would file some documents that we would rely on, and such documents have not been filed. We believe such documents are within the possession of the prosecution, so we prayed the court that we will come in with a motion pleading for an order directing the prosecution to serve us the documents we need, he added.
According to Appiah-Kubi, the defence will incorporate the requested documents into their own filings once they are served.
He further argued that failure by the prosecution to provide the documents would create a presumption of non-existence, which would prevent any party from relying on them during trial.",,Crime,  4 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Trial-yet-to-commence-Wontumi-s-lawyer-dismisses-claims-of-15-year-jail-sentence-2012237

Court issues arrest warrant for new suspect in Immigration Officers murder
Speaking to the media at the court premises, a family member of the late immigration officer confirmed the judges absence and the adjournment of the case.
He expressed his frustration, stating that they had waited in court for the hearing, which eventually did not take place.
According to him, they were informed that the police and court would have to wait for advice from the Attorney General.
We have been sitting and waiting for hours but the judge was absent. The case has been adjourned to December 17 and so, we will show up on that day. We have been told that unless the Attorney General presents his recommendation before the case can proceed.
Since they have yet to receive it, the case will continue to be adjourned and the suspects remanded to prevent them from securing bail. We now await the Attorney Generals advice, he said.
Aweh and Zigah are being held for their alleged involvements in the murder of the late Stephen King Amoah.
On July 3, 2025, Amoah went missing after leaving his home to meet Aweh at Ashongman Estates.
Amoahs body was discovered days later in a drain at Abom Junction. Investigations revealed that the meeting had been arranged following WhatsApp exchanges involving images of cash, allegedly to settle a debt.
Aweh claimed he had given Amoah GH500,000 to pay off a debt and retain the balance, but inconsistencies in his account raised suspicion.
He was initially charged with kidnapping and later arrested for Amoahs murder after police found a bloodstained camouflage fabric and a fufu pestle wrapped in polythene at his residence.

Ghanaian AfCFTA staff charged with fraud for allegedly diverting GH221K to betting account,"Anthonette Ama Boakye, an Executive Assistant at the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), has appeared before Circuit Court 3 in Accra, charged with defrauding by false pretences.
Prosecutors allege she diverted over GH221,000, intended for a ticket-procurement investment, into a sports betting account.
According to a report by citinewsroom.com on November 25, 2025, Boakye was granted GH200,000 bail with three sureties after pleading not guilty. Two of the sureties must be close relatives, while one is required to justify their involvement.
The report noted that facts presented in court indicate the accused had previously been arrested in 2023 over a different fraud allegation and detained at the Legon Police Station. During that period, she reportedly met Police Officer Vincent Ariston Attipoe, a close friend of the complainant, Alfred Adu, a US-based businessman.
Prosecutors told the court that Boakye allegedly presented Officer Attipoe with an investment opportunity in a flight-ticket procurement scheme, claiming it was associated with her former employer, USAID.
Officer Attipoe is said to have passed the investment proposal to Adu, who subsequently joined a three-way call with Boakye and agreed to make the investment.
The report further noted that between April and July 2024, Adu allegedly sent GH74,837 to Officer Attipoe on Boakyes behalf, and another GH146,913 directly into her mobile money and bank accounts, totaling GH221,750.
Prosecutors said Adu received no returns and, although he requested a refund, only GH20,000 was reportedly returned.
Investigators also informed the court that an examination of Boakyes mobile money statements revealed that a large portion of the funds had been moved into a Betway account and were reportedly used for sports betting.
The case has been adjourned to January 6, 2026.

The prosecution case was that the complainant,  Imoro Alhassan, is a resident of Twifo Praso. Boateng, Ofosu and Adomako are all businessmen.
In October 2025, Ofosu approached the complainant that his boss, Adomako, had five excavators, which he was selling as scrap.

"Driver accused of GH58,000 visa fraud claims late MP John Kumah received money","A forty-four-year-old driver who is accused of defrauding a Police officer and a teacher of GH58,000 has been remanded by the Achimota Court.
Benjamin Osei Sarpong is said to have collected GH30,000 from the officer and GH28,000 from the teacher under the pretext of securing them Canadian visas but failed.
Sarpong claimed he gave the money he collected from the complainants to the late John Kumah, former Member of Parliament for Ejisu Constituency.
Charged with two counts of defrauding by false pretences, Sarpong has pleaded not guilty.
Sarpong was remanded after prosecution led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Stephen Ahiale opposed bail on the grounds that Police had warned Sarpong to appear before the court on June 19, 2025 but he failed.
According to ASP Ahiale, following Sarpongs refusal to appear in court, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.
ASP Ahiale said it has taken the Police more than five months to get the accused person to appear before the court although he had alerted all parties to appear in court.
Sarpong told the court that he was unwell and travelled to Sefwi Yamfo where he had no reception to receive or make calls. He however admitted receiving a call from the case investigator over the matter.
He told the court that he only heard about the matter four days ago and he came to court with an amount of GH10,000 to be paid to the complainants.
Sarpong told the court that on June 19, 2025, he was in court, but the court did not sit.
The trial judge, after checking the records, noted that Sarpong was not in court on June 19, 2025, although the court sat that day and issued a bench warrant.
After listening to submissions of the prosecution and the accused explanation, the court remanded Sarpong into lawful custody to reappear on December 3, 2025.
DSP Ahiale narrating the facts of the case, said the complainants, name withheld, are siblings in Accra and Kumasi respectively, while Sarpong, reside at Odorkor, Accra.
Prosecution said in October 2023, the complainants discussed their intention of traveling to Canada for a visit with a friend.
The said friend later introduced Sarpong to the complainants as someone who could help them secure Canadian visas.
After several meetings, Sarpong convinced them that he could secure the visas for them at a cost.
Based on that representation, Sarpong collected GH30,000 and GH28,000 from the complainants respectively.
Sarpong after collecting the money, failed to honour his promise and began giving the complainant numerous excuses.
The complainants reported the matter to the Police and on April 22, 2024, Sarpong was arrested.
Prosecution said during investigations, Sarpong admitted the offence but stated that he gave the money he collected to the late former MP for Ejisu Constituency with the knowledge of his wife.
Sarpong however failed to lead the Police to the late MPs wife.",,Crime, 22 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Driver-accused-of-GH-58-000-visa-fraud-claims-late-MP-John-Kumah-received-money-2010518

Police arrest 16 crime suspects in major crackdown in Tamale,"The Police Special Operations Unit has arrested 16 suspects in a major crackdown on criminal activities in Tamale following a surge in violent incidents targeting residents, students, and mobile money vendors.

According to him, the arrests form part of efforts to tackle rising cases of armed robbery, stabbings, break-ins, and drug-related offences in the Northern Regional capital.
There have been violent crimes in recent times. Weve recorded attacks on mobile money vendors, attacks on students of UDS, break-ins where laptops and belongings were taken, stabbings, and the sale of hard drugs like red and tramadol, ASP Jalil stated.
He noted that civil society groups and opinion leaders had petitioned the IGP over the escalating insecurity, which prompted the deployment of the Special Operations Unit to reinforce the Regional Police Command.
ASP Jalil said the team had been operating in the region for weeks, gathering intelligence and mapping out criminal networks.
We know where the criminals operate. We are in the Northern Region and our presence is felt, he indicated.
He warned individuals involved in criminal activities that the police would pursue them relentlessly.
We will track you down, no matter where you hide, he stressed, urging the public to support ongoing investigations.

Woman arrested for publishing fake news over alleged kidnapping claim,"A woman identified as Elizabeth Acquah has been arrested by the Western Central Regional DOVVSU Command for publishing false news.
According to the police in a statement dated November 18, 2025, the news published by the suspect generated fear and panic among the public.
Government finalises law to criminalise fake news
Providing details of the incident, the Head of the Public Affairs Unit of the Western-Central Region, Assistant Superintendent of Police Beatrice Turkson, stated that the suspect, Elizabeth, recorded a video of a couple during a dispute and circulated it online, alleging that the man had kidnapped his partner.
The Western Central Regional DOVVSU Command has arrested a suspect, Elizabeth Acquah, also known as ""Yaa Lizzy,"" for publishing false news that caused public fear and panic.
The police said that a complaint was lodged by the male victim, 22-year-old Joseph Cann, at the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit (DOVVSU) office on November 17, 2025, after the video went viral, which compromised his safety.
According to the police statement, the victim explained that he had a misunderstanding with his 20-year-old girlfriend, who is a student, while driving from Tarkwa to Bogoso.
On Monday, 17th November 2025, the victim, Joseph Cann, aged 22, reported to the DOVVSU Office that on 2nd November 2025, while driving from Tarkwa to Bogoso with his girlfriend, Felicia Ofori Atta, aged 20 and a student, a misunderstanding arose between them.

Teacher on bail over recruitment scam,"A teacher, Samuel Ofosu Amartey, has been granted GH100,000 bail with two sureties by the Amasaman Circuit Court in Accra over an alleged recruitment scam.

Two Forestry Commission officers interdicted over auction of impounded lumber,"Despite raising a record GH623,000 for the Forestry Commission within a single month, two officers in the Ahafo Region have been interdicted, an action believed to be linked to concerns that their work may expose previously under-declared revenues.
Our sources reveal that upon the appointment of Elikem Kotoko as Deputy CEO of the Forestry Commission in charge of Operations, he uncovered significant irregularities and expressed strong dissatisfaction over how the state was losing revenue through illegal lumber trade.
This position, we gathered, did not sit well with certain invisible hands. Following an intelligence-led operation across the Ahafo and Bono enclaves, the Deputy CEO confiscated several consignments of illegal lumber.
These merchants operated without the requisite permits, depriving the state of revenue, an act allegedly enabled by individuals who benefit from this illicit trade.
After the vehicles were impounded, the Deputy CEO reportedly instructed the Ahafo Timber Industry Development Division TIDD office to initiate the necessary court processes to obtain authorisation to auction the seized lumber and deposit the proceeds into the Forestry Commissions bank account.
The TIDD team in Ahafo obtained the required court approval, auctioned the confiscated lumber, and deposited an impressive GH623,000 into the Commissions account.
This amount is more than 150 percent of the previous months deposits by operations of the National Monitoring Team.
This raised serious questions about whether the National Monitoring Team was failing to impound illegal lumber or underdeclaring the revenue generated.
Unexpectedly, individuals said to be benefiting from the underdeclared auctions mounted strong resistance, as the Deputy CEOs directives threatened their illicit operations.
Although reports show that the interdicted officers, Felix Gatiba and Eric Boamah, acted strictly on the instructions of the Deputy CEO, reports indicate that the HR Director issued interdiction letters to the officers, claiming he was acting on directives from the Chief Executive, Dr Hugh Brown and the Executive Director of TIDD, Dr Richard Gyimah.
A six-member committee was immediately constituted to investigate the matter.
While these officers successfully discharged their duties and generated significant revenue for the Commission and the state, their interdiction raises serious questions.
As part of the sanctions, they will forfeit 50 percent of their salaries during the investigation.
Some insiders within the Commission doubt whether the committee will thoroughly review all aspects of the operation, including the seizure of the lumber, the auction procedures, and the payment of the GH623,000.
This development underscores the critical need for a forensic audit within the Forestry Commission to unravel these invisible hands. It also raises concerns about how staff who diligently perform their duties are treated.
The outcome of the investigation will be crucial in determining whether due process was followed and why officers who generated substantial revenue for the state are facing disciplinary action.", Emmanuel Osei Kwadwo,Crime, 18 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Two-Forestry-Commission-officers-interdicted-over-auction-of-impounded-lumber-2010002

In a Facebook update on November 17, 2025, the Service said its officers, with key support from members of the White Chapel Youth Group in Madina, managed to arrest the suspect.
It added that the suspect is currently in police custody and assisting with investigations.
The arrest comes after a violent incident on November 14, 2025, when firefighters from Legon, Madina, Adenta and the National Headquarters responded to a late-night fire that destroyed seven rooms in a two-storey, eight-room building near Ability Square in Adjiringanor.

In its statement, the GNFS praised community members who helped, saying:
The Ghana National Fire Service commends the White Chapel Youth Group at Madina for their swift action in helping the Fire Officers to apprehend the suspect, as well as all individuals who provided crucial information leading to his arrest. We say ayekoo to you all.

Nurse granted GH100k bail for defrauding colleague,"A 35-year-old nurse has been granted GH100,000.00 bail with two sureties by the Asante Akropong District Court in the Atwima Nwabiagya North District for defrauding her colleague at Tafo in Kumasi.
Esther Asamoah Dufie pleaded not guilty to the charge of defrauding by false pretence and will reappear before the court, presided over by Emmanuel Wiafe Adu, on November 27, 2025.
Police Detective Inspector Alexander Agbekpornu, presenting the facts of the case to the court, said the complainant, Ruth Afia Antwiwaa, and Dufie were colleagues in the same health facility and resided at Tafo and Ohwimase respectively.
He said that in January 2025, Dufie advertised a travelling opportunity for people who were interested in travelling to the United Kingdom (UK) on her WhatsApp status, and the complainant saw it and showed interest.
The complainant therefore contacted the accused person, and she told her that the slot was from her brother, who is a military officer in the United Kingdom.
According to the prosecution, the complainant also informed her friends husband about the travelling opportunity, and he also showed interest. They paid an amount of GH54,090.00 into a CalBank account number that the accused person provided.
After the payment, the accused person promised to bring the dependent from the UK in April 2025 for the visa process but failed, so the complainant demanded a refund of the money.
The prosecution explained that all efforts to retrieve the money proved futile, so on September 16, 2025, the complainant reported the matter to the Abuakwa Police, and Dufie was arrested.
In her caution statement, Dufie admitted and pleaded for time to refund the money by October 10, 2025, and was granted police enquiry bail, but she jumped bail and went into hiding until October 27, when she was rearrested at Tafo.
After further investigations, she was charged and brought before the court.",,Crime, 17 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/crime/Nurse-granted-GH-100k-bail-for-defrauding-colleague-2009882

Ransford Owusu Ansah's Death: Facts emerging about coach Ibrahim Anyass,"Until recently, Ibrahim Anyass was known simply as a youth football coach helping young boys chase their dreams at the Siano Football Academy in Amasaman, Accra.
Today, he stands accused of shattering those very dreams, allegedly preying on one of his players, 16-year-old Ransford Owusu Ansah, whose death in March 2025 sparked nationwide outrage.
Very little is publicly known about Anyass, the man at the centre of one of Ghanas most disturbing football scandals. Anyass, believed to be in his late thirties, is the head coach of Siano Football Academy.
This small community-based setup drew dozens of young boys with dreams of becoming professional footballers.
10 Ghanaian-born players who have switched to play for other countries
For many parents, Siano was seen as a chance to give their children a future through football.
But behind the hopeful smiles and training sessions, disturbing allegations have emerged that Anyass sexually abused some of the boys under his care, including 16-year-old Ransford Owusu Ansah, who tragically died in March 2025 after reportedly enduring years of abuse.
While Anyass kept a relatively low public profile, a few videos circulating online show him in casual moments with the children, sometimes in rooms where they appear to be asleep, or on the training grounds where he led practice drills.
These clips, once harmless to viewers, have now taken on a chilling new context as investigators and the public question what really went on behind closed doors at the academy.
Anyass has yet to publicly respond to the allegations. The closest he came was during a reported phone call on a television programme, where he promised to share his side of the story, a promise he never fulfilled.
He has, however, been summoned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to respond to the accusations following widespread outrage and a growing online campaign under the hashtag #JusticeForRansford.
Allegedly this is the face of the Coach Ibrahim who d Ransford to his death. And he Dey camp other kiddies too dem for arrest am cus I feel hes not done.

November 20 set for hearing in malicious prosecution case against police officers,"A motion on notice has been filed to set down for hearing the case involving two
Ghana Police Service
officers accused of malicious prosecution by the leader of the Alliance for the Restoration of Civil Rights (ARCR), William Kofi Yirenkyi.
The case has been scheduled for hearing on November 20, 2025, at the Accra High Court (General Jurisdiction).
In a Facebook post dated November 5, 2025, Yirenkyi disclosed that the
Ghana Police Service
had failed to file a defence or enter an appearance in the civil suit, nearly three months after being served.
Describing the silence as a disregard for due process, he said he had instructed his lawyers to proceed by filing a motion on notice to set the case down for hearing.
He cited the Supreme Court decision in In Re Nungua Chieftaincy Affairs, Nii Odai Ayiku IV v. Attorney-General and Wor-Nii Bortei Bortelabi [2010] SCGLR 413, which allows for such motions when defendants fail to respond within the required time frame.
The landmark malicious prosecution suit was originally filed on May 26, 2025, at the High Court of Justice in Accra.
The defendants, Detective Corporal (D/C) Inspector Mathias Awudi and D/C Inspector Richard Ackumey, both attached to the Accra Regional Police Command, are accused of wrongful arrest, unlawful detention and initiating a baseless prosecution against Yirenkyi.
According to court documents, the dispute stems from December 30, 2023, when Yirenkyi reported an assault case at the Cantonments Police Station.
Dissatisfied with the pace of investigations, he escalated the matter to the Greater Accra Regional Police Commander in January 2024, leading to its reassignment to D/C Inspector Awudi.
However, after nearly eleven months of what Yirenkyi described as no tangible progress, tensions escalated on November 13, 2024, when he inquired about the case status.
He alleges that Awudi reacted angrily and had him arrested and detained for three days without cause.
William Yirenkyi drags two police officers to court over alleged malicious prosecution
Two days later, on November 15, 2024, he was arraigned before the Gbese District Court on charges of disturbing the peace in a public place under Section 298 of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29).
The prosecution, led by D/C Inspector Ackumey, reportedly failed to provide credible evidence, leading to Yirenkyis discharge by the court for lack of reasonable and probable cause.
Yirenkyi contends that the officers actions were driven by personal vendetta and intended to retaliate against his persistence in seeking justice.
He is seeking, A declaration of malicious prosecution, Special damages totaling GH40,000, covering legal fees (GH20,000) and lost income during detention, General damages, Costs and any further relief deemed appropriate by the court.
The writ of summons was issued by his lawyer, Martin L. Kpebu of Black Star Legal Services and served on the defendants with a directive to respond within eight days or risk judgment by default at the time.
The case will be heard on November 20, 2025, at the Accra High Court (General Jurisdiction).

Mavis Hawa Koomson
, says she feels vindicated by the report of the Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed Mubarak, on the 2024 Kasoa shooting incident, which attributed the violence to security lapses and institutional failures rather than any individuals actions.
In a statement on Thursday, November 6, 2025, Hawa Koomson said the findings confirm what she had always maintained  that she was wrongly accused and unfairly targeted by the public and sections of the media.
The Ministers report confirms that 21 suspects have been identified, that there were clear breaches of discipline by some security officers, and that the use of firearms in certain situations was unjustified, she stated.
These findings affirm what I have consistently maintained, that the Kasoa incident was the result of security lapses and institutional failures, not the actions or instigation of any individual.
She lamented the years of vilification and what she described as harsh and unfair public attacks that branded her violent and unfit for office.
For years, I endured harsh and unfair public attacks. I was branded violent, reckless, and unfit for office through sensational and misleading headlines. The judgment was swift and painful. Today, the Interior Ministers findings have vindicated me, she said.
The former minister also recalled being assaulted during the rerun of polling stations in Ablekuma North, an incident she described as one of the darkest moments of her public life.
Hawa Koomson expressed sympathy for victims of electoral violence and endorsed the Interior Ministers recommendations for reforms in election security management.
She appealed to the public and political actors to avoid misinformation and divisive rhetoric, calling instead for unity and reflection.
