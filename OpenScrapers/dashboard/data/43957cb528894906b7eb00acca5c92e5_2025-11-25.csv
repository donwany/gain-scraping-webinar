"Over 19,000 people living with HIV in Bono Region as new infections surge - GAC","Over 19,000 persons in the Bono Region are living with HIV and AIDS, according to the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Technical Coordinator of the Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC), Ahmed Ibrahim Bambila.
According to him, the region also recorded 875 new HIV infections.
He described the figures as alarming, urging stronger, coordinated interventions to tackle the underlying causes to prevent further spread.
Bambila spoke during the inauguration of the Bono Regional Committee of the Ghana AIDS Commission (RECCOM) in Sunyani on Thursday, November 20, 2025.
The newly inaugurated 9-member committee, chaired by Bono Regional Minister Joseph Addae Akwaboa, is expected to lead and coordinate HIV-related programmes in the region to curb infections and enhance care.
Bambila noted that several factors continued to drive HIV transmission in the region, including low condom use, multiple sexual partners, stigma and discrimination, inadequate sexual health education, migration, transactional sex, and limited access to HIV services.
According to the 2024 Regional HIV Estimates, the Bono Regions HIV prevalence stood at 2.22 percent among persons aged 15 to 49, higher than the national average.
Bambila urged community actors, health institutions, civil society groups, and traditional authorities to intensify education and advocacy to reduce stigma, promote safe sexual practices, and improve access to testing and treatment.",,Health, 22 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Over-19-000-people-living-with-HIV-in-Bono-Region-as-new-infections-surge-GAC-2010517
'Collect receipts to close revenue gaps - Chief Accountant,"Richlove Wiafe Duffour, Chief Accountant at the Mental Health Authority, has urged taxpayers to demand and collect receipts to tackle the loopholes in the nations revenue generation.
We are all contributing to the loopholes, she stated, saying collecting receipts on taxes, fees and tolls would greatly bring the situation under control, and thereby strengthen public revenue collection.
Duffour gave the advice when she spoke on training on financial management in Accra on Thursday, as part of a three-day conference of the Agency, underway in Accra.
The conference has brought together regional managers to review coverage outputs, examine thematic reporting and discuss operational challenges affecting newsgathering and dissemination.
It further sought to assess the Agencys performance over the past year, and develop strategies to strengthen its operations for 2026 and beyond.
Mrs Duffour insisted that failure to demand or collect receipts on taxes, fees and tolls paid for public services was an inappropriate practice that partly fueled corruption, affecting the nations revenue mobilization.
She cited that: You remember at the time we were paying the road tolls, some of us will not even border to collect receipts when we pay the tolls. So, you see we are our own problems.
Duffour entreated the Agency managers to endeavour to adhere to the Public Financial Management Act whenever they spend public resources in order not to find themselves in trouble.
She took the participants through the GIFMIS modules and expenditure process, and asked the Agency to avoid the temptation of borrowing without the warrant to do so, and also endeavour to keep records and retire their imprest on time.",,Health, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Collect-receipts-to-close-revenue-gaps-Chief-Accountant-2010471
Yalwa youth hold health walk to raise awareness on substance abuse,"Hajia Aisha Community Service (HACS), in partnership with Yalwa Youth, on November 16, 2025, organised a community-wide health walk aimed at campaigning against substance abuse. The event took place in Yalwa, a suburb of Abossey Okai in the Greater Accra Region.
The walk formed part of activities marking this years Maulid (the birth of Prophet Muhammad) celebration and was held under the auspices of the Abossey Okai Zongo Yalwa Chief, Sarki Mohammed Aliyu Atiku Bashar, the Mukhtar Adam Foundation, and the Hajia Aisha Community Centre.
Held on the theme Safeguarding the Future of Our Youth, the health walk brought together residents of Yelwa and surrounding communities.
The initiative sought to educate the public on the dangers of drug and substance abuse, particularly among young people.
Officials from the Greater Accra Narcotics Control Commission (NCC) and mental health professionals also participated, engaging residents on the impacts of drug misuse and mental health issues.
Speaking after the walk, Abdul Aziz Ali, Acting Deputy Regional Commander of the NCC, urged community members to view the fight against substance abuse as a collective responsibility.
He noted that many people downplay the importance of the fight because they believe they are not directly affected.
However, he stressed that substance abuse influences communities through increased crime, theft, and the likelihood of more youth being drawn into drug use.
Aziz warned that anyone found in possession of illegal substances risks a fine of GH5,000, a six-month prison term, or both.
He also cautioned against the misuse of everyday medicines such as paracetamol and doctor-prescribed drugs, describing it as an overlooked form of drug abuse.
He encouraged residents to follow medical instructions strictly and avoid self-prescribing or recommending drugs to others.
A Senior Nursing Officer at the Pantang Hospital, Zuneru Zakari, advised parents to monitor their children closely and seek medical help immediately when they notice behavioural changes.
He highlighted the psychological effects associated with substance use and stressed the need for early intervention.
The Gimbiya of Yalwa, Hajia Aisha Zakaria, called on Zongo youth across the country to avoid drug abuse and focus on activities that promote development within their communities.
She described the rising cases of substance abuse among Zongo youth as a national crisis threatening Ghanas human capital development.
She expressed concern that many promising young people with great potential are being lost to drug addiction.
Hajia Aisha also condemned the involvement of some women in drug peddling and urged them to desist from the practice for the sake of their families and communities.", Muhammed Faisal Mustapha,Health, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Yalwa-youth-hold-health-walk-to-raise-awareness-on-substance-abuse-2010431
No Ghanaian medical data stored outside the country - Lightwave tells health minister,"Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions Limited has rejected what it describes as false and misleading claims made by the Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, regarding the management of Ghanas National E-Healthcare Programme and the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS).
According to a report by peacefmonline.com, Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions made the remarks in a statement released in Accra.
The fully Ghanaian-owned technology firm stated that the Ministers recent comments made in Parliament on October 28, 2025, and later at the Presidential Accountability Series on October 29 suggesting that Ghanas medical data was controlled from India, were not just incorrect but could harm public confidence in the country's digital health achievements.
Lightwave stressed that all healthcare data generated through LHIMS is stored on the Ministry of Healths own servers at its headquarters in Accra.
The company clarified that its role is limited to providing licensed software for data management, while the government retains full ownership and control of all records.
The healthcare data of Ghanaians is the property of the Government of Ghana and is stored within the Ministry of Healths servers in Accra, the statement said, calling the Ministers remarks false and unfortunate.
The company felt it necessary to respond publicly to stop misinformation from damaging trust in a system that has been developed and implemented since 2016.
Project history and contract structure
Lightwave detailed the projects history, starting with Phase One in 2016 under the then  former President
John Dramani Mahama
, which cost US$6 million and connected 23 health facilities in the Central Region.
Lightwave Contract Saga: Okoe Boye challenges Mintah Akandoh over fine details
Following this success, the Ministry of Health signed a second contract in March 2019 valued at US$100 million to expand the system to 950 facilities across the country.
The company explained that the contract price was not spread evenly across all facilities but weighted based on the complexity of each type of institution.
Teaching and regional hospitals required much larger investments, while health centers needed less infrastructure.
Lightwave E-Healthcare dismisses health minister's claims over National E-Health project
For instance, the four teaching hospitals alone accounted for 21 percent of the contract cost, while all 646 health centers together made up only 17 percent.
By December 2024, Lightwave had installed systems in all four teaching hospitals, six regional hospitals, and 243 district and other hospitals totaling 72 percent of the contract value and justifying the US$77 million (77 percent) disbursed by the Ministry.
Lightwave attributed project delays to constant payment delays and administrative hurdles. While payments were supposed to be made within 36 days of invoice submission, the company often waited between five and twenty months, creating significant financial pressure.
COVID-19 further affected rollout plans. Training sessions had to be reduced, facility space was limited, and global supply chain issues led to unpredictable delays in equipment delivery.
Ghanas temporary port closures added to the delays. Although the Ghana Health Service provided a prioritized facility list in 2023, Lightwave noted that a 12-month contract extension was delayed for nearly six months because the revised rollout list was not sent out on time.
Financial and equipment issues addressed
Despite these challenges, the company continued to provide support services even after the contract officially expired on December 31, 2024, without renewal and without payment for additional work done throughout 2025. Lightwave also rejected claims that it supplied poor-quality or insufficient hardware.
The company stated that all equipment met or exceeded contractual standards, and any changes were approved under the contracts substantial equivalence clause.
No facility or the Ministry reported issues with the hardware
In response to a claim about laptop shortages, Lightwave clarified that the contract required 9,544 laptops, not 13,172 and that 7,060 had already been delivered, with the rest set for facilities yet to be rolled out.
The company also referenced a meeting in September 2025 where the Minister instructed Lightwave to submit invoices for eight months of outstanding payments contradicting his public statement that there were no arrears.
Legal steps and call for objective review
Through its solicitors, Messrs Lord and Lords Legal Practice, Lightwave has requested arbitration and copies of all investigation reports related to the LHIMS project.
The company believes this is essential for protecting patient data and ensuring the continuity of e-health services across the country.
Reaffirming its commitment to Ghanas digital health transformation, Lightwave called for a fair, evidence-based review of the National E-Healthcare Programme one free from political rhetoric and data misinterpretation.

"Safe Water Network Ghana marks World Toilet Day 2025, calls for stronger action on sanitation","Safe Water Network Ghana (SWN) has joined the global community to commemorate World Toilet Day 2025, calling for renewed commitment to expand access to safe toilets and improve sanitation nationwide.
This years observance, marked on November 19, 2025, under the theme Well Always Need the Toilet, highlights the critical need to protect and invest in sanitation systems as communities face increasing pressure from population growth, infrastructure gaps, and climate change.
In a statement, SWN underscored that sanitation remains an essential human need and not a privilege. Despite progress made over the years, many households and institutions across the country continue to struggle with access to clean and reliable sanitation services, largely due to limited water supply.
Through its work to expand safe, affordable, and reliable water services, SWN is helping to bridge the sanitation gap, particularly in underserved communities.
The organization has so far extended piped water connections to more than 15,000 households, schools, clinics, and small businesses across Ghana, reaching over 600,000 people.
These improved water systems are enabling communities to maintain cleaner environments, strengthen public health, and build resilience against climate-related challenges.
Safe water and sanitation are inseparable. Every piped connection we deliver brings us closer to a future where every household and institution can maintain clean, dignified, and sustainable sanitation, said Charles Nimako, Country Director of Safe Water Network Ghana.
As part of World Toilet Day 2025, SWN reaffirmed its commitment to working closely with government, private-sector partners, and local communities to accelerate national efforts toward universal access to safe water and sanitation.
The organisation also expressed appreciation to its partnersthe Government of Ghana, Stone Family Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, One Foundation, Helmsley Charitable Trust, and Uptime Globalfor their continued support in driving progress toward improved water and sanitation outcomes.

Here is the percentage of adult Ghanaians who cannot afford healthy meals,"Professor Anna Lartey, a nutrition expert at the University of Ghana, has disclosed that up to 65 percent of adult Ghanaians cannot afford healthy meals.
According to a report by graphic.com.gh. Prof Anna Lartey made this known at a recent sensitisation workshop in Accra titled Beyond the Dialogues: Tracking Ghanas Commitments to Transform Its Food Systems.
""Up to 65 per cent of adult Ghanaians are unable to afford a healthy diet daily. The recommended healthy diets consist of half a plate of vegetables and fruit, a quarter of a plate of carbohydrates, and another quarter of protein,"" she noted.

Prof Lartey said healthy foods are often more expensive than junk foods, which drives many people to choose the latter.
She pointed out that fruits and vegetables cost significantly more than sugar-laced drinks and fast foods, which are widely available on almost every street corner.
She warned that such unhealthy eating habits have serious consequences, citing them as major contributors to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and other health issues in Ghana.
According to Prof Lartey, who also serves as Project Co-Principal Investigator, the food environment heavily influences food choices, and the current environment does not support healthy options.

"Here's why vapes, ecigarettes, shisha are deadlier and illegal in Ghana","What many young people see as a trendy, portable, and safer alternative to smoking is, in reality, far more dangerous.
Across Accra and other cities, vaping and shisha lounges are becoming popular spots, especially among the youth.
Older users too are increasingly turning to ecigarettes and vapes, believing them to be a stylish, less harmful substitute for traditional cigarettes.
But the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) says this perception is dangerously wrong.
Jemima Odonko, Head of the Tobacco Products Department at the FDA, has categorically stated that ecigarettes, vapes, and shisha are illegal in Ghana.
Speaking to
GhanaWeb
during a oneday training on Illicit Financial Flows organised by the Financial Intelligence Centre in Accra, she explained that these devices are made from synthetically produced nicotine rather than natural tobacco, making them unregulated and unsafe.
More young women in Ghana smoke shisha than their male counterparts  Survey
These vapes and ecigarettes are illicit products. They are not allowed under our laws, she stressed.
Beyond their illegality, the health risks are staggering.
Studies show that vaping increases the risk of lung injury, heart disease, and nicotine addiction, with evidence linking it to longterm respiratory problems.
Ordinary tobacco already contains more than 7,000 toxic chemicals, including 70 known carcinogens that directly cause cancer.
Shisha, on the other hand, which has become a social trend among Ghanas youth, is even more alarming and research reveals that smoking shisha for just one hour is equivalent to smoking 200 sticks of cigarettes.
A 2024 nationwide study found that 44 percent of young women smokers aged 1829 actively engage in shisha, compared to just 6.6 percent of men.
Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that tobacco use kills over 8 million people every year, including 1.3 million nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.
The FDA insists that no tobacco or nicotine product can be sold in Ghana without regulatory approval, which ensures health warnings and safety requirements are displayed.
Odonko urged the public, especially young people, to resist the lure of vapes and shisha.
Protect your health, protect your future. These products are not only illegal, they are deadly, she said.

The Minister further noted that the Centre for Plant Medicine Research validated the long-term efficacy of four herbal medicines, reinforcing Ghanas leadership in traditional medicine research.
Public health surveillance remained active, successfully containing outbreaks of Mpox, meningitis, and cholera. Reconstruction of the La General Hospital is 33 percent complete, with additional work underway on hospitals in Juaboso and Sandema, as well as five CHPS compounds. The Kpone Municipal Hospital and the KOFIH Centre were commissioned in 2025.
Looking ahead, Dr Forson stated, In 2026, Government will continue rebuilding the La General Hospital, establish six regional hospitals, expand CHPS compounds, and modernise medical equipment nationwide. He added that nursing allowances had been fully paid, 13,500 nurses placed on payroll, and admission fees for trainee nurses halved.
Health training institutions expanded programmes, adding 930 new residents, 2,104 specialist nurses, and several newly accredited teaching centres. Regulatory agencies such as the Pharmacy Council and HeFRA advanced digital integration, while SafeCare accreditation increased to 34 facilities. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) also identified 232 unlicensed mortuaries, issued provisional licences, and trained 800 attendants in safe practices.
The Minister concluded that in 2026, the Ministry will advance the Free Primary Health Care agenda, scale up local manufacturing, and modernise digital claims and fraud detection systems to improve efficiency and accountability.

Ghana Library Board partners Sanitopia CIC to build 157 modern sanitation facilities,"The Ghana Library Board (GhLB) has partnered with UK-based social enterprise Sanitopia CIC to construct 157 modern sanitation facilities across libraries in Ghana, a transformative step aimed at improving hygiene, health, and access to quality education.
The collaboration aligns with Ghanas commitment to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 4 (Quality Education).
According to lawyer Nana Yaa Owusu Aduome, a trustee of Sanitopia CIC, the partnership is not just about infrastructure but about empowering children and communities with safe, clean learning spaces.
This initiative is about giving our children the safe, clean environment they need to learn, grow, and thrive without fear of disease or discomfort, she said.
She emphasised that access to proper sanitation is a matter of dignity, especially for young girls, and plays a crucial role in keeping children in school.
No child should have to choose between education and dignity. By joining hands with the Ghana Library Board, we are not just building toilets; we are building the future of Ghana, she added.
At the launch event, Alhassan Ziblim Betintiche, Director-General of the Ghana Library Authority, described libraries as living community hubs that must offer more than just books, they must also provide safe and healthy spaces for learning. Access to information, literacy, and a conducive learning environment are fundamental rights every Ghanaian deserves, he said.
Betintiche highlighted several initiatives by the Authority to make learning accessible to all, including the Ghana Library App, a zero-rated app available on MTN and Telecel that allows free access to e-books and learning materials; an expanded network of 139 public libraries across the country; and extended opening hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in selected libraries to support learners and families.
We are deeply grateful to Sanitopia CIC for this partnership, which aligns with our vision to build libraries that not only promote literacy but also safeguard health and dignity, he noted.
The Chairman and President of Sanitopia CIC, Richard Kojo Acheampong, Esq., described the partnership as a historic step toward addressing sanitation challenges in educational environments nationwide.
Under the partnership agreement, Sanitopia CIC will construct 150 sanitation facilities for existing public libraries and 150 new library facilities as part of a larger plan to build 2,000 toilets across Ghana within five years.
This project is not merely about infrastructure; its about health, dignity, and education, Acheampong said.
He explained that access to sanitation contributes to multiple Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by reducing preventable diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrhea, and SDG 5 (Gender Equality) by providing safe and private sanitation facilities for women and girls.
Sanitopia CIC also aims to; Build community-centered sanitation facilities that are affordable, safe, and sustainable; Convert waste into biogas and fertilizer, promoting environmental and economic benefits; and Train schools and communities to maintain and manage the facilities effectively.
The initiative highlights the critical link between education and public health. Organisers believe that no learning environment can thrive without proper hygiene.
Knowledge is power, Sanitopia CIC noted in a statement, but it cannot flourish if children are falling ill from preventable diseases caused by poor sanitation. Health and learning must go hand in hand.
When completed, the 157 sanitation facilities will serve as a national symbol of Ghanas progress toward a cleaner, healthier, and more inclusive society. The project also focuses on maintenance and hygiene education, ensuring that children and community members learn to sustain the facilities responsibly.
Sanitation is not just about construction; its about maintenance, responsibility, and behaviour change. We must educate as we build, said Nana Yaa Owusu Aduome.
Acheampong expressed appreciation to the Ghana Library Board, Khoshakis Ltd, Guarding Professionals Ltd, and the trustees of Sanitopia CIC for their partnership.
He also called on government agencies, corporate bodies, NGOs, and philanthropists, both in Ghana and abroad, to join the mission.
Great things happen when people come together for a cause greater than themselves. Together, we can build a Ghana where every child has access to clean sanitation, where dignity is restored, and where every library becomes a beacon of health and knowledge, he said.
Both institutions reaffirmed their shared commitment to promoting literacy, protecting public health, and fostering community development through collaboration and innovation.

Diabetes on the Rise in Ghana: Expert calls for lifestyle changes,"A public health physician at the 37 Military Hospital, Dr Ewura Adjoa Animah Ninoo, has raised concerns over the rising number of diabetes cases in Ghana.
According to a report by gbcghanaonline.com on November 13, 2025, Dr Ninoo said the condition has become one of the fastest-growing health issues in the country, driven largely by changing lifestyles and poor dietary habits among both young and older Ghanaians.
Currently, the prevalence of diabetes in Ghana is about seven to eight percent, but it keeps increasing by the day. This is why platforms like this are so important to create awareness and encourage lifestyle changes, she stated.
Experts warn of rising type 2 diabetes cases among Ghanaian children
Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the body either fails to produce insulin or cannot properly use the insulin it produces.
Insulin is a hormone that helps transfer glucose from the blood into cells to provide energy.
When insulin is ineffective, blood sugar levels rise while the body is starved of energy.
Dr Ninoo explained that there are two main types of diabetes: Type 1, which is mostly genetic and affects younger people, and Type 2, often caused by unhealthy lifestyles such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity.
Type 1 diabetes is usually found among younger people and is genetic. Type 2, on the other hand, is common in adults, especially those in their 30s and 40s, and is often linked to lifestyle choices, she said.
The physician emphasised that diabetes is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured but can be managed with medication, healthy eating, and regular medical checkups.
She warned that stopping treatment can lead to serious complications, including kidney failure, liver problems, and amputations.
Treatment depends on the type of diabetes. Type 1 patients rely on insulin injections, while Type 2 patients are usually managed with oral medication, though some may require insulin in severe cases.
Ghana observes World Diabetes Day
Dr Ninoo also urged families to support diabetic relatives emotionally and physically, noting that managing the condition requires discipline and encouragement.
She advised Ghanaians to check their blood sugar regularly, eat balanced meals, exercise often, and avoid self-medication. Early detection, she said, can save lives.

Western Regional Minister inaugurates 9-member committee to strengthen HIV/AIDS fight,"Western Regional Minister, Joseph Nelson, on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, inaugurated a nine-member Regional Committee of the Ghana AIDS Commission (ReCCOM) to intensify efforts against the spread of HIV in the region.
The committee, established under Section 9 (2) of Act 938, will initially focus on reviewing comprehensive regional data to fully understand the scope of the ongoing fight against HIV.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Nelson emphasised the urgency of the matter, noting, The most significant asset of our region our human resources, which are essential for driving our industries, supporting our communities, and sustaining our families faces a profound threat. If we do not take decisive action now, this crisis will only deepen, particularly in light of the diminishing donor support that we currently experience.
He further stated, To confront this urgent issue, I am pleased to announce the establishment of the nine-member Regional Committee of the Ghana AIDS Commission (ReCCOM). The committee's first task will be to meticulously review our regional data to ensure we grasp the full extent of the challenges that lie ahead. The mandate before us is unequivocal: we must intensify our efforts, mobilize our resources, and reinvigorate our focus on prevention strategies.
Nelson called on all stakeholders including government agencies, civil society organizations, traditional leaders, the media, and the private sector to work collaboratively on this initiative.
We must unite to halt new infections, eliminate the stigma associated with HIV, and strengthen our systems for prevention, treatment, and care. Together, we can make a substantial impact in the fight against HIV/AIDS within our region, he indicated.
The latest data released by the Ghana AIDS Commission for 2024 paints a concerning picture of HIV in the Western Region, with 1,120 new infections recorded over the year.
This figure translates to an average of three new infections per day a rate that has remained largely unchanged over the past five years.

Rh null: The rarest blood type in the world,"Blood transfusions are a cornerstone of modern medicine, saving lives during surgeries and emergencies. But for people with extremely rare blood types, finding a compatible donor can be a matter of life and death.
One of the rarest blood types is Rh null, sometimes called golden blood'.
According to a report by meterotvonline.com on November 13, 2025, only about 50 people in the world are known to have it. Because of its rarity, people with Rh null blood are often advised to store their own blood for emergencies.
Professor Ash Toye from the University of Bristol said the blood type is also highly valuable for science and medical research.
Sickle Cell Disease: The silent killer
Blood types are determined by antigen markers on red blood cells that act like ID tags.
If a patient receives blood with antigens their body doesn't recognise, their immune system may attack it.
The main blood group systems are ABO and Rhesus (Rh). While O-negative is often considered a universal donor type, over 47 blood group systems and 366 known antigens exist, meaning reactions can still occur.
People with Rh null blood have none of the 50 Rh antigens, allowing their blood to safely match with almost any Rh type.
However, they can only receive Rh null blood themselves, which is extremely difficult to find.
""Donated blood will always be essential. But for people with rare blood, being able to grow more of their own blood would be life-changing,"" the report said.
Researchers are exploring gene-editing technologies such as CRISPR to create lab-grown Rh null or other universal blood types.
Scientists in the UK, US, Canada, and Spain have made progress by editing blood stem cells to remove antigen-producing genes, while the technology is promising, producing red blood cells outside the body remains challenging, as bone marrow provides complex signals needed for proper cell development.
15k Ghanaian babies born with sickle cell disease annually  Expert
For now, individuals with rare blood types depend on blood banks and research projects to collect and store their blood for emergencies.
Experts say lab-grown blood could one day provide a reliable solution for patients with rare blood types and improve emergency transfusions worldwide.

VAST advocates health taxes and accountability,"The Executive Director of Vision for Accelerated Sustainable Development (VAST-Ghana), a civil society organisation, Labram Musah, has called on the government, through the Ministry of Finance, to review upwards the excise tax rates on unhealthy products such as tobacco, alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), ultra-processed foods (UPFs), and other harmful products as part of a comprehensive fiscal and public health strategy.
According to him, by increasing excise taxes on tobacco, alcohol, SSB, and other health-harming products, Ghana can build a healthier, wealthier, er and more resilient future.
The health of Ghanaians is the foundation of the nations productivity, and no economic argument should be strong enough to undermine that, he said.
In a press statement, Musah noted that the Excise Duty (Amendment) Act, 2023, introduced an evidence-based approach to levying taxes on products that cause disproportionate harm to population health.
He explained that existing evidence shows excise taxes on such products are among the most cost-effective interventions available to governments.
Therefore, a review of these taxes would help to prevent and reduce harmful consumption, protect young people and low-income households, and mobilise predictable revenue to strengthen health systems overwhelmed by the rising tide of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
The call for tax reduction by industry actors is, therefore, misplaced and regressive as it represents a deliberate attempt to shift attention from public health imperatives to profit maximisation, he stated.
Musah urged the Ministry of Finance to remain steadfast in prioritising the health and well-being of Ghanaians above corporate interests, in order to achieve the healthcare policy objectives outlined by President John Dramani Mahama.
He cited the World Health Organisations Saving Lives, Spending Less report, which highlights the economic benefits of preventive health measures.
Every US$1 invested in tobacco control yields a US$7 return; every US$1 invested in alcohol control generates a US$9 return; and every US$1 invested in curbing unhealthy diets delivers up to a US$14 return. This demonstrates that strategic excise taxation and prevention measures are not only life-saving but also economically rewarding, he explained.
He stressed that every cedi lost through reduced excise rates would translate into thousands of preventable deaths, increased hospital admissions, and diminished workforce productivity.
The long-term sustainability of the health sector and the broader economy depends not on appeasing industry lobbyists but on reinforcing a tax system that internalises the true social cost of harmful products, he added.
To raise significant revenue for healthcare investment while reducing consumption of harmful products linked to chronic diseases, Musah proposed that the government increase excise taxes on harmful products such as tobacco, alcohol, and sugary drinks by 50 percent.
This, he said, would boost health sector funding and save lives amid dwindling donor support, underscoring the need for renewed domestic resource mobilisation to address Africas growing health challenges.
He further called for periodic tax adjustments indexed to inflation, coupled with strengthened enforcement and regional cooperation, to sustain the deterrent effect of such taxes and prevent cross-border leakages.
Musah also urged the government to reform the current excise tax structure to make it more effective and less susceptible to industry manipulation, tax avoidance, and evasion.
He recommended the implementation of a specific tax systembased on per stick for tobacco products and per content for alcoholand the introduction of an ad valorem excise tax on ultra-processed foods to discourage excessive consumption of unhealthy foods.
Additionally, he called for the adoption of a minimum pricing unit to set a threshold for all alcohol products, as part of broader efforts to protect public health and enhance accountability in Ghanas fiscal and health systems.",,Health, 12 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/VAST-advocates-health-taxes-and-accountability-2009210

Radiographers call for enhanced training and curriculum reforms,"The President of the Ghana Society of Radiographers (GSR), Dr Prince Rockson, has stressed the need for improved human resource capacity and enhanced training for radiography professionals to meet evolving global healthcare standards.
Speaking at the Hariet Duah inter-school quiz competition and the celebration of the 130th World Radiography Day in Accra over the weekend, Dr Rockson said that as medical imaging advances rapidly, Ghana requires highly trained professionals across specialized areas to deliver safe and efficient patient care.
It was on the home page; Celebrating the Power of Medical Imaging and the Radiographer behind the Image.
He noted that the current four-year radiography training in the country falls short of the level required to achieve imaging excellence.
According to him, some institutions have introduced pseudo-specializations at the first-degree level, a situation he described as inadequate for producing competent specialists.
The Ghana Society of Radiographers hopes that radiography institutions in Ghana urgently develop a harmonized curriculum in collaboration with the Allied Health Professions Council and the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission, he said.
Dr Rockson, who is also Togbe Kpegba Agbakpe I, Afetorfia of Taviefe Sreme, explained that such a move would pave the way for the recommended six-year radiography training system proposed by the West African Health Organization (WAHO).
He added that graduates from this advanced training structure will form the foundation for postgraduate specialization.
Dr Rockson said higher-level professionals would then be able to specialize in areas such as modality-specific imaging, image interpretation, research, teaching, administration, and other radiological sub-fields.
Touching on the significance of ongoing technological improvement in the profession, the GSR President said radiography continues to play a pivotal role in global medical practice and will remain crucial in shaping healthcare delivery in the years to come.
He also highlighted the invisible and sometimes potentially harmful nature of X-rays when improperly applied stressing that trained radiographers are required to carefully assess the risks, frequency, and dosage of radiation to ensure accurate diagnoses with minimal risk to patients.
A member of the Council of Elders of the Ghana Society of Radiographers (GSR) and lecturer at the University of Ghana, Professor William Antwi, paid tribute to the global radiography profession as Ghana joined the world to mark World Radiography Day.
He said the celebration honours Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, whose discovery of X-rays transformed medical practice, and recognizes radiographers whose work continues to save lives across Ghana and beyond.
Professor Antwi noted that radiographers play a crucial role in healthcare, turning invisible rays into life-saving diagnostic images. Every image we create brings clarity, supports healing, and saves lives. We are not just operators of machines; we are guardians of vision, partners in diagnosis, and pillars of modern healthcare, he stated.
Prof Antwi explained that the work of radiographers goes beyond imaging, describing it as illumination, since every scan reveals information hidden to the naked eye and guides critical medical decisions saying that radiographers efforts provide patients and clinicians with instruments of hope.
He commended Ghanaian radiographers for their resilience and professionalism in the face of challenges related to resource and technological constraints, adding that they continue to deliver quality service to hospitals and communities across the country.
Prof Antwi urged professionals to recommit to continuous learning, ethical conduct, teamwork, and mentorship to sustain the growth of the profession.
He emphasized the need to build a strong foundation for the next generation of radiographers to ensure continuous improvement in imaging services.
As we celebrate, let us nurture future practitioners with passion, ensuring that the light of our profession never dims. Together, we imagine the future of healthcare one patient, one scan, one act of service at a time, he added.
On his part, the National Organiser of the Ghana Society of Radiographers (GSR) and Director of Allied Health Services at the University of Ghana Medical Centre, George Nunoo, commended the growth of the radiography profession in Ghana as the country joined the world to mark World Radiography Day.
He said the Day offers an opportunity to honour radiographers globally and to reflect on their contributions to healthcare delivery. In Ghana, he noted, the celebrations focused on bringing professionals and students together through a quiz competition, professional engagement, and an assessment of the state of radiography education.
This marks our seventh event. We have previously held similar activities in Cape Coast and at the University of Ghana Medical Centre, he said. Our goal is to unite radiography students from diverse backgrounds so they understand each others fields and align with global standards.
He observed that radiography in Ghana had progressed significantly, moving from basic machine operators to highly trained specialists, including PhD holders such as the current GSR President. The perception of radiographers, he added, has evolved as the profession expands into advanced imaging areas.
According to Nunoo, the future of radiography in Ghana is promising, with more practitioners specializing in modalities such as MRI, CT, and interventional radiography.
He highlighted emerging fields such as cardiac CT and cardiac MRI, explaining that although cardiac MRI remains rare in Ghana, it is crucial for early detection of cardiovascular diseases.
Radiographers, he said, play an essential role in supporting doctors to identify and manage heart conditions through advanced imaging.
He encouraged radiographers to pursue further training and higher qualifications to keep pace with medical technology. X-rays, ultrasound, and MRI are important, but we must continue to elevate our practice and advance as a profession, he added.
World Radiography Day, marked globally on November 8, commemorates the discovery of X-rays by Professor Conrad Roentgen in 1895, a breakthrough that revolutionized medical practice.
The annual event emphasizes the important role of radiographers and promotes quality, safety, technological innovation, and public awareness of medical imaging.
The Ghana Society of Radiographers, the professional body for diagnostic radiographers, radiation therapists, and sonographers, continues to champion improved standards in radiological practice as part of its commitment to public health and professional advancement.

CHAG cautions against spiritual emptiness in Ghana's healthcare system,"The Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) has cautioned that efficiency without faith risks undermines healthcare, urging moral renewal to sustain compassion and ethics in health delivery.
At its annual conference in Koforidua, CHAG raised concerns over what it calls spiritual emptiness in the nations healthcare system, warning that hospitals risk becoming efficient but spiritually hollow.
Speaking at the conference themed: Sustaining Christian Identity, Values and Ethics in Health Systems Strengthening, the Executive Director, Dr Peter Kwame Yeboah, said almost eight million Ghanaians knock on our doors every year.
We provide compassionate, Christ-like care through 385 facilities across all 16 regions. Yet, we are beginning to see signs of moral fatigue among staff.
He cautioned that hospitals founded on prayer and compassion now would risk losing their spiritual foundation.
Our hospitals are becoming efficient, but spiritually empty, and that is not the foundation of our calling, he stressed.
Dr Yeboah highlighted CHAGs role in pioneering community-based health insurance schemes in the 1990s, which influenced Ghanas NHIS, adding, CHAG provides nearly one-third of the countrys healthcare services, particularly in communities often forgotten. We are the bridge between science and faith, compassion, and efficiency.
Delivering the keynote address, Apostle Eric Nyamekye, Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, reminded health professionals of their divine calling, saying, Every Christian in the health sector is performing a holy assignment. You are the salt and light in a world advancing medically but declining morally.
We live in an age of astonishing progress, yet millions still suffer needlessly. That is why we must heal not just the body, but the soul.
Health Minister Kwabena Mintah Akandoh commended CHAGs contribution, saying,
CHAG is more than a health provider; it is a custodian of faith, dignity, and humanity in our national health system.
He pledged the governments commitment under the upcoming Health Sector Medium-Term Development Plan (20262029) and policies such as the Free Primary Healthcare Policy.
Most Rev Joseph Afrifa Agyekum, Catholic Bishop of Koforidua, praised CHAG for delivering uninterrupted services, urging the Ministry of Health to keep health workers motivated.
The conference ended with a renewed call for moral and spiritual renewal in Ghanas health sector, emphasising that compassion and ethics must remain the foundation of care.",,Health, 11 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/CHAG-cautions-against-spiritual-emptiness-in-Ghana-s-healthcare-system-2009033
NHIA takes 'Operation Storm' to Bolgatanga township,"The Bolgatanga Municipal Office of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) has stormed the Bolgatanga township, market and lorry stations to sensitise traders, drivers and members of the public on the MyNHIS software application.
The application, launched in November 2022 to eliminate the long queues often seen at National Health Insurance offices across the country, could be downloaded from Apple or Google Play Store for use by members of the public with their Ghana cards.
Clad in official T-shirts of the Authority in a float, the Municipal officers, supported by their colleagues from the Regional and surrounding District offices, moved into shops to sensitise traders, and distributed National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) subscriber handbooks to them.
The officials also took time to engage pedestrians and explained to them how to link their NHIS cards to their Ghana cards, and offered the opportunity for members of the public to enrol onto the scheme and renew their invalid cards at a designated set-up point at the main lorry station.
Roland Abane Ayine, the Bolgatanga Municipal Manager of the Authority, told journalists during the exercise that it was the desire of the NHIA to enrol everyone onto the scheme to benefit from its application and offers.
He said the Authoritys message was basically on the application, which allowed members of the public to link their Ghana card to the NHIS card via the short code *929#.
The message is on the MyNHIS App, the *929# linking the Ghana card to the health insurance card and, more importantly, the automatic renewal feature in the *929#, where clients are allowed to link their NHIS numbers to their Mobile Money numbers for renewal prompts so they can consent to it before the card is renewed, he said.
Ayine said some people only realised they had invalid NHIS cards in emergencies, owing to the hitherto non-existent automatic renewal feature, With this automatic renewal feature, forgetfulness to validate NHIS cards will be a thing of the past.
We are targeting over a thousand people. So far, we have renewed a lot of cards, and from the way we are moving around, we believe that by the end of the day, we will hit the target, the Municipal Manager noted.
Some members of the public in random interviews with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) on the exercise expressed excitement about the Authoritys initiative and recalled days of long queues at offices of the Authority, especially at the Bolgatanga Municipal Office, just to renew their cards, which affected their daily activities.
Cynthia Anafo, who had just renewed her card, told the GNA that the Authoritys initiative to set up a registration and renewal point as part of the Operation Storm made it simple and much easier for her to renew her card.
She thanked officials of the Authority and called for more such initiatives and engagements with members of the public.",,Health, 11 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/NHIA-takes-Operation-Storm-to-Bolgatanga-township-2009023
Ghana Digital Centres CEO settles hospital bills of stranded nursing mother,"The Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Digital Centres Limited, Dzifa Gunu, has paid off the medical bills of a nursing mother who had been stranded for three months at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital after delivering her baby.
The mother, Doris Ametepey, a resident of Odorkor, had remained at the hospitals maternity ward for three months after being discharged because she was unable to clear her medical bills. Her situation worsened when her husband abandoned her and the newborn soon after delivery, leaving her helpless and confined to the ward.
Touched by her plight, Gunu made immediate arrangements for her bills to be settled, ensuring her prompt discharge and reunion with her family. The cash donation, made on behalf of the CEO by James Kanu Nartey-Oman, took place last Thursday at the hospital.
Receiving the support, a visibly emotional Ametepey expressed profound gratitude to  Gunu for what she described as a divine intervention.
I had no hope that any family member of mine could afford such huge medical bills. I kept praying for Gods help, and He has answered me through Mr Gunu, she said tearfully.
She recounted that she had delivered her baby through a caesarean section and had endured months of distress and uncertainty while confined to the hospital.
She described her ordeal as depressing and appealed to well-meaning individuals and organisations to come to the aid of other mothers in similar situations.

'Transfer him now!'  Eastern Region youth give Health Ministry 7-day ultimatum,"The Medical Director of the Eastern Regional Hospital, Dr Arko Akoto-Ampaw, is currently under fire following accusations of wrongdoing and administrative misconduct.
At a crowded press conference held in Koforidua on Friday, November 7, 2025, a youth group calling itself the Concerned Youth of the Reset Agenda  supporters of President John Dramani Mahamas Reset Agenda policy  issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to transfer Dr. Akoto-Ampaw from the hospital.
The group warned that failure by the authorities to act swiftly would compel them to enforce the Presidents Reset Agenda to normalize the situation at the hospital.
Clad in red armbands, the aggrieved youth accused Dr Akoto-Ampaw of defying a legitimate transfer directive and overstaying his post.
They argued that his continued stay at the facility undermines the governments efforts to inject new energy and accountability into the health sector.
According to the group, Dr Akoto-Ampaw has served as Medical Director for more than six years, far exceeding the standard tenure for such positions.
They alleged that despite being transferred under a national reshuffle of medical directors aimed at improving leadership and transparency, he has refused to comply.
The youth explained that Dr Akoto-Ampaw was granted a three-month grace period to settle his family before assuming his new posting  a period that has long expired. Yet, he continues to occupy the office unlawfully, they claimed.
They noted that the nationwide transfer exercise, initiated by the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, was intended to inject new leadership and align management with national efficiency goals.
However, confusion arose after a second letter reassigned the individual initially posted to replace Dr Akoto-Ampaw to the Hohoe Government Hospital, creating uncertainty around the succession process.
Following a meeting at the GHS headquarters, it was agreed that Dr Akoto-Ampaw would remain temporarily for three months  a condition he has since violated.
The group further emphasized that per the GHS directive, no medical director is supposed to serve more than a year at the same facility without transfer, stressing that Dr Akoto-Ampaws continued stay breaches policy and accountability standards.
They therefore issued a stern warning to the Director-General and the Ministry of Health to enforce the transfer directive without delay, insisting that no further extensions would be tolerated.
The youth accused Dr Akoto-Ampaw of lobbying influential persons to help him retain his position, allegedly boasting that the current GHS Director-General cannot remove him because he serves in an acting capacity and that he enjoys powerful backing.
The group also alleged financial improprieties and mismanagement under his administration, claiming that he has turned the hospital into a money-making venture for personal gain.
According to them, staff reports suggest that maintenance contracts funded by government are diverted to his associates, leading to inflated costs and missing items, including air conditioners and food meant for patients.
They further alleged that while the triage and emergency wards struggle with inadequate beds and basic consumables, Dr Akoto-Ampaw has chosen to fund his law education using hospital resources.
What policy in the Ghana Health Service permits a course of study with no direct benefit to the service to be sponsored with hospital funds? the group questioned, insisting that their claims are verifiable.
They added that Dr Akoto-Ampaw, together with several management members who have stayed at the facility for over six to twelve years, must be transferred immediately to prevent administrative stagnation and continued distractions.
The youth stated that they had initially exercised patience when the director requested time to relocate, but his continued defiance now suggests collusion with certain individuals in authority to subvert due process.
We assure all concerned that the youth will resist this by every lawful means necessary, the group warned. Any covert dealings between him and persons in power will soon be exposed.
The Concerned Youth of the Reset Agenda concluded by calling on President John Dramani Mahama, the Minister of Health, and the Eastern Regional Minister to intervene immediately, stressing that the growing frustration among the youth threatens to escalate if decisive action is not taken.", Kay Agbenyega,Health,  7 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Transfer-him-now-Eastern-Region-youth-give-Health-Ministry-7-day-ultimatum-2008555
Ghana's lab system must evolve from being reactive to predictive - Dr Akoriyea,"At the Sanctuary of Wind and Fire Assemblies of God Church in Accra, the nations medical laboratory professionals gathered on October 30, 2025, for the Annual National Congress of the Ghana Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists (GAMLS).
The event, themed Enhancing Laboratory Resilience: Combating Emerging Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) through Emerging Technologies, Collaboration and Research, brought together experts and policymakers determined to shape the next phase of Ghanas healthcare future.
Delivering the keynote address, Dr Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, Acting Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), underscored the indispensable role of medical laboratory scientists in safeguarding the nations health security and strengthening its response to emerging public health threats.
Recognizing unsung heroes of public health
Reflecting on his previous appearance at the 2020 GAMLS Congress in Takoradi, Dr Akoriyea expressed deep admiration for laboratory professionals who, often away from the public eye, form the backbone of the nations diagnostic and surveillance systems.
When COVID-19 struck, and when outbreaks of yellow fever and other infectious diseases challenged our system, he said, you stood firm. You provided data that guided national decisions, results that enabled timely treatment, and surveillance that kept communities safe. Ghanas resilience was made visible through your expertise and dedication.
He reminded participants that resilience is not built in emergencies but cultivated every day, emphasizing the need for constant preparedness, innovation, and capacity-building in laboratory practice.
The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance
Turning attention to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), Dr Akoriyea cautioned that the threat grows quietly but dangerously, rendering common treatments ineffective and reversing decades of medical progress. He described the laboratorys role in the AMR fight as irreplaceable, highlighting that accurate diagnostics, resistance surveillance, and timely reporting form the backbone of effective antimicrobial stewardship.
To combat this silent epidemic, he called for full utilization of emerging technologies  genomics, artificial intelligence, and digital data systems  as well as cross-sectoral collaboration under the One Health approach, linking human, animal, and environmental health.
Strengthening the laboratory workforce
Dr Akoriyea reaffirmed the Ghana Health Services commitment to empowering laboratory professionals through policies and programs designed to enhance skills, motivation, and infrastructure.
We cannot strengthen disease surveillance without prioritizing the workforce driving it, he declared.
He outlined a comprehensive agenda that includes:
He further revealed that the GHS is working closely with the Ministry of Health (MoH) to finalize the scheme of service and implement improved working conditions for laboratory scientists, ensuring that Ghana retains and motivates its best professionals.
A call for partnership and shared responsibility
Dr Akoriyea stressed that the task of strengthening laboratory systems cannot rest on one institution alone. Resilience, he said, is a shared responsibility. He called on government agencies, professional bodies, academia, and industry partners to collaborate and invest collectively in laboratory infrastructure, research, and workforce development.
He commended the ongoing management and quality improvement initiatives supported by the Ghana Health Service, assuring participants that such projects would continue and be expanded across the countrys healthcare facilities.
Renewed commitment for the future
Closing his address, Dr Akoriyea paid tribute to the dedication and professionalism of Ghanas medical laboratory workforce, describing them as central to the nations vision of a safer and healthier future.
Your work saves lives every day. Though you may often operate away from the public eye, the nation sees you, respects you, and depends on you, he affirmed.
He encouraged participants to let professionalism and quality management principles guide their work, urging them to use the congress as a platform to forge stronger partnerships and explore innovative solutions for emerging health challenges.
Building a system that anticipates, not reacts
As the 2025 GAMLS Congress commenced, Dr Akoriyeas message resonated powerfully: Ghanas laboratory system must evolve from being reactive to being predictive and resilient. Through investment in people, technology, and collaboration, the nation can build a health system that is not shaken by threats but prepared for them.
Together, he concluded, let us build a laboratory system that leads with innovation, guided by science, and driven by service. May God bless our homeland Ghana and make our nation great and strong.

Health minister pledges stronger lab systems to safeguard sector,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has reaffirmed the governments commitment to strengthening Ghanas laboratory systems as a central pillar in the countrys health security agenda.
He made this declaration while addressing participants at the opening ceremony of the 2025 Annual National Congress of the Ghana Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists (GAMLS), held at the Sanctuary of Wind and Fire Assemblies of God Church in Tamale on Thursday, October 30, 2025.
Government to sponsor nurses and midwives for PhD training -
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
Delivering his speech under the theme, Enhancing Laboratory Resilience: Combating Emerging Infectious Diseases and AMR through Emerging Technologies, Collaboration, and Research, the Minister emphasized that no health system can be effective without a strong and resilient laboratory network.
Laboratories: The backbone of health systems
Akandoh noted that the COVID-19 pandemic reaffirmed a fundamental truth  laboratories are the backbone of effective healthcare systems. Laboratories are central to disease detection, patient management, and health security, he said, adding that effective laboratories are essential for swift outbreak containment and accurate diagnosis.
He cautioned that weak laboratory systems often lead to delayed diagnoses, mismanaged conditions, and uncontrolled infections. Laboratory resilience, he stated, is therefore a non-negotiable pillar of health sector reform and the resetting agenda.
Confronting emerging diseases antimicrobial resistance
Addressing the theme of the congress, the Minister outlined Ghanas dual challenge of emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, cholera, and meningitis continue to test the countrys readiness and resilience.
Citing World Health Organization (WHO) data, Akandoh revealed that AMR is now the third leading cause of mortality globally, accounting for over a million direct deaths annually. He warned that without urgent action, routine infections may become deadly, and standard treatments ineffective.
He reaffirmed Ghanas commitment to the global agenda of reducing deaths linked to bacterial AMR by 10% by 2030, referencing the 2019 baseline of 4.95 million deaths. Strong laboratory capacity for surveillance, diagnostics, and stewardship, he stressed, has therefore become very critical.
Harnessing technology for smarter laboratories
Akandoh announced that the Ministry of Health is collaborating with GAMLS, academia, and the private sector to integrate emerging technologies into the national health system. He highlighted innovations in genomics, digital health, point-of-care diagnostics, and artificial intelligence as game-changers in medical laboratory science.
Smarter laboratories, he said, will not only diagnose but also generate real-time data to inform policy, guide treatment, and predict emerging threats. Ghana, he emphasized, cannot be left out in the global agenda of eliminating public health threats using technology.

Partnerships and professionalism for a resilient system
The Minister underscored the need for coordinated laboratory networks linking public, private, academic, and research institutions. He said the Ministry and the Ghana Health Service are developing frameworks to standardize quality management and deploy resources efficiently.
He urged the Association to continue championing professionalism and enforcing standards: GAMLS must remain a community of scientists dedicated to national service and complement governments efforts in healthcare reform.
Research and innovation as pillars of resilience
Akandoh described research as another cornerstone of laboratory resilience. He called for stronger collaboration between scientists and policymakers to ensure that local research findings directly inform national health planning.
Evidence-based decision-making depends on local research capacity, he said. We must support young scientists and ensure findings are translated into policy and practice.
Investing in people and infrastructure
The Minister reiterated governments commitment to retooling health facilities and recruiting additional professionals, including medical laboratory scientists, under the 2026 budget. He also highlighted plans to establish a postgraduate specialist college for laboratory scientists, fulfilling a key manifesto promise.
Government is resetting the health sector to retain local resources for local solutions while meeting global health targets, he affirmed.
Tackling unemployment and quackery in the health sector
Addressing concerns about unemployment among healthcare professionals, Hon. Akandoh said the Ministry is taking pragmatic steps to regulate training and indexing. He has directed the Chief Director to constitute a steering committee to implement the governments promise of establishing a Medical Laboratory Science Council.
This move, he noted, will help ensure quality training and curb quackery within the profession. Additionally, plans are underway to expand public health laboratory coverage to enhance disease surveillance.
Towards sustainable health financing and universal health coverage
As part of the Resetting Agenda, the Minister outlined government efforts toward sustainable health financing to ensure transparency, quality, and patient safety. These efforts, he explained, are integral to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and making healthcare accessible to all Ghanaians.
A call to collective action
In his closing remarks, Akandoh reminded the gathering that resilience is built by choice, not chance. He called on all stakeholders  government, donors, academia, industry, and professionals  to collaborate in building laboratories capable of safeguarding the nations health.
The future of Ghanas health system depends on your work, he told the scientists. Together, we can build laboratories that are resilient, innovative, and capable of protecting every Ghanaian.
With that, the Minister formally declared the 2025 GAMLS Congress open, wishing all participants fruitful deliberations.

Experts warn of rising type 2 diabetes cases among Ghanaian children,"The Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Society of Ghana has expressed worry over the rising number of type 2 diabetes cases among children.
According to the President of the Society, Professor Josephine Akpalu, discussions about diabetes often focus on adults, leaving the increasing prevalence among children overlooked.
Enhancing access to diabetes care in Ghana: A call for collaborative action
She explained that in many cases, diagnosis in children is delayed until complications set in.
Many times in our society, for children with diabetes, the diagnosis is really made very late. Sometimes, it is only when they come to the hospital with a severe complication, which can even be fatal, that the diagnosis is made, she said in an interview on Channel One TV, monitored by GhanaWeb on Friday, November 7, 2025.
Elizabeth Esi Denyoh calls for urgent national action on diabetes
Professor Akpalu stressed the need for greater awareness about childhood diabetes, adding that many people still do not associate the condition with children.
We want to create that awareness of the problem existing in children. It is becoming more of a challenge now for our children because we dont expect them to have that, she noted.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes remains a major public health issue, especially in low and middle-income countries like Ghana, where Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are responsible for about 45% of all deaths, with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes being major contributors.
The WHO advises that maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activities, keeping a normal body weight, and avoiding tobacco use can help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
It further notes that the condition can be managed effectively and its complications prevented or delayed through proper diet, exercise, medication, and regular medical screening.

Julius Debrah reaffirms government's commitment to free primary healthcare,"The Presidential Envoy for Inter-Faith and Ecumenical Relations, Elvis Afriyie-Ankrah, over the weekend represented the Chief of Staff, Julius Debrah, at the opening of the 2025 Annual Conference of the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG), held at the Capital View Hotel in Koforidua.
Delivering the Chief of Staffs keynote address, Afriyie-Ankrah conveyed warm greetings from the President of the Republic, John Dramani Mahama and commended CHAG for its sustained contribution to national health delivery, especially in rural and underserved communities.
The conference was held under the theme: Sustaining Christian Identity, Ethics and Values in Health Systems Strengthening.
Julius Debrah noted that the theme was timely and appropriate, calling for renewed commitment to the values that have shaped Christian health services for over a century.
He stated that prior to the establishment of the Ministry of Health, Christian missions laid the foundation for healthcare in Ghana by establishing hospitals, clinics and training centres that delivered not just medicine, but compassionate service.
He stressed that health infrastructure and equipment alone cannot guarantee a strong system, adding that integrity, professionalism and respect for human dignity are essential.
A resilient health system is built on ethical leadership, trust, and compassion, he said.
These are not only Christian values but national values necessary for sustainable development.
The government, he noted, recognises CHAG as a strategic partner, accounting for nearly one-third of healthcare services nationwide.
This partnership between Church and State is one of Ghanas quiet success stories, he said, assuring that the Government would continue to collaborate with CHAG through policy dialogue, fair resource allocation and capacity building.
He reiterated the Governments commitment to implementing the Free Primary Health Care Programme, aimed at eliminating financial barriers to basic healthcare.
No mother should die in childbirth because she cannot afford medical care. No child should suffer from malaria because treatment is out of reach. No elderly person should be turned away due to lack of funds, he emphasised.
He called on CHAG to support the programme through expanded community outreach and continued commitment to non-discriminatory service.
Touching on the conference theme, Afriyie-Ankrah urged CHAG institutions to remain intentional in safeguarding their Christian identity in an evolving world, advocating for transparency, accountability and ethical leadership.
Your Christian identity is not merely a label; it is your light, he said, referencing Matthew 5:16.
He commended CHAG for its decades of service, sacrifice, and innovation and encouraged members to remain steadfast in upholding high ethical and professional standards.
Building an ethical and effective health system is a shared duty, he said. May God bless CHAG, our health workers and our nation, Ghana.

"Expert warns against monopoly in health data management, urges inclusive approach","A prominent IT and Cyber Security Expert, Samuel Kwame Adomako, has raised concerns about the government's approach to the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS) issue.
According to Adomako, the health minister's decision to award the contract for the new Ghana Health Information Management System (GHIMS) to a single vendor poses a significant risk to the country's health data.
The Controversy Surrounding LHIMS
The Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, recently accused the company behind LHIMS of underperformance and blackmail, citing the vendor's refusal to hand over administrative access and health data to the state.
The minister claimed that the vendor's actions led to widespread disruptions in the national health data system.
The sector minister, therefore, announced the introduction of a new GHIMS platform, designed to manage health information across the country and provide real-time access to patient records nationwide.
Adomako's Concerns
Adomako believes that the health minister's approach is misguided and may lead to a monopoly in the health data sector.
He expressed skepticism about the minister's assurance that the GHIMS would be state-managed, unlike the LHIMS which was handled by outsiders.
In his view, this change in management approach wouldn't necessarily address the underlying issues.
He argues that ""awarding the contract to a single vendor, weather outsider or insider could compromise the security and integrity of Ghana's health data.""
Adomako is calling for a more inclusive approach, recommending that Ghanaian IT companies and experts be involved in the process and receive a portion of the contract.
Ending Monopoly
According to Adomako, the health database should be open for every hospital to purchase its own database apps in order to end the monopoly.
This approach would promote competition, flexibility and innovation in the health data management sector.
Negative Impacts of Depending on One Vendor
Adomako highlighted some of the negative impacts that the country may face if it continues to depend on one vendor.
He said that depending on a single vendor could stifle competition and innovation in the health data management sector.
According to him, relying on one vendor increases vulnerability to system failures or disruptions, as there may be limited alternatives or support.
He also noted that a single vendor might limit the flexibility and scalability of the health information system, making it harder to adapt to changing needs.
As the government moves forward with the implementation of GHIMS, it remains to be seen whether the concerns raised by Adomako and other experts will be addressed.

AHPC Registrar calls for a national reset of Ghanas Allied Health agenda,"The Registrar of the Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC) has called for a reset of Ghanas Allied Health agenda, urging professionals and regulators to work in harmony to strengthen the countrys healthcare delivery system.
The call was made during the 2025 Annual Induction and Oath-Swearing Ceremony of the AHPC, where 5,444 newly qualified Allied Health Graduates were formally inducted into the profession.
The event, held under the theme Resetting Ghanas Allied Health Agenda: The Strategic Role of the Regulator and the Professional, brought together policymakers, training institutions, regulatory bodies, and health sector stakeholders.
Delivering his keynote address on behalf the Minister of Health, Dr. Ignatius Awinibuno, Director of Allied Health, underscored the indispensable role Allied Health Professionals play in Ghanas healthcare system, noting that their work forms the foundation upon which other health professionals operate.
Often, when the story of healthcare is told, attention rests on doctors and nurses. Yet anyone who understands how a health system truly functions knows that without Allied Health Professionals, that story is incomplete, he stated.
He emphasized that the government is working closely with the AHPC and other stakeholders to ensure a more equitable distribution of health professionals across the country, especially in underserved communities.
For too long, the concentration of health professionals in urban centres has left rural and deprived communities underserved. We are determined to change that, Dr. Awinibuno said.
Dr. Ignatius Awinibuno also highlighted the Ministrys efforts to enhance digital health transformation, through the expansion of the national e-health framework and the integration of Allied Health data into Ghanas health information systems.
He commended the AHPC for maintaining professional standards and ethics, adding that regulation must be seen as a partnership rather than mere enforcement.
A well-regulated profession is the bedrock of public trust. The Council remains a strategic partner in shaping policy and ensuring that our training institutions produce competent practitioners ready for a 21st-century Ghana, he said.
In his address, Dr. Shirazu Issahaku, Registrar of the AHPC, welcomed the new inductees and celebrated the sectors progress, noting that the 2025 cohort marks a historic achievement for the Council.
Today, 5,444 newly qualified graduates from across the country will smoothly transition from studentship to healthcare service  a powerful testament to the vitality and growth of the allied health sector, he said.
Dr. Issahaku announced that the Council had, for the first time, successfully implemented Computer-Based Examination (CBE) for its national licensure examination, describing it as a major step towards modernization and transparency.
This innovation is not merely about technology; it is about fairness, efficiency, and credibility. It demonstrates our readiness to embrace a digital future where regulation and service delivery evolve hand in hand, he explained.
He charged the new professionals to serve with integrity, empathy, and commitment to continuous learning.
By taking the Allied Health Oath, you are pledging to uphold the highest standards of ethics, competence, and professionalism. The trust of the public is sacredonce earned, it must never be compromised, he emphasized.
Dr. Issahaku reaffirmed the Councils commitment to strengthening its regulatory systems and promoting professional development through collaboration with government and training institutions.
The Health ministry and the Registrar echoed a unified message: that resetting Ghanas Allied Health agenda requires collaboration between regulators, professionals, and policymakers to achieve universal health coverage and build a resilient, equitable, and technology-driven health sector.
The 2025 induction ceremony marks a new chapter in Ghanas health workforce development, with thousands of newly licensed professionals joining the nations effort to deliver quality healthcare to every Ghanaian.

"KATH, Ridge among 12 institutions referred to AG for failing to recover public funds","The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament has directed the Attorney General to prosecute 12 public institutions, including Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) and Ridge Hospital (Greater Accra Regional Hospital), for failing to recover funds flagged as financial losses in the Auditor-Generals report, according to myjoyonline.com news report on November 3, 2025.
According to the report, the decision follows the institutions disregard for a directive issued by the Committee, which required them to retrieve and account for the missing funds within 30 days.
Those who havent complied within the 30-day deadline will all be recommended to the Attorney General for prosecution. Its just that simple, Ranking Member of the Committee and Member of Parliament for Komenda Edina Eguafo Abrem, Samuel Atta-Mills said.
He further indicated that institutions granted longer recovery windows of 60 or 90 days would also face prosecution if they fail to act.
Maybe they would like to enjoy sitting in court, he remarked pointedly.
The Committees move marks a decisive shift in Parliaments approach to enforcing financial discipline in the public sector transitioning from issuing audit queries to initiating criminal proceedings against defiant officials.
The decision was triggered by a briefing from Michael Addo, Assistant Auditor-General at the Ghana Audit Service, who informed the Committee that one month after appearing before PAC, the affected institutions had still not fully retrieved funds lost through infractions such as unearned salaries and unauthorized payments.

Their failure to comply with the Committees post-hearing directive, an integral aspect of enforcing the Public Financial Management Act, necessitated referral to the Attorney Generals Department under constitutional provisions.
Although the PAC did not immediately disclose all 12 entities, sources indicate the list includes some of Ghanas leading public hospitals Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) and Ridge Hospital (Greater Accra Regional Hospital).
A full list of the affected Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) has been forwarded to the Attorney Generals office for further action.

Government has the right to audit health data systems  Dr Kwame Asiedu,"A Democracy and Development Fellow in Health at the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Dr Kwame Sarpong Asiedu, has stated that the government is fully within its rights to audit health data systems, describing such data as national security information.
His comments come amid the ongoing standoff between Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions Limited and the Ministry of Health, following allegations of overpayment and claims that the company had deliberately disrupted healthcare services to frustrate the government.
Lightwave, the firm behind Ghanas National E-Healthcare Programme and the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS), has denied the allegations, calling them misleading and unfounded.
Lightwave E-Healthcare dismisses health minister's claims over National E-Health project
The company insists that it has met all contractual obligations and that health facilities using the system continue to operate efficiently.
According to a report by myjoyonline.com on November 3, 2025, Lightwaves Senior Project Manager, Eric Agyei, disclosed that the company had not been informed of any official audit, despite reports that the Ministry had sent people to hospitals under the guise of Lightwave representatives.
Responding to the matter, Dr Asiedu clarified that while the state has every right to conduct an audit, such an exercise must follow due process and adhere to existing laws.
Health data is national security data because it contains disease and death rates, prevalence rates, medicines used, and other medical information. The state has every right to audit from the data controller, which is the hospitals, to the data processor. Theres no problem with the state doing an audit; that is allowed globally, he explained.
He emphasised that Lightwave, as a data processor, does not own the information it manages, and that the data ultimately belongs to the state.
The audit they cannot run away from because they are not the data owner. Nobody should delude themselves that the state doesnt have a right to investigate from the patient through the hospital to the data processor. The law allows the state to investigate end-to-end, he stated.
However, Dr Asiedu cautioned that if the companys claim of impersonation during the audit process is true, it raises serious ethical and legal concerns.

If there was impersonation, that is wrong, he said.
The Ministry of Health is yet to publicly respond to Lightwaves latest statement. The controversy has reignited broader discussions about data ownership, cybersecurity, and accountability in Ghanas digital health systems, as the country works to expand electronic healthcare delivery nationwide.

Lightwave E-Healthcare dismisses health minister's claims over National E-Health project,"Lightwave E-Healthcare Solutions Limited has rejected allegations by the Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, concerning the management of Ghanas National E-Healthcare Programme and the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS).
In a detailed statement issued on October 31, 2025, the company described the ministers remarksmade in Parliament on October 28 and repeated during the Presidencys Accountability Series on October 29, as false, misleading and damaging to Ghanas digital health transformation.
Lightwave, which developed and implemented the LHIMS platform, stressed that it is a wholly Ghanaian-owned company, established in 2015 and employing more than 150 local staff.
It added that its sister company, Lightwave E-Healthcare Services LLC, based in Atlanta, Georgia, is also owned by the same Ghanaian shareholder.
Addressing claims that Ghanaian medical data was being hosted or managed from India, the company clarified that all patient data is securely stored within Ghana under the full control of the Ministry of Health.
The healthcare data of Ghanaians remains the property of the Ministry of Health. It is neither managed nor stored in India or any foreign location, the statement affirmed.
While acknowledging that the LHIMS software remains its intellectual property, Lightwave explained that the Ministry was granted a licence to use the platform for the duration of the contract, consistent with international software licensing practices.
The company outlined its track record on the National E-Healthcare Project, stating that it successfully completed Phase One in 2017, deploying LHIMS in 23 health facilities across the Central Region, including the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital.
Lightwave Contract Saga: Okoe Boye challenges Mintah Akandoh over fine details
Phase Two of the project, valued at US$100 million, was approved in 2019 to expand deployment to 950 facilities nationwide.
In response to claims that only half of the project had been executed despite 77 percent of the contract value being paid, Lightwave said such assertions were misleading.
According to the company, the projects financial structure assigned higher cost weights to teaching and regional hospitals, meaning progress should be measured by contract value rather than the number of facilities.
As of December 31, 2024, Lightwave had fully deployed the system in all four teaching hospitals, six regional hospitals and 243 district hospitals, representing about 72 percent of the contract value, the statement noted.
Lightwave attributed project delays largely to late payments from the Ministry, with some invoices outstanding for over 10 months, as well as disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The company also disclosed that it had not received payment for eight months of post-contract work, despite repeated assurances from the Ministry.
In addition, it claimed to have completed extra work worth approximately US$25 million, such as system integrations with the National Health Insurance Authority, commercial banks, pharmacies and the Births and Deaths Registry, none of which has been compensated.
According to the company, currently, the LHIMS platform remains operational in more than 200 health facilities across the country, including the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Eastern Regional Hospital, Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital and Walewale District Hospital.
Lightwave expressed disappointment over the current standoff but reiterated its readiness to work with the Ministry to complete pending installations and sustain the systems reliability.
The LHIMS platform has served Ghana effectively for nearly nine years. It remains one of the continents most robust e-health systems. We hope this clarification ends speculation and allows for a constructive resolution.""

Ghana will succeed in fighting poor sanitation - Ahmed Ibrahim,"Ghana is on track to overcome the long-standing challenge of poor sanitation through collective national effort and renewed commitment at all levels, Ahmed Ibrahim, Minister for Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, has said.
He said the overwhelming public participation, strong media support, and active involvement of traditional authorities and religious leaders in the national sanitation day programmes were clear indicators of progress.
The Minister was speaking at the November edition of the National Sanitation Day, which involved monitoring of the exercise in the La Dade-Kotopon Municipality, the Ledzokuku Municipality, and the Krowor Municipality.
Some of the areas in the Municipalities monitored included Tsui bleoo last stop down to Mobil, and the Nungua Secondary School to Addongonno Street and Railway line.
Ibrahim said the enthusiasm from participants was remarkable, resulting in approximately 98 per cent compliance.
However, the main challenge faced was logistical support.
He said the Ministry was still in the process of procuring essential sanitation equipment, including dustbins, containers, compactors, wheelbarrows, wellington boots, and shovels.
""I am confident that with increased momentum in the procurement of these logistics, the upcoming December cleanup exercise will be even more successful,"" he added.
The Minister said President John Dramani Mahama was expected to launch new sanitation equipment soon, and that they would ensure timely provision of the required resources to complement that effort.
He said in collaboration with the Municipal, Metropolitan and District Chief Executives, and the relevant sector ministries, plans were underway to install additional streetlights to improve visibility and safety during such exercises.
""Regarding the Environmental Service Providers Association (ESPA), I intentionally refrained from public commentary after their recent statement announcing an ultimatum to government by November 7""
""Instead, I opted for dialogue. As a Ministry, we have engaged ESPA in constructive discussions to address their concerns, and I have assured them that I will meet with other stakeholders to find sustainable solutions,"" he added.
Oboade Nortse King Professor Nii Odaifio Welentsi III, the Nungua Mantse, reaffirmed his commitment to supporting the President's directive for the exercise, emphasising the importance of collective participation to sustain progress in the fight against poor sanitation.
He urged the Member of Parliament and Municipal Chief Executive of La Dade-Kotopon Municipal Assembly to engage the management of La Palm Royal Beach, Pleasure Beach, and Laboma Beach, for a meeting with him at the Regional House of Chiefs to highlight to them that sanitation was a collective responsibility and not solely the duty of the government.
""The management of these establishments are to contribute to the proper reconstruction of the gutters along the main road leading to their facilities, as this will improve environmental hygiene and enhance the appeal of their businesses,"" he added.
Nii Welentsi III, who doubles as the President of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs, called on the public to cultivate a culture of cleanliness without waiting for directives.
He also reminded community leaders of their responsibilities, stressing that leadership was not only about meetings and appearances, but about service and accountability to the people.
He cautioned against the illegal sale of lands, warning that unregulated practices could lead to future complications.
""If we continue to sell lands irresponsibly, we may one day find ourselves buying lands from strangers or having none left to buy,"" he said.
He disclosed that the Regional House of Chiefs would soon introduce a policy to regulate land sales, noting that anyone found selling more than an acre without authorization would face sanctions.

UNFPA warns of contraceptive shortages as crisis looms for women's health,"The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a stark warning about the global erosion of access to contraceptives as the world prepares for the seventh International Conference on Family Planning (ICFP 2025) in Bogota, Colombia, from November 16, 2025.
In a statement, UNFPA Executive Director Diene Keita emphasized that contraceptives save lives, underscoring nearly 50 years of recognition by global health authorities as essential medicine. Yet, funding shortfalls are now threatening stocks in communities worldwide, including Ghana, where reliance on international aid could unravel hard-won gains in reproductive health.
Keitas remarks come at a critical juncture, just days before ICFP 2025; the worlds premier gathering of advocates, researchers, policymakers, and youth leaders focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Hosted for the first time in Latin America, the conference theme, Equity Through Action, calls for urgent collaboration to safeguard family planning amid rising challenges.
For Ghana, a nation that has made strides in family planning but faces acute vulnerabilities, the statement resonates deeply, highlighting the need for sustainable domestic investment to protect women and girls from unintended pregnancies, maternal deaths, and economic setbacks.
How Ken Ofori-Atta allegedly defied Bawumia's directive to analyse GRA-SML deal - Senyo Hosi
The Global Imperative: Contraceptives as Lifelines
People want [contraceptives], use them, and rely on them every day, Keita affirmed, pointing to overwhelming evidence of their transformative power.
When women and adolescent girls have access, pregnancies are more likely to be planned and safe, enabling them to complete education, secure employment, and realize their potential.
Healthier children and more prosperous societies follow, with contraceptives proven to reduce abortion rates and complications from pregnancy and childbirth.
The economic case is equally compelling: Every $1 invested in addressing unmet contraceptive needs generates nearly $27 in benefits, from averted healthcare costs to boosted productivity.  U
NFPA and partners have spent decades fortifying supply chains to deliver quality, affordable options, even to remote areas, saving millions of lives. But global funding gaps, exacerbated by geopolitical shifts and aid cuts, are causing stocks to dwindle. Health systems brace for surges in unintended pregnancies, linked to higher maternal mortality (including from unsafe abortions), adolescent pregnancies, school dropouts, and gender-based violence.
Keitas call to action is clear: Lets work together to keep our promise to women and adolescent girls, uphold their rights and choices, and ensure they have access to the contraceptives they need to plan and forge a healthy and prosperous future.
As ICFP 2025 convenes, this message will fuel discussions on innovative financing, equitable access, and resilient health systems.
Ghanas Story: Progress Under Threat
In Ghana, UNFPAs alert, echoes local realities, where family planning has been a cornerstone of maternal health improvements. The countrys modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) among women aged 1549 stands at about 27%, up from previous years, reflecting government efforts like the Costed Implementation Plan and integration into the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).
Yet, three in 10 women still face unmet needs, with regional disparities stark, particularly in the North, where indicators lag due to cultural barriers, limited facilities, and low awareness.
Funding disruptions amplify these risks. Historically, USAID covered 45% of Ghanas contraceptive procurement, but a recent stop-work order has created a massive gap.
UNFPA now supplies 40%, the West African Health Organization (WAHO) 5%, and the government just 10%, leaving supplies vulnerable.  Without swift action, Ghana risks reversals in its FP2030 commitments and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 3 on health and well-being.
The human toll is evident in the numbers: Unintended pregnancies account for 37% of all pregnancies, with 23% mistimed and 14% unwanted.  Over half (58%) of births to girls aged 15-19 and one-third to those aged 20-24 are unintended, fueling unsafe abortions that contribute 12-30% of maternal deaths; the third leading cause after hemorrhage.
Ghanas maternal mortality ratio remains high at 310 per 100,000 live births, with adolescents facing even greater risks  1.8 times higher without modern methods.
Pathways Forward: Lessons from Ghana for ICFP 2025
Ghanas response offers hope and a blueprint. The Ghana Health Service (GHS) Director-General, Dr. Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, recently urged ramping up domestic financing during National Family Planning Week, emphasizing integration into universal health coverage.
UNFPA Ghana advocates for a dedicated budget linealready approved for essential commoditiesand comprehensive sexuality education in schools to empower youth.    Partnerships with organizations like Marie Stopes International and the Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana have expanded access, but more is needed to bridge the 35% unmet need among married women and 20% among unmarried ones.
At ICFP 2025, Ghanaian delegates are expected to amplify these voices, sharing successes in supply chain strengthening and calls for global solidarity.
Keita implores, protecting these investments is non-negotiable. For Ghanaian women and girls, from bustling Accra markets to northern villages, continued access to contraceptives isnt just health policy; its a pathway to dignity, education, and prosperity.

Presidency holds Breast Cancer Awareness commemoration at Jubilee House,"The Office of the President, on Friday, October 31, 2025, held a commemorative event at the Jubilee House in observance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, under the theme: Catch it Early, Treat it Right, and Survive it.
The event brought together policymakers, health professionals, Presidential staffers, officers at the Office of the President, advocates, and survivors to reaffirm Ghanas national commitment to early detection, equitable treatment, and continuous public education on breast cancer.
Delivering the keynote address,
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo
, Deputy Chief of Staff (Admin), emphasised that the fight against breast cancer must move beyond awareness to action and access.
She described breast cancer as a national health priority and a social equity issue, urging collaboration across government and civil society to make screening and treatment accessible to all.
We must resist the temptation of making this theme another slogan because we are losing many friends, loved ones, and colleagues to breast cancer, she said.
Nana Oye also highlighted the governments continued commitment to building a healthier population under the leadership of President Mahama and Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, citing key initiatives such as the Mahama Trust Fund for chronic disease treatment, including breast cancer.
She also commended Her Excellency Lordina Mahamas nationwide health screening outreaches in partnership with the Ghana AIDS Commission, reaffirming that these efforts demonstrate Ghanas dedication to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases such as breast cancer by 2030.
She commended Ghanaian women and men who continue to lead advocacy and community outreach, adding that empowering people with knowledge is the first step toward reducing breast cancer mortality nationwide.
Professor Dr Grace Ayensu-Danquah, Deputy Minister of Health, delivered the opening remarks, highlighting the governments ongoing commitment to strengthening early detection systems and improving cancer care services across the country.
She reiterated that public education, preventive screening, and destigmatisation are critical pillars in building a healthier Ghana.
Our goal is to make early detection routine, not rare, Dr Ayensu-Danquah noted. Under the esteemed leadership of His Excellency,
John Dramani Mahama
, we remain committed to equipping our systems to fight breast cancer.
The program also featured insights from medical professionals Dr John Yaw Antwi and Dr Cynthia Amissah, who digitally demonstrated proper breast self-examination techniques, discussed preventive strategies and treatment options, and encouraged the normalisation of self-examination and regular check-ups.
They cautioned that myths and fear often delay treatment and urged open conversations about breast health across communities.
Equally moving were the survivor stories, moderated by Lily Mohammed, Senior Broadcaster at EIB Network. The testimonies echoed a unifying message: early detection and timely care save lives. One survivor recounted how a routine check-up led to her survival, while another described finding purpose and strength after recovery. Both called on others to check early and never lose hope.
I am alive today because I checked early, one survivor shared. No one should wait until its too late to know.
The commemoration concluded with a strong collective message: breast cancer awareness must extend beyond October, becoming a sustained national movement for prevention, compassion, and healing.
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo
and Dr Ayensu-Danquah reaffirmed the governments dedication to promoting preventive healthcare, strengthening cancer treatment infrastructure, and ensuring that early detection remains a national health priority.
Let this not end as an October conversation, another survivor urged. Let us carry this message into every home, every school, and every workplace, because saving lives begins with speaking up, checking early, and treating right.
Through this initiative, the Presidency reaffirmed its commitment to promoting health awareness, empowering individuals, and fostering a culture of preventive healthcare across the nation.",,Health,  2 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Presidency-holds-Breast-Cancer-Awareness-commemoration-at-Jubilee-House-2007719
FDA warns public not to patronise Omama Herbal Mixture,"The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has urged the public not to patronise an anti-malaria medicine known as Omama Herbal Mixture.
In a statement issued Friday, October 31, 2025, the FDA said the herbal medicine contained some chemicals, which could be dangerous when used without a prescription.
The FDA concluded a laboratory analysis and market surveillance conducted in collaboration with the Ghana Police Service, the statement said.
The laboratory analysis revealed that Omama Herbal Mixture has been adulterated with Diazepam, Metronidazole, Paracetamol and Niacinamide, which are allopathic medicines, it said.
It is important to note that Omama Herbal Mixture is registered as a herbal medicinal product indicated for Malaria and Loss of appetite and is not expected to contain any allopathic medicines.
The medicines found in Omama Herbal Mixture are dangerous when taken without prescription and/or advice from a qualified health professional.
The Authority added that it would work with Omama Herbal Group Limited to recall all products on the market for safe disposal and appropriate regulatory actions, including criminal prosecution initiated.
The FDA wishes to assure the public that it will not relent on its efforts to ensure public health and safety.
The public is advised to give information on persons, pharmacies, and over-the-counter medicine sellers (OTCMS) offering Omama Herbal Mixture for sale to the nearest FDA Offices.
As part of its market surveillance early in October this year, the FDA also suspended the operations of nine sachet water producers in the Western North Region over expired registration license.
The sachet water producers were within the Wiawso Municipality and the Bia West and East districts.
Albert Ankamah, the Western North Regional Director of the FDA, said the exercise was to ensure that water producers, food and drug manufacturers complied with good manufacturing, hygienic and storage practices to ensure the safety of consumers.",,Health,  1 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/FDA-warns-public-not-to-patronise-Omama-Herbal-Mixture-2007657
'Breast cancer is curable if detected early' - Deputy Chief of Staff calls for action,"As part of activities commemorating Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Presidency organised a Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Programme for its staff.
A statement issued by the Presidency said the event, which took place at the Banquet Hall on Friday, October 31, was on the theme: Catch it Early, Treat it Right and Survive it.
It involved a series of activities, including experience sharing, health talk, panel discussion, open forum and breast cancer screening (at the Clinic).
Nana Nana Oye Bampoe Addo, the Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of Finance and Administration, encouraged periodic screening and stated that breast cancer was treatable and curable when detected early.
She also reiterated the governments commitment to investing more in health infrastructure, training, access to quality care and medicine.
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo noted that it was all a collective duty to support efforts at achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims at reducing maternal mortality and non-communicable diseases such as breast cancer by 2030.
As we commemorate Breast Cancer Awareness Month at the Office of the President, let us remember that early detection is not just a medical act, she said.
It is an act of love, an act of courage, and an act of survival. Lets catch it early and give life a fighting chance. When we treat it right, we restore hope. And when we survive it, we inspire countless others to do the same.
The Deputy Chief of Staff added, No woman, no family, no one should walk this path alone. Lets fight breast cancer together. Lets fight not only for a cure but for the dignity and hope and healing for us all.
She noted that the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares) covered specialist-level treatments for chronic diseases, including breast cancer, and complemented the already existing coverage of the National Health Insurance Scheme.
Nana Oye Bampoe Addo also noted that testimonies by survivors and the increase in public education were making an impact and must be sustained.
To you as survivors, we stand with you in courage and compassion. Lets all replace stigma with support and silence with solidarity, she said.
Professor Grace Ayensu-Danquah, the Deputy Minister of Health, who is also a distinguished surgeon, used the occasion to counsel participants, particularly the female staff, to undergo regular screening.
Together we can build a future where no one faces breast cancer alone, where survival is not a privilege but a promise.
The month of October each year is observed worldwide as Breast Cancer Awareness month to create awareness, promote early detection and treatment of the disease.
According to the World Health Organisation, in 2022, there were an estimated 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 670,000 deaths globally.",,Health,  1 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Breast-cancer-is-curable-if-detected-early-Deputy-Chief-of-Staff-calls-for-action-2007648
Ban all forms of mining  Health administrators urge President Mahama,"The Association of Health Administrators of Ghana (AHSAG) has called on President John Dramani Mahama to, as a matter of urgency, impose an immediate, temporary ban on all forms of mining activities across the country.
The Associations demand stemmed from the undeniable, severe risks unregulated mining activities pose to public health, environmental sustainability and the very fabric of mining communities.
Reverend Ezekiel Amadu Daribi, President of AHSAG, said mining, particularly small-scale operations, had inflicted widespread contamination of otherwise crystal clear water bodies, devastated aquatic ecosystems and poisoned drinking water sources.
The health implications of these, he said, were unqualifiedly alarming, ranging from respiratory illnesses and skin diseases to long-term chronic conditions due to exposure to toxic chemicals commonly used in these mining processes.
The adverse effect of this on our health, our water bodies, and the peoples systemic livelihood is enormous and irreversible.
The continued allowance of mining activities threatens to overturn decades of public health progress and compromises the future well-being of Ghanaian citizens.
Only a firm, decisive ban can halt the alarming degradation currently unfolding in the country, to enable the government to craft and enforce rigorous regulatory frameworks to safeguard health and the environment, Rev Daribi said at the 48th Annual Conference and Continuing Professional Education Programme of AHSAG in Cape Coast.
The conference was on the theme: Optimising Internal Resources Mobilisation for Infrastructure and Equipment Management; The Position of the Health Service Administrator.
The forum of Ghana Health Service (GHS) Administrators provided the platform for professional engagement and knowledge sharing, on resource mobilisation and prudent management of infrastructure and equipment at various health facilities.
Dr Kwasi Addai-Donkoh, Chairman National Council of AHSAG, lamented the dwindling external funding and uncertainty, and the imperative to harness and optimise internal resources by health administrators.
He said infrastructure and equipment formed the backbone of any functional health system, but without strategic management, they become liabilities rather than assets.
However, he urged health administrators to be innovative to leverage internal resources to address the shortfalls in the management of health infrastructure and equipment as a critical area of investment that required unfathomable thinking and action.
This is where Health Service Administrators stand tall. As custodians of operational efficiency, Health Service Administrators are inimitably positioned to lead the charge in resource mobilisation.
Whether through innovative budgeting, strategic partnerships, improved revenue generation and retention, or data-driven asset management, our role is no longer peripheral is central.
We must reimagine our facilities not just as service delivery points, but as dynamic ecosystems capable of generating, managing, and reinvesting resources. This calls for a shift in mindset from gatekeeping to stewardship, from routine management to visionary leadership, he explained.
The Central Regional Director of Ghana Health Administrators urged health administrators to always scrutinise contracts, particularly Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), some of whom she described as fleecing the country.
She stressed the need for them to avoid the misuse of utilities and remain professional in the discharge of their duties at all times.
Dr Kwasi Addai-Donkoh, Chairman of the National Council of AHSAG, expressed concern over declining external funding for health and its uncertainty, emphasising the urgent need for health administrators to effectively harness and optimise internal resources.
He said infrastructure and equipment were vital to any functioning health system, but without strategic health management, they risk becoming liabilities instead of assets.
In that light, Dr Addai-Donkoh called on health administrators to adopt innovative approaches to utilise internal resources, addressing gaps in managing health infrastructure and equipment, demanding bold thinking and decisive action.
Health Service Administrators hold a crucial role. As guardians of operational efficiency, they are uniquely positioned to lead in resource mobilisation.
Whether through creative budgeting, strategic partnerships, enhanced revenue generation and retention, or data-driven asset management, our role has evolved from peripheral to central, he stated.
Dr Alberta Adjeibey Biritwum-Nyarko, the Central Regional Director of the GHS, urged health administrators to carefully review health contracts, particularly PPPs and MoUs, warning that some arrangements exploited the country.
She stressed the importance of avoiding waste in utilities, putting idle resources to prudent revenue ventures by instilling discipline and professionalism at all times.
Ekow Panyin Okyere Eduamoah,  Central Regional Minister, in a brief remark, commended the group for holding forth for nearly five decades of service to Ghana.

Speaker Bagbin leads breast cancer awareness drive,"As part of Ghanas observance of October as the Pink Month, dedicated to breast cancer awareness, Speaker of Parliament,
Alban Bagbin
, has made a striking financial contribution towards the fight against breast cancer.
Speaking on the floor of Parliament on Friday, October 31, 2025, Bagbin announced that each Member of Parliament would have GH1,000 deducted from their November salary, with his own top-up of GH24,000, culminating in a GH300,000 donation to the Breast Society of Ghana.
Bagbins remarks extended beyond financial support and urged wives to actively involve their husbands in breast health, encouraging them to teach their partners how to perform breast screenings.
In a controversial yet candid moment, Bagbin also advised women not to imprison their breasts in brassieres, suggesting that openness and regular checks were vital in the fight against breast cancer.
His comments, though unconventional, were aimed at breaking cultural taboos and promoting early cancer detection.
By framing breast health as a shared responsibility within families, Mr Bagbin emphasised the importance of awareness, education, and proactive care.
The Speakers initiative adds momentum to Pink Month activities nationwide, reinforcing the message that breast cancer is not just a womens issueit is a societal one.
Dr Mahama Tia Kabiru, Member of Parliament for Walewale, while contributing to the discussion, described the breast as an endangered organ due to the rising threat of cancer.
He emphasised that while women were the biological hosts of the breast, its benefits extended to babies and husbands, making its care a shared responsibility.
In a passionate appeal, the legislator urged husbands to actively support their wives by ensuring they undergo breast screening every six months.
The legislator noted that this was not just a health imperative, but as a gesture of love and partnership.
According to Dr Kabiru, early detection through regular screening was key to combating breast cancer and preserving lives.
He also cautioned against what he termed the imprisoning of the breastlikely referring to restrictive cultural attitudes or neglect that prevent open discussion and proactive care.
His comments suggest a need for greater awareness and destigmatization of breast health issues, especially in communities where such topics may be considered taboo.",,Health,  1 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Speaker-Bagbin-leads-breast-cancer-awareness-drive-2007640
"'Dadesen' pots linked to cancer, kidney diseases - FDA","The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has warned the public over the widespread use of locally-made cooking pots, popularly known as Dadesen, after detecting dangerously high levels of lead in them.
According to a report by 3news.com, the Eastern Regional Manager of the FDA, Anita Owusu-Kuffour, made this known during a stakeholder engagement at Somanya.
She revealed that FDA surveillance uncovered a troubling practice among some local manufacturers who deliberately add lead during production.
When they are making the pots, the metal becomes hard, so they add lead to soften it. The sad part is that most local manufacturers have no idea about the health implications.
We are advising the public to stop using Dadesen that contains lead, he noted.
FDA urges vigilance, warns of arrests for unsafe food sales
Anita Owusu-Kuffour further cautioned against the use of worn-out nonstick cookware, explaining that once the protective coating erodes, it can release harmful heavy metals and toxic chemicals into food.
If the coating wears off, you are exposing yourself to serious health risks, including cancer, because some of these coatings contain heavy metals.
Chronic Kidney Disease in Ghana: Treatment challenges and prevention tips
As science and technology improve, it is important for all of us to move away from harmful practices and embrace safer alternatives, she emphasised.
The FDA said lead, a highly toxic heavy metal, makes the metal easier to mould but exposes users to severe health conditions such as cancer, kidney failure, and Parkinsons disease.

Ghana convenes stakeholders to advance WASH Sector Action Plan for NDC revision,"The Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs (MLGCRA), in collaboration with the Ministry of Works, Housing and Water Resources (MWHWR), has convened an expert consultation workshop to support the development of a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Sector Action Plan as part of Ghanas ongoing revision of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
To facilitate multi-stakeholder engagement in the development of a comprehensive WASH Sector Action Plan, the workshop brought together stakeholders from government institutions, development partners, academia, civil society, the private sector, and youth networks.
This inclusive process underscores Ghanas commitment to integrating climate action across all sectors while ensuring alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and national development priorities.
Stakeholders represented included the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the Ghana Rice Inter-professional Body, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research  Savanna Agricultural Research Institute (CSIR-SARI).
Development partners such as UNICEF Ghana, UNDP Ghana, WaterAid Ghana, and World Vision Ghana also participated, alongside professional associations, private sector actors, and youth climate organisations.
The WASH Sector Action Plan serves as a strategic blueprint for integrating climate change considerations into both national and sub-national WASH programming.
It outlines clear sectoral priorities, highlights opportunities for impactful climate action, and identifies existing barriers within water, sanitation, hygiene, and solid waste management. By developing a strong climate rationale, the plan aims to inform Ghanas NDC revision process.
Ultimately, it seeks to align the sectors commitments with the countrys broader vision for a climate-resilient and low-carbon development pathway.
Through technical presentations, thematic discussions, and consensus-building plenary sessions, participants worked collaboratively to shape sectoral recommendations and priority actions.
The outputs of the workshop will contribute directly to Ghanas NDCs 3.0, extending the countrys targets to 2035 in line with international frameworks, while simultaneously enhancing the ambition of commitments and unlocking finance at scale.
As part of its broader mandate to support inclusive and ambitious climate action, UNDP Ghana provided technical and logistical support to the consultation process, helping to ensure broad participation and meaningful dialogue across sectors.
Mohammed Gyimah, Deputy Director at the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, highlighted the importance of the meeting:
Strengthening Ghanas climate response requires cross-sector collaboration and evidence-based planning. This workshop has provided us with an opportunity to define sectoral priorities and identify practical pathways for integrating climate action into WASH. The outcomes will not only inform the revision of our NDCs but also guide long-term strategies for resilience and sustainable development.
This initiative demonstrates the strong collaboration between the Government of Ghana and its development partners, with UNDP reaffirming its commitment to advancing climate-resilient development and supporting Ghana in delivering on its NDC commitments.", Information Ghana,Health, 31 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ghana-convenes-stakeholders-to-advance-WASH-Sector-Action-Plan-for-NDC-revision-2007537
Okoe Boye urges Chief of Staff to mediate Lightwave contract dispute,"A former Minister of Health, Dr
Bernard Okoe Boye
, has appealed to the Chief of Staff,
Julius Debrah
, to intervene in the dispute over the termination of a contract between the Ministry of Health and Lightwave Health Information Management System.
In a report by 3news.com on October 29, 2025, Dr Okoe Boye cautioned that failure by the Chief of Staff to step in could result in financial loss to the state.
I would recommend that the Chief of Staff engages the services of a professional mediation company. I know of Gamey and Gamey. I did some courses with them. Let Gamey and Gamey come in. They can take up the case from both the Ministry of Health and the vendors angle and help resolve this amicably, he said.
Health minister outlines 4-week plan to restore Ghana's electronic healthcare system
His comments followed a statement made earlier by the current Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, during the Government Accountability Series, where he disclosed that investigations by the ministry had revealed significant anomalies in the execution of the contract with Lightwave Health Information Management System.
Dr Okoe Boye criticised his successor for failing to handle the termination process in an orderly manner, warning that the approach being taken could lead to the repetition of already completed work and unnecessary expenditure.
This minister, what he has failed to do is to find a way to orderly terminate the contract. One grave consequence is that when the minister was asked, you have now gone in for someone, and guess what, this new person is not going to complete the rest of the five hundred. He is going to redo the 450 that Lightwave has done. Can you imagine? This is a serious financial loss, he stated.
He expressed concern that the ministrys actions could result in wasteful spending, as the government risks paying a new vendor to repeat work already completed by Lightwave.
LHIMS system disruption caused by vendor 'sabotage' - Health minister
What makes me worried for this country is that we have a minister who is ready to pay a new vendor to start again, work that has already been done, but is unwilling to say that let me give you this money so that you complete this work, so that I can now have access to everything you have. This minister is about to put the government in a serious financial loss situation, he indicated.
Dr
Bernard Okoe Boye
further urged the media to scrutinise the issue closely, warning against repeating past mistakes.

"Dr Okoe Boye defends Lightwave, calls for fair resolution of e-health dispute","Former Minister of Health, Dr Bernard Okoe Boye, has dismissed recent claims made against Lightwave e-Healthcare Solutions, the company that implemented Ghanas National e-Health Project, describing the ongoing controversy as an attempt to give a dog a bad name to hang it.
In a statement titled The LHIMS Controversy: A Case of Giving the Dog a Bad Name to Hang It, Dr Okoe Boye outlined the background of the project and challenged what he described as misinformation surrounding its implementation and management.
He explained that the National e-Health Project began in 2016 to digitize and network all government health facilities. The initiative, which started with 25 facilities in the Central Region, was expanded after a successful pilot.
Following approvals from the Public Procurement Authority and the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health signed a US$100 million contract in March 2019 with Lightwave e-Healthcare Solutions for a nationwide rollout he revealed.
According to Dr Okoe Boye, Lightwave has so far digitized more than 450 health facilities, including four teaching hospitals, six regional hospitals, and over 240 district hospitals. More than 150,000 health workers have been trained under the project.
He noted that implementation delays were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain challenges, and difficulties in compliance by some facilities. Payments so far total US$76.99 million, with about US$23 million outstanding.
The former minister disputed several claims made by the current Minister of Health, including suggestions that Lightwave is a foreign company and that Ghanas health data is stored outside the country.
Lightwave is a wholly Ghanaian-owned company, and all patient data is stored locally in servers managed by the Ministry of Health, he stated.
Dr Okoe Boye questioned the governments decision to engage a new company, the Ghana Health Information Management System (GHIMS), to replace Lightwave.
He argued that GHIMS is not a state-owned entity and has digitized fewer than five facilities, compared to the extensive work already completed by Lightwave.
He warned that replacing Lightwave could lead to data loss, financial waste, and disruption of health services for millions of Ghanaians.
The logical approach would be to allow any new vendor to continue from where Lightwave left off, not to redo completed work, he advised.

GHS cautions public as seasonal flu cases rise across Ghana,"The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has cautioned the public about a rise in seasonal influenza (flu) cases across parts of the country.
In a statement, the Service said the country is currently experiencing increased infections caused by Influenza A strains H3N2 and H1N1viruses that commonly circulate during Ghanas cooler months.
The highest number of cases has been recorded in the Greater Accra, Central, Bono and Eastern Regions.
According to 3news.com report on October 29, 2025, GHS explained that symptoms of the flu appear suddenly and may include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headache and fatigue.
GHS confirms influenza outbreak in four regions
The disease spreads mainly through droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking, and by touching contaminated surfaces.
According to the Service, children and adolescents in school, the elderly, pregnant women and people with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are at higher risk of contracting the infection or developing complications.
High-risk environments include schools, dormitories, markets and transport hubs.
To help curb transmission, the GHS urged the public to seek medical attention early when flu-like symptoms appear, stay home when unwell, practice regular handwashing with soap and water, cover coughs and sneezes, disinfect frequently touched surfaces, avoid crowded places and wear face masks when necessary.
On the institutional level, health facilities have been directed to enhance surveillance and diagnostic testing, update case management protocols, and intensify public education through community and media channels.
H3N2 Outbreak: 42 cases confirmed in Greater Accra Region  Report
The Service is also coordinating with regional health directorates to ensure a timely and effective response.
The Ministry of Health, through the GHS, assured that all necessary measures are being implemented to manage the situation and called for public cooperation to protect individuals, families, and communities from further spread.

Health minister outlines 4-week plan to restore Ghana's electronic healthcare system,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has announced a four-week roadmap to resolve the ongoing breakdown in Ghanas electronic healthcare management system.
Addressing journalists at the Government Accountability Series on Wednesday, October 29, 2025, he said the government has procured a new platform, the Ghana Healthcare Information Management System (GHIMS), to tackle the disruptions and ensure continuity of healthcare delivery nationwide.
Akandoh explains why Agenda 111 projects, nurses' arrears were not in 2025 Budget
He explained that health facilities across the country will be gradually migrated onto the new system within four weeks.
The plan, going forward, is that in the next one week, we are going to begin with the teaching hospitals, the regional hospitals, and the highly populated district hospitals, to roll them over onto the system. In the second week, well move to the remaining district hospitals, and in the third week, well focus on the clinics, health centers, and CHPS compounds.
I am confidently announcing to the good people of this country that we have a four-week plan that will get us out of this mess, Mintah Akandoh said.
He reaffirmed the governments commitment to strengthening Ghanas digital health infrastructure.

The medical records of Ghanaians would never go back to the manual way. We are moving forward, responsibly, confidently, and decisively, he added.
The breakdown of the old system caused significant delays in patient registrations, record-keeping, and claims processing, especially in the Ashanti Region, where several hospitals reverted to manual operations.
Patients have since complained about prolonged waiting times and slower service delivery.

LHIMS system disruption caused by vendor 'sabotage' - Health minister,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has alleged that the recent disruption of the Lightwave Health Information Management System (LHIMS) was an act of blackmail by the vendor, intended to pressure the government into removing key clauses from a new agreement.
According to him, the new maintenance agreement between the government and the LHIMS vendor required the company to hand over data and grant the state full administrative access to the system.
Speaking at the Government Accountability Series on Wednesday, October 29, 2025, the minister noted, however, that the vendor objected to these provisions.
To avoid this disruption and the shutdown we are experiencing, although we didnt have any contract with the vendor at the time we took over, we indicated to them that the ministry was ready to sign a service maintenance agreement covering the 450 health facilities.
Dont forget that the software is and was not for the state, that is why it is called LHIMS. In the agreement, we indicated that before we sign such an agreement with you, you have to hand over the data to the state, and you must give us administrative access to the service. The vendor insisted that those clauses must be removed from the agreement, he added.
Akandoh further noted that the governments refusal to remove the clauses prompted the vendor to intentionally disrupt the system.
We cannot expunge those clauses from the agreement because it is the state that must take charge of this data. So, the vendor decided to switch the system off as and when he desired, and demanded what he wanted. This has gone on for more than two months, and for the past two weeks or so, the system has been completely down. If this is not blackmail, I dont know what it is, he stated.
What your NHIS card can do for you
The Minister of Health further said that the government is developing a new state-owned platform, the Ghana Healthcare Information Management System (GHIMS), which will replace LHIMS and ensure national control over medical data.
Meanwhile, the breakdown of the LHIMS system has caused widespread delays in record-keeping and patient processing, particularly in the Ashanti Region, where many hospitals have reverted to manual operations.
This comes after patients expressed frustrations over prolonged waiting times and slower service delivery.

Ghana urgently needs strict laws for equitable health care distribution - Dr Agyemang,"The Member of Parliament for Abuakwa South, Dr Kingsley Agyemang, has emphasised the need for strict legislation to ensure fair distribution of health personnel and facilities across Ghana.
Known for his advocacy on improved healthcare delivery, the MP highlighted the challenges ordinary Ghanaians face in accessing quality and affordable healthcare.
Speaking on OTEC FM's afternoon political show, DWABREM, on Monday, Agyemang expressed concern over the uneven distribution of health facilities in the country.
""About 70 to 80 percent of well-trained specialists are found in Kumasi and Accra, so the question is, how do we as a country allocate resources, including human capital, in the health sector?"" he queried.

Poor mental health among adolescents is a growing public health concern- GES Coordinator,"Ernest Ampah, School Health Education Programme (SHEP) Coordinator of the Ghana Education Service (GES), has described adolescent mental health as a growing public health concern requiring urgent and coordinated action.
He said about 20 per cent of adolescents worldwide experienced mental health or behavioural problems, with depression being the single largest contributor to illness among young people aged 15 to 19 years.
Ampah said suicide remained one of the three leading causes of death among adolescents globally, a worrying trend that reflected realities in Ghanaian schools.
Ampah was speaking at a three-day workshop in Accra, organised by Hope for Future Generations (HFFG) in collaboration with the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC) and the Ghana Education Service under the Adolescent Girls and Young Women (AGYW) project that seeks to ensure HIV prevention, stigma reduction, and youth empowerment.
The three-year initiative is targeting adolescent girls and young women aged 15 to 24, both in and out of school, across seven districts including parts of Greater Accra, Kumasi, and the Eastern Region.
Ampah noted that good mental health enabled young people to learn effectively, work productively, and contribute to their communities as well as making informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health while ensuring the prevention of HIV infection.
When adolescents experience poor mental health, it becomes difficult for them to cope with daily life, school pressures, and social challenges, he said.
He emphasised that the adolescent stage is a critical phase of transition that shapes lifelong wellbeing, yet issues such as family conflict, stigmatization, sexual abuse, teenage pregnancy, chronic illness, and academic stress often triggered emotional distress, anxiety, and depression among students.
Healthy development during adolescence contributes to strong mental health and prevents future mental disorders and untreated mental health conditions often persist into adulthood, he said.
Ampah said the GES, through the School Health Education Programme, (SHEP) continued to train teachers to identify signs of distress among students, such as sudden withdrawal, mood changes, substance use, or suicidal thoughts and to refer them for psychosocial support.
The GES SHEP Coordinator also called for stronger collaboration between schools, families, and community health systems to help manage mental illness, as schools alone were unable to do it.
He called for the provision of safe, inclusive, and friendly environments that promoted psychosocial well-being such as planting of trees, creating shaded resting areas, and making classrooms welcoming, saying, Clean and secure school environments give peace of mind to learners.
Ampah urged teachers and parents to treat adolescents as resources to be nurtured, not problems to be fixed.
We must listen compassionately, offer hope, and avoid hastily involving parents if they are the source of a childs distress. The goal is to help, not to stigmatize, he advised.
He further underscored the need to build adolescents psychosocial skills, including self-awareness, stress management, empathy, and non-violent conflict resolution, to help them make responsible life choices and resist risky behaviours such as substance abuse or unsafe sex.
Developing these skills promotes self-esteem, resilience, and positive peer relationships. It also helps prevent violence and sexual abuse, he added.
Ampah reaffirmed the GESs commitment to promoting abstinence, sexual purity, and responsible behaviour through age-appropriate, culturally sensitive education embedded in the national curriculum.
He also called on stakeholders in health, education, and social protection to integrate adolescent mental health into broader public health strategies to ensure a generation of emotionally strong, confident, and healthy young people.",,Health, 27 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Poor-mental-health-among-adolescents-is-a-growing-public-health-concern-GES-Coordinator-2006795
"Ghana National Polioplus Committee, partners unveil 'end polio now' billboard","The Ghana National PolioPlus Committee (GNPPC) in collaboration with its Polio partners on Friday October 24, 2025 unveiled a giant End Polio Now billboard, in Accra, drawing attention to the world community to eradicate poliomyelitis from the surface of the earth.
The ceremony was led by the Chair of the GNPPC, Past Assistant Governor of Ghana District of Rotary International, Gertrude Adzo Akpalu and was attended by members of the GNPPC, the District Governor Nana Yaa Siriboe, Past Assistant Governors, Assistant Governors, Rotarians, Rotaractors and Interactors.
The unveiling of the billboard in Accra formed part of the activities of the organisation, in observing this years World Polio Day, commemorated on 24 October every year.
This years theme: End Polio: Every Child, Every Vaccine, Everywhere is a call to ensure that no child, in any setting, is left unprotected.
Ghana has been declared polio free with about 99 percent eradication, despite being declared polio free some years earlier.
The little presence of the disease is as result of variants, mostly found in unhealthy environments.
District Governor Nana Yaa Siriboe, together with Dr Raymond Dankoli, Co-ordinator of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative; Prof John Kofi Odoom, a virologist at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, Legon, with Rotarians and Rotaractors from different clubs across the country could not hide their smiles as they posed for the cameras at the unveiling of the billboard.
As the cameras clicked, the celebrants shouted in a refrain: Polio at one place, polio everywhere to drive home the need to ensure the eradication of vaccine-derived strains and variants from unhealthy environments.
Some of the celebrants, wearing End Polio Now tee- shirts flaunted placards that read: Make History Today, Thank You for Helping to Eradicate Polio, I Want To/ Will End Polio among others.
The District Governor commended Rotary, its partners, and members in Ghana for their selfless services in ensuring that vaccination reached every child, saying that the organisation was committed to eradicate the disease.
Thank you all for helping eradicate polio, she said.
Prof Odoom in a media interview stressed that surveillance to check new variants of the disease, mostly attributed to unhealthy environments.
Some Rotary clubs in Ghana that had paid their contributions towards polio eradication initiatives were recognised and given certificates.
Polio is a highly contagious disease caused by the polio virus. Although very rare, the virus can attack the parts of the brain that help you breathe, which can lead to death.
Some of the symptoms of polio are flulike symptoms of fever, fatigue sore throat, headache, digestive issues, signs of brain and spinal cord swelling, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness and muscle spasms.
The disease is found in poop, transmitted from person to person, primarily through the faecal-oral route, where the virus spreads via contaminated hands, food, or water. It can also spread through respiratory droplets from sneezes or coughs, although this is less common.
The virus can be spread by an infected person who may not have symptoms.
A secondary mode is through respiratory droplets in an infected environment.
Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with vaccination.

Breast milk not a cure for eye problems  Optometrist advises parents,"The Head of Eye Unit at the Ga North Municipal Hospital, Dr Godwin Asamoah Ahiakwao, has cautioned parents against applying breast milk to their childrens eyes, warning that the practice can lead to severe infections rather than healing.
Speaking during a free eye-screening exercise organised by the hospital to mark World Sight Day 2025, celebrated under the theme, Love Your Eyes, Love Your Sight, Dr Ahiakwao described the habit as dangerous and medically unfounded.
We want parents to stop using breast milk on their childrens eyes because it can cause infections, including severe ones. This is because breast milk is not sterile and can introduce bacteria into the eye, he stated.
According to a myjoyonline.com report dated October 26, 2025, the Principal Optometrist explained that breast milk, though rich in nutrients, could worsen eye conditions.
Breast milk is not a cure for apollo, it will rather worsen it  Senior Optometrist
Dr Ahiakwao therefore urged parents to seek professional medical care immediately when they observe any abnormality in their childrens eyes.
He reminded parents that clear vision is fundamental to learning and cognitive development.
Its the eyes they use for learning and reading, so parents must make sure their childrens sight is always checked, he said.
As part of the celebration, the Ga North Municipal Hospital conducted a free eye-screening exercise for pupils of Silicon Valley International School, successfully examining about 1,000 students.
The exercise aimed to promote early detection of vision problems and encourage a culture of regular eye check-ups.
Dr Ahiakwao also advised against excessive screen exposure, particularly among children and office workers, recommending the 20/20/20 rule for maintaining healthy vision.
For every 20 minutes of close work, take a 20-second break and look 20 metres away. That simple practice helps to relax the eyes and prevent strain, he explained.
Rural dwellers cautioned against unconventional eye treatments
The schools Head of Junior High and Boarding House Supervisor, Dominic Owusu Ansah, expressed appreciation to the Ga North Municipal Health Service for its proactive initiative.
He noted that the collaboration has positively influenced pupils academic performance by addressing vision-related challenges early.
He emphasised that early intervention in eye health directly improves learning outcomes, underscoring the link between good eyesight and educational success.

What to know about a rapidly rising form of breast cancer thats hard to detect,"Rates of one type of breast cancer  invasive lobular carcinoma  have been rising in the United States more than three times faster than those of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade, according to a new study.
This elusive breast cancer thats hard to spot in routine mammograms is behind more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.
The research, published in Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, analyzed national data from 2012 to 2021 and found that rates of invasive lobular carcinoma increased by about 2.8% each year, while rates of all other breast cancer rose by about 0.8% a year.
What exactly is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?
To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimores health commissioner.
CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it?
Dr Leana Wen
: Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.
ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the National Cancer Institute. About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.
CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms?
Wen
: This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesnt change the breasts structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.
CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC?
Wen
: A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that dont show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.
These tests arent routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.
CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk?
Wen
: Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.
CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer?
Wen
: Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.
Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.
CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC?
Wen
: Treatment is similar to that for other breast cancers. Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.
CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer?
Wen
: Some risk factors cant be changed, such as age or family history, but many lifestyle choices can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.
Regular screening and knowing whats normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.
Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.",,Health, 25 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/What-to-know-about-a-rapidly-rising-form-of-breast-cancer-that-s-hard-to-detect-2006662
Ghana AIDS Commission warns of declining condom use among youth,"The Ghana AIDS Commission (GAC) has raised concern over declining condom use among the youth, attributing it to reduced fear of HIV and AIDS infections.
Isaiah Doe Kwao, Director of Research, Monitoring and Evaluation at the Commission, said although condoms remained widely available, many young people were becoming complacent about their sexual health, opting for unprotected sex despite the risks.
Even though we have condoms in this country, it appears the youth of today are not using them as we would want, he told the Ghana News Agency at the 14th National Partnership Forum on HIV and AIDS in Accra on Wednesday.
Kwao explained that some young people preferred going raw and believed HIV was no longer deadly due to fewer visible deaths.
Some say they prefer the natural feel. Others think HIV is no longer deadly because they no longer see people dying like before, so the fear factor is gone, he noted.
Kwao described the perception as dangerous, stressing that condoms remained one of the most effective tools for preventing HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancies.
As much as possible, we continue to encourage them to reduce risky behaviours. Condom use is still key in preventing HIV and other infections. We advise them to either abstain, remain faithful to one partner, or use condoms consistently and correctly, he said.
Kwao urged young people to take their health seriously, noting that their wellbeing was vital to Ghanas future development.
The youth are the future leaders of this country. We want them to stay safe, grow into healthy adults, and contribute meaningfully to national development, he added.
On Ghanas goal of ending AIDS by 2030, Kwao said the Commission was developing a strategic plan (20262030) to guide interventions towards achieving the global 95-95-95 targets.
This would ensure that all persons living with HIV know their status, receive treatment, and achieve viral suppression.
Kwao noted that inadequate funding remained a major challenge following the withdrawal or reduction of support from donor partners such as USAID and the Global Fund.
It is incumbent on the government of Ghana to fill in the gap so that we can implement the interventions weve laid out, he said.
Kwao appealed to the private sector to support the national HIV response through corporate social responsibility initiatives and contributions to the Ghana HIV and AIDS Fund.
We have developed a short code, *9898#, where individuals can donate as little as one cedi to support HIV activities in the country, he added.
Kakra Essamuah, Board Chair of the GAC and Chairperson of the event, said the Commission remained committed to mobilising domestic resources to sustain Ghanas HIV response and eliminate AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.
He commended stakeholders for their continued collaboration and called for renewed commitment and innovation to address emerging challenges in the national HIV response.
Representatives from UNESCO, the Global Fund, NAP+ Ghana, and the Ghana Employers Association pledged continued support to Ghanas efforts in combating HIV and AIDS.

"Weija-Gbawe MP raises concern over collapse of NHIS, decry return to cash-and-carry system","The Member of Parliament for Weija Gbawe Constituency in the Greater Accra Region, Jerry Ahmed Shaib, has expressed deep concern over the deteriorating state of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), stating that the scheme is no longer functioning effectively.
According to him, patients across the country are increasingly being compelled to pay for healthcare services out of pocket, a situation that signals a troubling return to the cash-and-carry system the NHIS was designed to replace.
Speaking on the floor of Parliament, Shaib lamented that even pregnant women undergoing Caesarean Sections (CS) are being charged exorbitant fees ranging from GH5,000 to GH9,000, which he described as unacceptable.
He therefore called on the government to take urgent steps to restore the efficiency and credibility of the NHIS to ensure that Ghanaians, especially vulnerable groups, can access quality healthcare without financial hardship.",,Health, 24 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Weija-Gbawe-MP-raises-concern-over-collapse-of-NHIS-decry-return-to-cash-and-carry-system-2006572
Koreans in Ghana receive life-saving skills training,"The staff of the Korean Embassy and Korean agencies in Ghana have benefited from comprehensive life support and first aid training.
The exercise forms part of efforts to ensure timely and effective response to emergencies within the Korean community and complements Ghana's broader push to enhance public awareness and preparedness for emergencies.
The event was held at the premises of the Korean Embassy in Accra.
The training was a special collaboration between the Korea Foundation for International Healthcare (KOFIH) and the Ghana National Ambulance Service.
Alhassan Mohammed Mashud, the Head of Special Operations and Emergency Preparedness at the National Ambulance Service, highlighted the significance of the training, noting that it contributed to improving emergency awareness among the populace.
""A few years back, when we started the Ambulance Service, the awareness was so very low... out of 100 per cent, I would say about 40% are now aware of the emergencies in the country,"" he stated.
He said only about 30 per cent of Ghanaians knew the appropriate steps to take when an incident, such as a road traffic accident or cardiac arrest, occurred.
Mashoud stressed the need for the public to call the emergency number, 112, and remain on the line to receive guidance from the dispatch centre while an ambulance is en route for rescue.
He also cautioned bystanders against rushing to remove casualties from accident scenes, explaining that improper handling often leads to ""further injury, which could cause paralysis to some of the victims and even result in death.""
Mashud disclosed that the lack of advanced technology to precisely locate callers in emergencies forced the service to rely on Google location sharing or landmark descriptions from callers.
He made a strong case for advocacy and sponsorship to acquire modern location-tracing technology.
Bomin Yang, the Country Director of the KOFIH office, affirmed that the training was designed to support the ""Korean people and Korean agencies in Ghana.
""As an Official Development Assistance (ODA) agency under Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare, KOFIH saw the provision of basic life support and first aid training to embassy and agency staff as a necessary health-support measure.'
""At least now our family, our agencies, our Korean agencies and embassy staff can save the lives of their families. So I feel this is very successful,"" Yang said.
He indicated that while KOFIH was primarily an ODA agency supporting Ghana's Ministry of Health with professional training in maternal and child health care and biomedical engineering, the event marked the first time such training had been extended to the Korean community.
Yang announced plans to hold a similar training event for Korean residents in Tema next month.",,Health, 22 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Koreans-in-Ghana-receive-life-saving-skills-training-2006300
Dr Kingsley Agyemang urges African Parliaments to enact laws to end health injustice,"The Member of Parliament for Abuakwa South, Dr Kingsley Agyemang, has called on African parliamentarians to enact and enforce laws that confront health injustice across the continent.
Delivering the keynote address at the 5th Federation of African Law Students (FALAS) Continental Conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the theme Legislating for Health Justice: Advancing Universal Health Coverage in the Pan-African Context, Dr Agyemang emphasized that the journey toward achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) must be anchored in laws that guarantee equality, accountability and access for every citizen.
He warned that the future of public health in Africa depends not only on the construction of hospitals but also on the strength of the laws that determine who can access them.
The Abuakwa South legislator shared the story of a young mother who walked more than six kilometres to reach the nearest health centre, only to discover that the nurse on duty had no delivery kit to assist her. According to Dr. Agyemang, the woman wrapped her newborn in her own scarf and whispered that she was simply grateful her baby had survived.
For me, that moment was a painful reminder that, in many parts of Africa, giving life remains a dangerous journey, he recounted. That encounter taught me that legislation must not only allocate funds; it must protect dignity. When a mother walks that far to give life, society must walk even further to make that life thrive.
He described the story as a mirror reflecting the harsh realities faced by many African familieswhere people live far from health centres, struggle without reliable medical supplies, and endure the consequences of inadequate policies.
No woman should risk her life or her babys life because of a missing delivery kit, he declared, his voice echoing through the hall of the African Union Headquarters. Health justice must not remain a dream; it must become a legislative duty.
Dr Agyemang urged lawmakers across the continent to move beyond rhetoric and commit to comprehensive legal reforms that make healthcare equitable, accessible, and truly universal.
He argued that it is not enough to build hospitals and announce reforms; rather, nations must establish systems that ensure no patient is turned away because of poverty, geography, or governance failures.
Health injustice anywhere in Africa threatens the dignity of all Africans, he said, calling for a continental approach that harmonizes national health laws and aligns them with the African Unions Agenda 2063 and the Africa Health Strategy.
Dr Agyemang further stressed that African parliaments must strengthen their oversight functions to ensure that health budgets and policies produce measurable impact.
Oversight is the conscience of democracy  the means by which citizens voices are amplified and governments are held accountable, he said. Laws without monitoring are empty promises. When parliaments demand transparency and insist that budgets reflect real human needs, justice moves from paper to people.
He also underscored the importance of sustainable health financing and capacity building, insisting that every African government should dedicate a fixed portion of its annual budget to health infrastructure, preventive medicine, and community health initiatives.
Dr Kingsley Agyemang to deliver keynote at FALAS Continental Conference
However, Dr Agyemang cautioned that financing alone is not enough trained personnel must be available to deliver services, particularly in rural and underserved regions.
The distance between a rural clinic and an urban hospital can mean the difference between life and death, he observed. Equity begins when we close that gap.
Dr Agyemang further urged African parliaments to collaborate beyond national borders by creating inter-parliamentary platforms to share legislative tools, data, and best practices. Such cooperation, he said, would accelerate the continents progress toward universal health access and reduce duplication of effort.
When nations share knowledge and innovation, no community is left behind, he remarked.
Dr Agyemang commended the African Union for promoting health integration through initiatives such as the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the African Medicines Agency.
He urged member states to adopt shared standards to ensure access to safe and affordable healthcare across the continent.

Parents' quest for 'hype' schools fuel corruption in SHS placement - Dr Gyamfi,"A lecturer at the Akenten Appiah Menka University of Skills and Entrepreneurial Development (AAMUSTED), Dr Abraham Gyamfi, has revealed that many parents select Category A schools for their wards solely for the prestige associated with them.
According to Dr Gyamfi, this trend has led to corruption and manipulation in the Senior High School (SHS) placement system.
Speaking on Kumasi-based OTEC 102.9 FM's morning show Nyansapo, on Tuesday October 21, 2025, hosted by Kwaku Owusu Boateng aka KOB, Dr Gyamfi explained that some parents are willing to pay large sums of money to secure placements for their children in these highly sought-after schools, often referred to as ""big schools.""
""When it comes to the selection of schools, some people select based on hype,"" Dr. Gyamfi stated. ""If you like, let's say the performance of any of these big schools is going down, still those in power will choose the school because of their names.""
Dr Gyamfi further alleged that some individuals exploit the system, using their influence or money to secure placements for their children while blocking others.
""So, they try everything possible to get the slot there; they go behind the system to block certain individuals even before the random selection process begins on the computerized placement system,"" he claimed.
""Some parents ready to get the hype pay for the slots to a point it turns competition sometimes.""
The lecturer called for a fair and transparent system that would give less privileged students a chance to secure placements in Category A schools.

Take action against galamseyers  GHOSPA tells government,"The Government and Hospital Pharmacists Association (GHOSPA) has raised deep concern over a surge in kidney and liver diseases in communities heavily impacted by illegal mining, commonly known as ""galamsey.""
The association warns that this trend poses a major national public health threat.
According to a citinewsroom.com report on October 20, 2025, the association directly links the rise in renal and hepatic complications to the contamination of water sources used by households in mining areas.
This contamination is caused by high levels of mercury and other toxic metals discharged during illegal mining operations.
Illegal mining increasing kidney, liver diseases  Deputy Information Minister
National Chairman of GHOSPA, Dr Emmanuel Owiafe, emphasised the escalating crisis while speaking on the sidelines of the Pharmacy Technicians Association of Ghanas (PTAC) 16th Annual General Conference on October 17, 2025.
Dr Owiafe stressed that the problem has become a national menace, demanding immediate political intervention.
A number of patients are now being reported with increased issues related to their kidneys and livers, and it is becoming a menace to the entire population, he stated.
That is why we, as the Pharmaceutical Society of Ghana and the GHOSPA alike, are calling for swift and decisive action from the government, he said.
He added that while the health implications of galamsey have been extensively discussed by the association, the time for dialogue is over.
We have examined several aspects of the health effects of galamsey. The decision now must be something decisive that the government can take, Dr Owiafe stressed.

Ghana launches first OSH profile to boost workplace safety nationwide,"The Ministry of Labour, Jobs and Employment has launched Ghanas first-ever National Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Profile, marking a major step toward creating safer and healthier working environments across all sectors of the economy.
The OSH Profile, described as a foundational document, will serve as the basis for the formulation of a comprehensive national policy and legislation on occupational safety and health.
Speaking at the launch in Accra, the Minister for Labour, Jobs and Employment, Dr Abdul-Rashid Hassan Pelpuo (MP), hailed the initiative as a historic milestone that underscores the governments determination to strengthen occupational safety systems and protect the well-being of Ghanas workforce.
This launch marks a new phase in Ghanas journey to institutionalise occupational safety and health, Dr Pelpuo said.
Our goal is to ensure that every worker  in both the formal and informal sectors  operates in a safe, healthy, and dignified environment.
He noted that the OSH Profile aligns Ghanas standards with international labour conventions and best practices, paving the way for the development of a National OSH Policy and legislation.
Dr Pelpuo also lauded the creation of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for implementing the Work in Fishing Convention (C188), calling it another important measure to protect vulnerable workers.
Our fishers feed the nation, and it is our responsibility to ensure that their working environment is safe and decent, he said.
The SOP is a practical tool to make that commitment a reality.
Representing the Ghana Employers Association, Mr Alex Frimpong Amoah emphasised the urgency of improving workplace safety across all industries.
He cited recent incidents such as building collapses and workplace accidents as avoidable tragedies that threaten productivity and national development.
We need to ensure that our workplaces are safe and conducive, he said.
Otherwise, it wont help productivity or national progress.
On behalf of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Mr Enoch Cudjoe commended Ghana for aligning the new OSH Profile with ILO Conventions 155 and 187, which provide global frameworks for promoting safe and healthy workplaces.
This Profile serves as a foundation for developing a national OSH policy, Mr Cudjoe noted.
We are very pleased that Ghana has reached this stage, and we hope the effort continues until the policy and accompanying programme are fully enacted.
Delivering a presentation on the OSH Profile, Dr S. T. Odonkor, lead consultant on the project, described the document as a roadmap for reform.
He urged the government to consolidate existing occupational safety laws into a single legal framework and establish a National Occupational Safety and Health Authority with enforcement powers.
Acting Chief Labour Officer, Mr Dawuda Ibrahim Braimah, highlighted the significance of the new SOP for Ghanas fishing sector, describing it as the first of its kind in West Africa.
This framework will guide inspections and ensure that the rights and safety of fishers are respected, he said.
Ghana is proud to lead the sub-region in developing such a tool under the Convention.
The launch of the National OSH Profile and the SOP on the Work in Fishing Convention marks a defining moment in Ghanas occupational safety and health journey. It reinforces the governments commitment to building safer workplaces, protecting lives, and fostering sustainable productivity across all sectors.",,Health, 20 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Ghana-launches-first-OSH-profile-to-boost-workplace-safety-nationwide-2005890
"Dialysis center, new maternity block, and e-block projects near completion - Ashaiman MP","The Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ashaiman Constituency in the Greater Accra Region, Dr Ernest H Norgbey, has promptly taken steps to account for his activities over the past nine months under the new government and has communicated his future intentions to constituents through community engagement.
On October 14, 2025, representatives from various association groups, traditional leaders, political parties, youth organisations, and Christian groups converged at the St Augustine Roman Catholic Church in Ashaiman, eager to hear from the MP as he engaged in dialogue with them.
In his opening remarks to the electorate, the honourable Member of Parliament expressed his appreciation to the voters for the confidence they placed in the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) under the leadership of President John Dramani Mahama during last years election.
While outlining the key infrastructure projects completed in the constituency, the MP emphasised advancements in education, healthcare, road infrastructure, sanitation, and job creation.
He stated that 4000 students who completed the BECE in the Junior High Schools within the constituency and are set to enrol in senior high schools have received support in the form of mattresses, making this constituency the one with the highest number of beneficiaries from this initiative.
""When we examine other nearby constituencies in Greater Accra, it becomes evident that Ashaiman has the largest number of students transitioning to Senior High Schools annually. This indicates that I am assisting a greater number of students compared to other constituencies. Last year, the figure was at its lowest with 3,500 students,"" he enumerated.
He also stated that, following the directives of John Dramani Mahama, the work on the E-Blocks initiated by the NDC administration in the Ashaiman Constituency has commenced to create a conducive learning environment for the students of Ashaiman Technical Institute.
Dr Ernest H. Norgbey further remarked, We have completed an Assembly Hall for Ashaiman Senior High School to support the schools social activities. The current Government has allocated funds for educational projects within the constituency.
In addressing health issues, he highlighted the initiative to combat dialysis challenges in the country, which is part of the efforts towards the completion of the Municipal Dialysis Centre in the constituency, aimed at alleviating the burden on the limited centres available in the country.
The Agenda 111 is approaching its completion, which will act as an incentive to alleviate the workload at the Ashaiman Polyclinic. Additionally, I have advanced the phase and enhanced the facilities of the polyclinic by finalising a maternity block to provide comprehensive care for expectant mothers, he opened.
Regarding road infrastructure, he confirmed that contracts have been awarded to contractors for the completion of several essential inner roads within the constituency. Nevertheless, they will encounter a significant challenge in mobilising the substantial funds necessary for road construction.
Dr Ernest H Norgbey also emphasised the importance of crime reduction, stating, ""We are implementing 'Operation Let Ashaiman Bright,' ensuring that every street light pole is accompanied by a street light to improve visibility. I have already acquired some motorbikes for the police to enhance patrol efforts.""
In response to concerns about youth unemployment and job opportunities, he urged the youth to seize the chance to join the Community Police and the National Fire Services to mitigate their financial difficulties.
He affirmed that the government plans to introduce new projects annually in the constituency over the next four years, mentioning the initiative to build a modern market structure in the constituency with sufficient funding allocated for the completion of each project.
The Member of Parliament also shared details about his partnership with the Ashaiman Old Footballers Association to develop an astro turf featuring an athletic running track and seating capacity.
The Ghana Law Maker has lauded the proactive approach of the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) of Ashaiman Municipality, Freeman Tsekpo, for his timely execution of all projects within the constituency.
I am fortunate to have a proactive chief executive. My role is to handle the lobbying, while his role is to ensure implementation, and we are working well together, he remarked.

Breast cancer is not witchcraft; it can be treated - Dr Clementine Odei urges early detection,"Dr Clementine Odei, Head of the University of Ghana Medical School (UGMS) Clinic, has emphasised that breast cancer is not witchcraft but a medical condition that can be effectively treated if detected early.
She explained that individuals who seek early diagnosis and treatment can be cured and go on to live normal, healthy lives.
Dr Odei made this remark as the institution marked Pinktober with a blood donation and breast cancer awareness drive.
The event, held at the Basic Sciences and School of Public Health Nursing forecourts, forms part of the University of Ghana Medical Students Association (UGMSA) Health Committees annual initiative to promote breast cancer awareness and encourage blood donations to support patients at the Breast Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH).
She noted that October, globally recognised as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, is dedicated to educating the public on the importance of early detection and timely treatment.
We have opened our doors to not just staff and students at the University of Ghana but also the general public. Screening and awareness are essential because the earlier we detect breast cancer, the higher the chances of survival, she noted.
She further highlighted that the clinics partnership with the KBTH Breast Unit and the National Blood Service Ghana aims to ensure adequate blood supply for breast cancer patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy.
Sometimes, the disease itself reduces the level of blood in patients. This donation drive will help replenish what is needed for those going through treatment, she added.
Addressing the persistent stigma surrounding breast cancer, Dr Odei said cultural perceptions often discourage people from seeking screening.
Some people fear being labeled or worry that theyll lose their breast if diagnosed. But losing one breast is better than losing your life, she stressed.
She encouraged women to embrace regular self-examinations and professional screenings while reminding the public that men can also develop breast cancer, even though the percentage is low.

Dr Ing Octavia Otoo, another volunteer, emphasised the spirit of solidarity that characterizes the October campaign.
Usually in October, my siblings and I come together to support breast cancer patients. Were calling on everyone to donate in money, in kind or through blood because someone out there truly needs it, she said.
A blood donor also shared his experience, describing the process as quick and painless.
Everyone here is friendly and professional. Youll just get pricked once, have a meal after, and leave knowing you have saved a life. It is something you can even do with friends and family, he remarked.

The initiative, organised by the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly (KMA), targeted market women and traders to educate them on the dangers of breast cancer and the importance of early detection.
Addressing the gathering, Boadi highlighted the severity of cancer when left untreated, Cancer is like any other illness, but the difference is that if it is not detected early, it can destroy internal organs and result in death, he warned.
He urged women to take advantage of the global awareness month to get screened, adding, If your screening shows nothing, you are free to go about your work. But if something is found early, doctors can treat it before it worsens.
Boadi also expressed concern over the general attitude of Ghanaians toward healthcare, stressing that many people ignore health issues until they become critical.
He encouraged regular medical checkups as a preventive measure and reaffirmed the Assemblys commitment to promoting public health awareness.
Also speaking at the event, Priscilla Serwaah Bonsu, Senior Nursing Officer at the Breast Care Clinic of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), emphasised that fear often keeps women from seeking medical attention:
Not every lump is cancerous, but early detection is key. Many women stay away from the hospital out of fear, she noted.

It called on the government to take all necessary measures to halt the activities of galamsey, due to its dire consequences on childrens health.
Dr Hilda Mantebea Boye, President of the Paediatric Society of Ghana, told the Ghana News Agency in an interview that the urgent call to action in addressing the galamsey menace had become necessary due to the devastating impact on childrens health and the environment.
The menace is not only destroying water bodies and the environment but also claiming young lives, causing school dropouts, and exposing children to life-threatening diseases, she said.
Dr Boye explained that several reports had emerged about children drowning in abandoned mining pits filled with water, which are often mistaken for dry ground due to weeds covering their surfaces.
Some of these pits are left open after the miners leave, and the children sometimes play around them. Before you know it, a child has fallen in and drowned, she said.
The Paediatrician at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital also expressed concern about the growing number of children dropping out of school to join illegal mining operations, lured by the promise of quick money to support themselves and their families.
This not only threatens their education but also their health and future, she noted.
She noted that residents in galamsey-affected areas now struggle to access clean water, increasing diarrheal diseases and other waterborne infections, adding that health professionals were seeing more cases of diarrhoea due to the contaminated water people are forced to drink.
The Paediatric Society President added that pollution from mining chemicals such as mercury, arsenic, and lead could cause severe long-term health effects, including neurological disorders, autism, skin diseases, cancers, and kidney or liver failure.
Dr Boye referred to reports from the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, which recorded over 2,000 cases of kidney disease within the first half of 2025, a figure she described as worrying.
Although she cautioned that not all cases could be directly linked to galamsey, she indicated that the environmental pollution was a likely contributing factor and cited a recent study which found that 500 placentas of women who had miscarried contained high levels of mercury, particularly in areas around Sefwi and along the Pra and Ankobra Rivers, which are heavily polluted by illegal mining.
Dr Boye stressed that Ghana could not wait for decades of scientific evidence before taking action.
We already know that polluted water, soil, and food are harming us. Its time to act, not to wait for more data before doing the right thing. If we destroy the land, it will destroy us. The earth that feeds us will kill us if we continue this way, she emphasised.
She warned that the impact of galamsey extended beyond mining communities, as contaminated food and water were transported and consumed across the country, putting every Ghanaian at risk.
Dr Boye called on the government to take decisive and sustained measures to stop illegal mining, while providing alternative livelihoods for people engaged in the activity.
She urged Ghanaians to unite in ending galamsey, saying: All we need is to stand together and deal with this existential threat before its too late.",,Health, 17 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Save-our-children-from-galamsey-destruction-Paediatric-Society-2005676
Regular handwashing key to preventing infections - WaterAid Ghana,"WaterAid Ghana, a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) focused organisation, has underscored the importance of regular handwashing with soap as one of the most effective and affordable ways to prevent infections and safeguard public health.
It, therefore, urged Ghanaians to make handwashing a lifelong habit and part of the national culture, and to ensure that investment is made to encourage handwashing with soap under clean running water at all levels.
Speaking at a community durbar held at Chuchuliga in the Builsa North Municipality to mark Global Handwashing Day 2025, Ms Fauzia Aliu, the Advocacy, Campaigns and Inclusion Manager of WaterAid Ghana, said clean hands should not be seen as a privilege but as a basic right that every individual deserves.
Delivering remarks on behalf of Ms Ewurabena Yanyi-Akofur, the Country Director of WaterAid Ghana, Ms Aliu stressed that handwashing with soap at critical times, after using the toilet, before eating, and before handling food, remains a simple yet powerful action that saves lives.
Clean hands protect mothers and newborns, keep children in school, and uphold the dignity of every woman and girl, she said, adding that when we make handwashing a daily habit, we prevent infections and build healthier, stronger communities.
The event, held under the theme, Be a Handwashing Hero  Clean Hands Are Within Reach!, formed part of activities under the Sexual Health and Reproductive Education (SHARE) Project, implemented by a consortium led by Right to Play in partnership with WaterAid Ghana, FHI 360, and the Forum for African Women Educationalists Ghana (FAWE-Ghana), with funding from Global Affairs Canada.
Ms Aliu explained that through the SHARE Project, WaterAid Ghana and its partners are integrating hygiene, menstrual health, and sexual and reproductive health education in schools and communities, while empowering youth and womens groups to lead advocacy for hygiene financing and accountability.
She commended traditional authorities, teachers, and students for their continued efforts in promoting handwashing and positive hygiene practices and called on households, schools, and health facilities to maintain handwashing facilities and ensure they are used consistently.
Being a handwashing hero means taking responsibility, ensuring that facilities like tippy-taps and Veronica buckets are not just built for show but are maintained and used every day, she added.
The durbar, which brought together chiefs, queen mothers, women and youth groups, pregnant women, health workers, teachers, and students, among others, was organised in collaboration with the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA), the Builsa North Municipal Assembly, and the Ghana Health Service (GHS).
At the national level, the commemoration was held in collaboration with the Ministry of Works and Housing, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development.
Mr Cabral Bantiu, the Builsa North Municipal Director of the Ghana Health Service, stressed that most of the cases recorded at various health facilities could be reduced through regular handwashing with soap under running water.
He appealed to traditional authorities to use their influence to educate their subjects on the importance of handwashing, adding that a healthy population enhances productivity.
Ms Herbertta Simpson, Senior Extension Services Specialist, speaking on behalf of Mr. Emmanuel Oppong, the Acting Regional Director of the CWSA, urged women to lead the handwashing campaign since they and their children are more vulnerable to infections.
Nab Francis Akambegmi Asangalisah II, Chief of Chuchuliga, commended the efforts to promote hand hygiene among his subjects but appealed for greater investment in maternal and child health, particularly the construction of a childrens ward for the Chuchuliga Health Centre.",,Health, 17 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Regular-handwashing-key-to-preventing-infections-WaterAid-Ghana-2005674
ENT Professionals must be strategically positioned in districts across Ghana,"For early detection of infections of the ear, nose, and throat, authorities are calling for strategic positioning of professionals at health facilities to prevent complications.
Diseases affecting the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) are a global phenomenon with more than 1.5 billion people living with hearing loss.
Above 20 million people are afflicted with chronic otitis media, up to 40 percent suffering from allergic rhinitis, and 350,000 succumbing to head and neck cancer annually.
ENT diseases have become an important public health concern, where the Ghanaian health system has a significant challenge with the shortage of professional services.
The GRNMA reports that there are less than 50 ENT surgeons and a little over 400 ENT nurses in the country.
This shortfall is a critical issue as ENT diseases are among the most common reasons for visits to health facilities
Dr. Regina Darko Asante, an ENT Specialist, speaking at the 11th Annual Conference and Scientific Session of the Ear, Nose and Throat Nurses Society, Ghana in Kumasi, said when authorities invest in specialized nurses including ENT professionals, they are not just improving health outcomes but also building economic resilience.
Consider the economic burden of untreated ENT conditions. A child with chronic ear infections misses school, falls behind in education, and faces limited future opportunities. An adult with hearing loss struggles in the workplace, faces social isolation, and experiences reduced earning capacity.
A market trader with chronic sinusitis cannot work at full capacity, reducing both personal income and community economic activity, she emphasized.
Dr Asante said: but when ENT nurses are strategically positioned in districts across Ghana, early detection becomes possible.
She therefore called on stakeholders, especially the Ministry of Health and health administrators to prioritize the ENT nurse programme in resource allocation.
They must create sustainable funding mechanisms for continuing professional education.
She called on the GRNA to champion the cause of specialized nursing practice and ensure that ENT nurses had a strong voice in policy discussions.
They must advocate conditions that allow specialized nurses to practice to the full scope of their training, as well as supporting research that demonstrates the impact and cost-effectiveness of specialized nursing roles.
Mrs. Esther Birikorang, National Chairperson, Ear, Nose and Throat Nurses Society, Ghana, acknowledged the challenges of professionals stemming from resource limitations to evolving demands of modern healthcare, yet professionals continued to be resilient and resourceful in the discharge of their duties.
She re-echoed the Associations request for more ENT professionals to address the rising cases and the post COVID-19 impact on the healthcare delivery system.

"Over 6,000 Ghanaians died of breast cancer in 2022  Midwifery officer reveals","A midwifery officer at the Manhyia Government Hospital in the Asokore Mampong Municipality of the Ashanti Region, Ezzedin Memuna Muntaka, has disclosed that more than 6,700 people in Ghana died of breast cancer in 2022, out of an estimated 2.3 million affected globally by the disease.
Muntaka made the revelation during a breast cancer awareness walk held on Thursday, October 16, 2025, through some principal streets of the Kumasi Metropolis. The event was organised by the Manhyia Government Hospital in collaboration with the MEM Roots of Vitality Foundation to sensitise the public about the dangers of breast cancer and the importance of early detection.
Speaking to OTEC NEWS Reporters Esther Amankwah and Antoinette Ama Nyame after the exercise, Muntaka underscored the urgent need for regular screening and early treatment.
Statistics from 2022 show that about 6,700 people in Ghana lost their lives to breast cancer. This is alarming and must be taken seriously, she said.
A change in skin colour of the breast, the presence of a lump, or any unusual sensation should not be ignored. Early detection can save lives, so we urge everyoneespecially womento seek immediate medical attention if they notice any changes.
She further appealed to community leaders, churches, and schools to support regular health outreach programs to help curb the growing number of breast cancer cases.
Some participants at the event commended the hospital and its partners for organising the walk, which they said has equipped them with vital knowledge.
One participant, Farida Addams, expressed her appreciation:
I have learned a lot today. I now know the signs to look out for and the importance of going for check-ups. Ill also encourage my friends and family to do the same.
Another participant added:
This initiative has really opened our eyes. Sometimes we take these things for granted, but today weve been educated on how dangerous breast cancer can be.
The walk was part of activities marking Breast Cancer Awareness Month, observed globally every October to promote education, early screening, and support for those affected by the disease.",,Health, 17 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Over-6-000-Ghanaians-died-of-breast-cancer-in-2022-Midwifery-officer-reveals-2005650
"Akandoh explains why Agenda 111 projects, nurses' arrears were not in 2025 Budget","The Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, has explained that the 2025 Budget could not fully cover the Agenda 111 hospital projects and outstanding nurses salaries because it was a transitional budget designed to maintain government operations.
Speaking on UTV on Friday, October 17, 2025, and monitored by GhanaWeb, he stated that, ""The budget we did was a transition one. It could not cover everything, including the Agenda 111 hospital projects and the salaries of unpaid nurses. But we ask Ghanaians to be reasonable and patient with us because the NDC government is here to address all these issues.

He assured the public that the government remains committed to completing all ongoing health infrastructure projects, including the reconstruction of the La General Hospital.
Mintah Akandoh further disclosed that GH130 million had been allocated for the hospital.
The NDC government could not abandon the project. By the close of this week, or next week, the funds would be released for La General Hospital, he added.
Meanwhile President
John Dramani Mahama
has disclosed that his administration will require $1.7 billion to complete all unfinished Agenda 111 hospital projects.
He made the disclosure during a meeting with the Christian Council on February 24, 2025.
Now we need 1.7 billion US dollars to complete the Agenda 111 projects, the previous government started Agenda 111 but has not been able to finish the hospitals. There are so many of them unfinished. Even the ones they commissioned dont have a single bed"", he said.

The president suggested that religious organisations collaborate with the government to support the completion of some of these stalled projects.
If the missions have a hospital in an area, we are not coming to compete with the missions by building a hospital. We will use the resources to improve the mission hospitals so that they can provide the service, he said.
He also proposed that interested missions could take on the completion and management of some of the unfinished hospitals.
The Agenda 111 project was initiated by the Nana Addo-Dankwa Akufo-Addo government to address gaps in healthcare infrastructure and administration across the country.

Korle Bu is Africas pride  Ameer of Ahmadiyya Mission declares,"The Ameer of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, Maulvi Mohammed Bin Salih, has described the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) as one of Africas most prestigious health institutions, saying it is not just Ghanas pride  it is Africas pride.
He noted that many doctors and specialists across the continent have passed through the institution, underscoring its enduring legacy in medical education and specialised care.
The Ameer made the remark when a delegation from the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital paid a courtesy call on the leadership of the Mission at its headquarters in Osu, Accra.
Speaking on behalf of the Chief Executive, Dr Yakubu Seidu Adams, the Director of Administration, Munir Alhassan, said the visit formed part of efforts to reach out to strategic institutions to deepen the hospitals partnership in areas such as medical outreach services, training, and the provision of premium healthcare services.
Maulvi Bin Salih commended the hospitals goodwill, humility, and commitment to building strategic partnerships aimed at improving national healthcare delivery.
He emphasised the need for empathy and respect in patient care, saying, We need to restore empathy in our healthcare services and ensure that every patient is treated with dignity.
The Ameer also spoke candidly about challenges confronting Ghanas health system, including poor maintenance culture, corruption, and the persistent brain drain affecting the healthcare workforce. He urged health professionals to view their work as a calling rather than merely a career.
Ghana has been blessed with great human resources, but we must harness them properly, he said.
He further proposed the introduction of VIP medical services at KBTH to provide high-quality, expedited care for patients who might otherwise seek treatment abroad. We must make it possible for Ghanaians to have world-class healthcare right here at home, he added.
A Deputy Ameer of the Mission and retired Justice of the Court of Appeal, Justice Alhajj Saeed Kwaku Gyan, praised KBTH for its long-standing service to the nation, describing it as a symbol of excellence and compassion.
When people talk about hospitals, Korle Bu comes to mind, he said. Its reassuring to know that we are indeed together in the healthcare system.
The meeting concluded with the Ameer presenting gifts to the KBTH delegation as a gesture of goodwill and to symbolise the enduring partnership between the two institutions.
The Korle Bu delegation was led by the Director of Administration, who represented the Chief Executive Officer, Dr Yakubu Seidu Adams.

AHPC introduces computer-based testing for licensing exams from October,"The Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC) has announced the launch of a computer-based testing (CBT) system for its professional licensing examinations, starting this October.
The new digital system replaces the traditional paper-based format and will enable candidates to take their exams on a secure electronic platform.
According to the Council, this innovation is designed to deliver faster results, minimise marking errors, and enhance examination security.
In a statement issued in Accra and signed by the Registrar, Dr Shirazu Issahaku, the Council explained that the transition marks a major step toward improving fairness, transparency, and efficiency in the licensing process while aligning with international best practices.
It is the same examination in terms of content and standards but now administered through a secure computer-based platform.
Questions will appear on-screen, and candidates will enter their responses directly into the system, the statement said.
The AHPC further clarified that all Allied Health graduates from accredited institutions who meet the Councils eligibility criteria may apply to take the licensing examination.
Examinations, it noted, are not conducted daily but according to a fixed schedule published on the Councils website and social media pages.
The main computer-based licensing exam will be held once a year in October, with a supplementary session organised annually for candidates who do not pass all their papers during the main sitting.
The Council assured candidates and stakeholders of a smooth transition to the new testing format and pledged to provide appropriate practice tools to support effective preparation ahead of the rollout in this month.",,Health, 17 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/AHPC-introduces-computer-based-testing-for-licensing-exams-from-October-2005551

In an official post on X on October 15, 2025, the service indicated that two patients are currently on admission, while three deaths have been recorded so far.
Mpox is a viral disease transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person, animal, or contaminated material.
Ghana's MPOX cases rise to 670 with three deaths
It presents with symptoms such as rash, fever, headaches, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes.
The GHS advises the public to wash hands often with soap under running water or use hand sanitizers, especially before or after touching sores.
Wash your hands with soap under running water especially before and after touching sores, it stated.
It also urged the public to wear masks and cover lesions when around other people until the rash heals, adding that the skin must be kept dry and uncovered.
The Ghana Health Service advised that anyone experiencing these symptoms should visit the nearest health facility immediately.
In August 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared MPOX a public health emergency of international concern, its highest level of alert, due to a new variant of the viral disease in Africa.
Presently, cases have been found in more than 13 African countries, and its new form is spreading.
It is the second time in two years that the WHO has issued an alert for the disease.
Ghana records 13 new mpox cases, total infections rise to 670
As of 2024, more than 17,000 suspected Mpox cases and 517 deaths were reported on the African continent, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The WHO, also in 2024, approved the use of an Mpox vaccine for the first time, which it said should facilitate ""timely and increased access"" for millions at risk in Africa, where the latest outbreak has infected more than 20,000.

In an interview on Channel One TV on October 15, 2025, Mintah Akandoh noted that the country is likely to face about 180,000 unemployed trained health professionals by the end of 2028, if urgent steps are not taken.
He explained that the current unemployed health professionals in the country stands at around 74,000, adding that the figure is likely to shoot up yearly since more students are yet to graduate.
""By the end of 2026, we will have an additional 23,000. By the end of 2027, we have an additional 35,000. By the end of 2028, we have about 47,000. So, by the end of 2028, if we dont employ anybody, this 74,000 is still outstanding, we will have not less than 180,000 trained and they will be at home, he said.
Mintah Akandoh additionally noted that the government is partnering with other countries to adopt what he referred to as ""managed migration,"" a policy which will see to it that the majority of Ghana's backlog health professionals are employed by other countries.

So, there is a strategy going forward. What we are seeking to do now is that gradually, the government will be employing some of them as we move along.
We are also looking at what we call managed migration  how we will be able to export some of them. About 13 countries have responded, but the difficulty is that most of these countries that have responded need specialists, he added.

Govt to privatise hospital equipment procurement and maintenance  Health minister,"The Minister of Health,
Kwabena Mintah Akandoh
, has hinted that the government will soon privatise the procurement, management and maintenance of hospital equipment across the country as part of efforts to improve efficiency and sustainability in the health sector.
Speaking at the 2nd Annual Scientific Conference of the Medical Superintendents Group in Abetifi-Kwahu on Tuesday, October 14, the minister said the new model will allow private entities with direct links to equipment manufacturers to supply, maintain, and manage medical devices for health facilities, while government health professionals operate them.
We know standard equipment for each regional hospital, and we know standard equipment for each Teaching hospital. And therefore, well float it. So, people who are interested and have direct relationships with manufacturers of equipment would then bid to go through the processes. We dedicate, lets say, Juaboso District Hospital to you. You put all the equipment there, he said.
He added, ""When the equipment is faulty, you will fix it. You monitor them. But our health workers will run the equipment. That is how we are going to pay them. So that equipment will not be a challenge for the government. So they will run the equipment, but you will be doing the labs and what have you.
The minister further disclosed that payments to vendors will be made through the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) by restructuring the current claims system.
This is how we are going to pay them. We have realised that the claims you submit to National Health Insurance have three main components. The services, the consulting, the medications and the diagnosis. I hope Im not lying. Very good. If that is the case, we are going to take out the diagnosis aspect. And so therefore, well pay the vendor who has placed the equipment in the facilities and will not tolerate that I dont have the capacity to put this equipment there.
He said there will be profit profit-sharing arrangement under the proposed model.
Again, Ill be quick to add that there will be a certain level of profit-sharing arrangement with the facilities. These are things we are considering. We have to use our brains.
Akandoh noted that the new approach is aimed at eliminating persistent equipment breakdowns and shortages and ensuring regular maintenance to guarantee quality healthcare delivery.
Government buying equipment all the time is not sustainable. We must think differently. Criticisms are welcome, but we must innovate if we want better results, he said.
Dialysis Equipment to Be Outsourced
Addressing issues of inadequate dialysis equipment in the country, the Health Minister, Mintah Akandoh, said the government is in the process of outsourcing dialysis equipment supply and maintenance through an equipment placement model beginning with all Teaching and Regional Hospitals across the country.
What the government is doing is that we are outsourcing and doing what we call equipment placement. We have advertised it, 47 companies have applied, we are doing the shortlisting and by the close of next week, we will conclude which companies we will deal with. So we will divide the whole country into lots. To start with, we are going to start with the regional hospitals and the teaching hospitals.""
He added that under the new arrangement, vendors will provide and maintain dialysis machines, supply reagents, while health professionals operate them. Payments will then be made through NHIS tariffs.
So, what we will do is that you put your equipment at the facility, you maintain it, you buy your own reagents, our health professionals will run the equipment, and then the national health insurance will pay you for the tariffs. Truth be told, government buying equipment all the time is not sustainable. That is the gospel truth.

"Police officers donate blood to save colleague, support Bole Hospital","A routine patrol operation by the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Special Operations Team in Bole on Tuesday October 14, 2025, turned into a humanitarian act when officers voluntarily donated blood to save a colleague and support the local hospitals blood bank.
The operation, led by DSP Karim Mahama and ASP Bawah Abdul Jalil, formed part of ongoing peace-building and law enforcement efforts within Bole Township and its environs.
A total of 70 personnel, supported by six service vehicles and ten motorbikes, were deployed to ensure effective coverage of the area.
The team assembled at 9:00 a.m., where officers were briefed on professionalism, vigilance and teamwork before setting out.
Shortly after the patrol began, the team learned that one of their colleagues had been admitted to the Bole District Hospital and was in urgent need of a blood transfusion.
Accrdoing to a police statement, ""Medical officials disclosed that the officers blood volume had dropped to 3.8 liters, well below the normal level of 11 liters, posing a serious health risk.
""With limited blood available at the hospital, only one unit could initially be administered. In response, the leadership of the Special Operations Team made an immediate call for voluntary blood donation among personnel.""
The statement added, ""All deployed officers volunteered to donate blood, an act that not only helped their colleague but also replenished the hospitals dwindling blood supply.""
The Bole District Hospital Administration expressed appreciation to the police team, noting that voluntary blood donation remains a persistent challenge in the community.
Hospital officials described the officers gesture as a selfless and life-saving contribution that would benefit multiple patients beyond the police service.
ASP Bawah Abdul Jalil reiterated the teams commitment to maintaining peace and security in the Bole area.
He noted that the blood donation exemplifies the police services broader mission and not only to protect lives and property but also to uphold the spirit of humanity and community support.

Cooking fuels in SHS kitchens impact adversely  Study,"Cooking fuels used in the kitchens of Senior High Schools (SHSs) in Ghana affect air quality and have adverse health effects on an estimated half a million people in high school settings, a Study has shown.
The Study identifies levels of emissions of particulate matter and some gaseous pollutants  carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide in the kitchen spaces after sampling SHSs using cook stoves in the Kumasi Metropolis.
Prof Marian Asantewah Nkansah, the Lead Researcher and a Professor of Environmental Chemistry, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, said the team identified four cook stoves  traditional cook stoves, biomass, briquette, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the selected schools.
Speaking at an Annual Lecture in the Sciences 2025, themed: Fuel for Thought: The Impact of Cooking Fuels on High School Kitchen Air Quality, at the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, she said the emission levels of the pollutants in the kitchen spaces were above the threshold limits of the World Health Organisation (WHO) with the exception of an isolated case of LPG which was just for the particulate matter.
All four cook stoves had levels above the threshold, and people exposed to these pollutants will suffer from non-carcinogenic effects. WHO has a standard level for every pollutant that the body can tolerate. So when it goes beyond that level, it means the person in that space is likely to suffer some health effects, the Professor said.
She said the threshold always varied from pollutant to pollutant, adding that when the air quality index was also computed from the pollutants, it was ranked between hazardous to moderate for all the cookstoves.
So even with the LPG, its not as safe as we may expect in terms of use in the kitchen spaces. From the study, we determined particulate matter, which comes in PM 2.5, PM 10, and then gaseous pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide were found, the Lead Researcher added.
The US Environmental Protection Agency says particulate matter (PM), also known as particle pollution, is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye.
Other particles, it says, are so small and can only be detected using an electron microscope. Particle pollution includes PM10, inhalable particles with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller, and PM2.5, fine inhalable particles with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.
Prof Nkansah said: Exposure to smoke and the emissions results in eye irritation, respiratory illnesses, and breathing-related diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Indoor pollution is a major health risk in the 21st century, accounting for 80 per cent of human exposure to air pollutants and contributing to approximately 4 million premature deaths worldwide.
Commercial and institutional kitchens in countries like Ghana are among one-fourth of those global rely on solid fuels for various cooking activities. National efforts in Ghana to eradicate hunger in educational settings have transformed high school kitchens into one of the largest in the country, she said.
Prof Nkansah said that despite the risks of acute and chronic exposure to indoor pollutants, the knowledge, perception, and awareness (KPA) of indoor air pollution in high school kitchens remained critically low or less documented.
She said tackling the impact of cooking fuel on air quality in high school kitchens demanded a collaborative strategy where school management, parents, teacher associations, Ghana Education Service, local communities, energy suppliers, health professionals, and kitchen staff operated within a unified framework.
It is solely through these that the destructive cycle of poor kitchen air quality can be broken and a path towards healthy and sustainable school kitchen environments can be achieved, the Professor said.",,Health, 14 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Cooking-fuels-in-SHS-kitchens-impact-adversely-Study-2005165
Mental Health Officer urges support for people with mental health conditions,"Moses Suonyir Dari, the Wa West District Mental Health Officer, has called on the public to show care and support to persons living with mental health conditions to help them recover and live productive lives.
He said mental illness should be treated like any other form of sickness and not as a punishment, curse, or moral failing, stressing that stigmatisation only worsens the condition of affected persons.
Mr Dari made the call at Meteu in the Wa West District at the weekend during a programme organised by the Innovations for Sustainable Rural Development (ISRuDeV) to mark this years World Mental Health Day.
The event, which attracted traditional leaders, healthcare workers, and scores of community members, mostly women, formed part of ISRuDeVs efforts to promote the health and well-being of rural communities, particularly women and youth groups it worked with.
Mr Dari observed that many people still attributed mental illness to drug abuse or anti-social behaviour such as theft, which influenced their attitudes towards people with mental health disorders.
He added that discrimination and name-calling further worsen the condition of affected persons and hindered their recovery.
He noted that although there were many trained psychiatric nurses in the country ready to provide care and treatment, the lack of essential drugs for mental health remained a major challenge to effective service delivery.
The problem in Ghana is that policymakers do not put much premium on mental health. The government seems to focus more on physical health than on mental well-being, the Mental Health Officer stated.
Mr Dari, therefore, appealed to the government to adequately fund mental health programmes and ensure the regular supply of medication at all levels of healthcare delivery.
He also urged stakeholders, including traditional leaders, healthcare professionals, and politicians, to collaborate in providing adequate treatment and care for persons with mental health conditions.
Mr Dari further called on families to desist from inhumane practices such as chaining people with mental health disorders in homes or prayer camps, and said such acts worsened their conditions and violated their human rights.
Mr Anacetus Banakoma, the Daffiama-Bussie-Issa District Mental Health Officer, expressed concern about the increasing rate of substance abuse in rural communities, which he said had serious implications for the mental health of users.
He cited instances where some men, women, and youth had resorted to abusing snuff (locally known as inye), with some women reportedly inserting the substance into their private parts for sexual pleasure.
He cautioned that such practices could lead to severe health complications, including mental health disorders and vaginal sores, and urged the public to desist from them.
Maxwell Kpetaah, the Business Development Manager at ISRuDeV, reiterated the organisations commitment to promoting mental health awareness and supporting the well-being of rural populations, particularly women and young people.

Galamsey threatens spike in breast cancer cases - Breast Society warns,"The Breast Society of Ghana has sounded the alarm on a looming surge in the incidence of breast cancer in Ghana as the menace of illegal mining (galamsey) continues to ravage many communities across the country.
It indicated that an average of 5,000 women were diagnosed with the disease every year, out of which 2,500 died, but the situation could deteriorate if the galamsey onslaught did not cease immediately.
Prof Martin Morna, an Associate Professor with the School of Medical Sciences (SMS) of the University of Cape Coast (UCC) and member of the Society, warned that mercury, lead, arsenic, and other chemicals introduced into water bodies and the soil were carcinogenic and could increase the susceptibility of women to breast cancer.
The Society issued the warning when it held a grand durbar on breast cancer awareness in Cape Coast, sensitising mostly second-cycle students to the fatal disease and mounting a strong advocacy against stigmatisation.
The durbar highlighted the devastating dangers of breast disease and called for love and support for victims, instead of stigma and ostracisation.
The mammoth gathering was held under the Societys Empowerment Project as part of its 13th Oguaa Breast Cancer Campaign on the theme: Breast cancer: Stop the stigma and be supportive.
Prof Morna underscored the dangers of the disease, noting that cancer cells could invade other organs and parts of the body, including the bone, brain, and liver, and cause them to fail.
He said the disease could happen to anybody, but factors such as age, gender, race, family history, smoking, nulliparity, contraception, and delaying the first birth until 30 years increased the risk of getting it.
He said early signs of the disease included bloody or blackish discharge from the breast, adding that the early signs were usually not painful or bothersome.
Anyone who goes beyond 40 years and finds a lump in their breast should quickly see the doctor, he said.
It is good to do screening regularly; do it once every two years if you are at average risk, and once every year if you are at high risk, he added.
Prof Akwasi Anyanful, Former Vice President of the Society and Associate Professor with UCC SMS, painted a global picture of the breast cancer disease, noting that 2.3 million cases were recorded in 2022 alone, out of which 665,000 succumbed.
He observed with worry that the incidence of breast cancer was higher among Caucasians, but mortality was higher among blacks.
He also observed that breast cancer could also affect men, adding that men died faster when affected.
Breast cancer is no respecter of persons, and let us all be advocates of breast cancer. Let us let the world know that early detection saves lives, he said.
Mrs Georgina Kumah-Dzagah, a survivor of breast cancer, shared her experience with the disease and how she suffered stigma at the hands of friends and family.
She said she had gone through all the stages of the disease, including lumpectomy, mastectomy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy, even though she detected the disease at an early stage.
The deepest wound doesnt come from the cancer but how people respond to it. I was 31 years old when I was diagnosed, and my world changed in an instance.
I didnt just lose my breast, I lost friends. Social gatherings became more painful because people looked at my chest instead of my face, she recounted.
She emphasised that breast cancer was real but not contagious, urging people to be more supportive of patients.
Prof Rofela Combey, Provost of the College of Agriculture and Natural Sciences, UCC, who chaired the gathering, also shared her experience with caring for a breast cancer patient and how much stigma he suffered.
He was initially diagnosed with malaria and high fever, but we later found out it was breast cancer, she recalled.
The day we become more human, the world will be a better place. The pain may be real, but love will make it bearable, she added.
Prof Georgina Yaa Oduro, the Head of the Sociology and Anthropology Department at UCC, led the Society to launch a book on breast cancer dubbed Breast Cancer: Diagnosis, Treatment, Facts and Myths.
The book uses pictures, illustrations, and simple language to explain breast cancer, how it comes, and how it can be fought.
Copies of the book were distributed to various institutions and groups, including health facilities, security services, and Senior High Schools.
Prof Oduro commended the Breast Society of Ghana for its consistent advocacy and support for breast cancer patients in Ghana.
The Breast Society of Ghana later embarked on breast cancer awareness and health walks through some principal streets of Cape Coast.
More than 700 Senior High School students, security personnel, and other professionals joined the Society in the walk to educate and sensitize the public to the disease.
The walk culminated in an aerobics session at Victoria Park.",,Health, 14 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Galamsey-threatens-spike-in-breast-cancer-cases-Breast-Society-warns-2005110
All you need to know about Ghana's historic HPV vaccination drive,"Ghana made history on Tuesday, October 7, 2025, by introducing the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into its national immunisation programme to protect girls aged nine to 14 years from cervical cancer.
It was previously introduced in 2013 with a three-dose schedule, but it is now administered as a lifetime single dose to protect against high-risk HPV types that cause cervical cancer and genital warts.
Human Papillomavirus
According to the World Health Organisation, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the name of a group of 200 known viruses.
Although it does not cause concerns in most people, infection with some high-risk types is common and can cause genital warts or cancer.
The nationwide exercise
The five-day campaign, which ran from October 7 to 11, 2025, was carried out mainly in schools across all regions, while health facilities served as vaccination points for girls who were not in school.
GHS begins vaccination against HVP nationwide
It targeted over 2.5 million young girls across the country.
Implemented with support from the Ministry of Education, the WHO, UNICEF, and other key partners, the initiative marked a major milestone in Ghanas fight against cervical cancer.
During the campaign, trained health workers administered the HPV vaccine in two doses, given several months apart, to ensure maximum protection.
The Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh  also gave the assurance that the vaccines are safe.
Let me assure you that this HPV vaccine is safe, effective, and Ghana is not the first country to administer the vaccine. At best, we are joining other African countries like Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana, he said.
Over 30,000 girls to be vaccinated against HPV in Kumasi
Vaccinations were given across schools, health facilities, and community centres, ensuring that as many eligible girls as possible were reached.
The HPV vaccine was provided free of charge under Ghanas Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), supported by the government, Gavi, and the WHO.
According to the Ghana Health Service, the HPV vaccine offers lifelong protection against the virus.
It also aligns with global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health threat reflecting the governments long-term commitment to strengthening preventive healthcare and reducing cancer-related deaths among women.
Now, our vaccination is going to be a single-dose vaccination. So, when you get it once, you will be protected for life, the Acting Greater Accra Regional Director of the GHS, Dr Robert Amesiya explained.
With this milestone, Ghana joins a growing number of African countries taking proactive steps to protect young girls and future generations from cervical cancer.
After the mass vaccination campaign, HPV, which prevents cervical cancer accountable for almost 2,000 deaths annually, will become part of the countrys routine vaccination schedule.

'Eye for Cancer' campaign focuses on early detection and support for patients,"The Dorothys Hope Foundation has once again championed the fight against breast cancer through its annual Eye for Cancer awareness event, now in its 11th edition.
The initiative, which took off from the Cantonments Post Office in Accra at 6:00 am on October 11, 2025, brought together hundreds of participants for a health-focused walk, free breast and general health screening and a blood donation drive to support breast cancer patients.
The Eye for Cancer initiative aims to encourage early detection, raise awareness and provide crucial support to individuals battling breast cancer.
Participants received free breast cancer screenings and other medical checks at the end point of the walk.
In addition, a blood drive was organized to aid patients undergoing cancer treatment who often require blood transfusions during chemotherapy.
Speaking at the event, Dorothy Amuah Niamkey, Founder of the Dorothys Hope Foundation and herself a breast cancer survivor, shared her personal journey and the motivation behind her advocacy.
If youre unfortunately diagnosed with the disease, we act as a support system, she explained.
Ghana says 'no' to cervical cancer with free HPV vaccine for girls
We support patients mentally and emotionally, and where possible, financially. We have a survivors network that visits hospitals to encourage and counsel newly diagnosed patients, sharing their own experiences and helping them understand what to expect through chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
She added that she personally volunteers at hospitals regularly to mentor and comfort patients navigating the difficult stages of breast cancer treatment.
Over the years, Dorothy has become a beacon of hope for many women and families affected by breast cancer in Ghana.

"UNICEF, FDA study reveals widespread lead contamination in Ghanaian products","A recent joint study by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) and the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has revealed alarming levels of lead contamination in several everyday products in Ghana exposing children and pregnant women to severe health risks.
The nationwide study, which sampled consumer products from all 16 regions, found significant traces of lead, a toxic heavy metal in commonly used items such as traditional cosmetics, food condiments, and household materials.
This was announced in a released statement by UNICEF in Accra.
Lead, though naturally occurring and widely used in industrial processes such as battery production, paint, and ceramics, is highly poisonous.
Health experts warn that even minimal exposure can cause irreversible damage to the brain and vital organs especially among children, pregnant women, and women of childbearing age.
The study identified traditional eyeliner, locally known as kaji kaji or kholi, as one of the most contaminated items with about 80 per cent of tested samples containing dangerously high lead levels, some exceeding permissible limits by tens of thousands.
The study suggested that cosmetics were often applied to childrens eyes by mothers, believing it enhances brightness and beauty.
It also saw another common source of exposure as white baked clay, locally referred to as shire, ayilor, or farinkasa, which was widely consumed by pregnant women to ease nausea.
The study revealed that 24.6% of samples contained lead, with the North East and Greater Accra Regions recording the highest contamination rates.
In the food category, turmeric powder and the local cereal mix tom brown were also found to contain unsafe levels of lead.
The study also said about 42% of turmeric samples tested positive for high contamination, especially in the Greater Accra (84.52%), Central (75%), and Bono (60.5%) Regions.
Similarly, 4.4% of tom brown samples, mostly from the Eastern Region, showed elevated levels of lead.
The report further highlighted that old plumbing systems and cookware also contributed to lead exposure as the metal could leach into drinking water or be inhaled during cooking.
According to UNICEF, the findings presented an urgent call for coordinated national action to protect the health and development of Ghanaian children.
The organization urged government agencies and stakeholders to take immediate steps to raise public awareness about the dangers of lead in traditional cosmetics and foods, strengthen regulatory enforcement to improve product safety, and promote routine screening for lead exposure especially among children and pregnant women.
UNICEF reaffirmed its commitment to working with the Government of Ghana and partners to eliminate lead exposure and safeguard the wellbeing of children across the country.",,Health, 14 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/UNICEF-FDA-study-reveals-widespread-lead-contamination-in-Ghanaian-products-2005018
"Korle Klottey MCE urges regular HIV testing, safe sex practices","Alfred Allotey-Gaisie, Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), Korle Klottey Municipal Assembly, has urged Ghanaians to make Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing a regular part of their healthcare routine.
He also encouraged the public to practise safe sex to help curb the rising cases of HIV infections within the Municipality and across the country.
Allotey-Gaisie made the call at the launch of a two-month HIV sensitisation campaign in Accra on the theme: Your Body, Your Choice, Your Protection.
The campaign, which runs from October 10 to December 10, 2025, is a collaborative effort between the Korle Klottey Municipal Assembly and partners, including the Ghana AIDS Commission, Ghana Health Service, Ghana HIV & AIDS Network (GHANET), Ghana Education Service, and Hope for Future Generations (HFFG).
Other partners are the West African Project to Combat AIDS and STIs (WAPCAS), ARACO Construction Limited, Jekora Ventures Limited, and lorry terminal and market stakeholders.
The campaign launch was held alongside a health screening exercise for residents within and beyond the Municipality, focusing on blood pressure, blood sugar, breast cancer, and HIV testing, among others.
The MCE noted that public discussion on HIV had declined in recent years, leading to complacency among residents, especially the youth.
It seems people have taken HIV for granted because theres not much talk about it these days. But the statistics show clearly that the disease is still with us, and Korle Klottey has been marked as one of the high-prevalence areas, he said.
He reaffirmed the Assemblys commitment to improving public health and promoting responsible sexual behaviour through continuous education and collaboration with health agencies.
Allotey-Gaisie said the sensitisation campaign formed part of broader efforts to reduce HIV infections and encourage residents, particularly the youth, to take advantage of free HIV testing and counselling services during the two-month exercise.
He said while antiretroviral drugs helped control the virus, prevention remained the most effective approach.
Protection is always better than cure. I would advise the youth to check their status regularly and practise safe sex if they are not married. It is their choice, but that choice must be guided by wisdom. They should not be ashamed to buy condoms because it is a responsible decision to protect themselves and their partners, he added.
He said the Assembly, through its health and education units, had integrated HIV and sexual health education into its annual programmes for schools and community groups to promote sustained awareness.
Madam Antoinette Opoku, HIV Focal Person at the Korle Klottey Municipal Assembly, said the campaign theme was developed after consultations among the Assemblys AIDS, Health, and Security Committees, following rising reports of HIV cases, drug abuse, and related social issues among young adults.
She said the campaign aimed to address stigma and empower individuals to take charge of their health.
The theme, Your Body, Your Choice, Your Protection, reflects our goal to promote personal responsibility and holistic wellbeing. We are integrating discussions on HIV, drug abuse, cervical cancer, and mental health because these issues are interconnected, she said.
Madam Opoku said the campaign would be implemented in two zones Adabraka and Osu through school and community-based activities such as health talks, free screening and testing, condom distribution, and open forums on responsible sexual behaviour and digital safety.
Data collected from schools and communities would be used to evaluate the programmes impact, with plans to establish HIV awareness clubs in schools to sustain education and peer mentoring.
To ensure sustainability, she said the Assembly was collaborating with GHANET, WAPCAS, HFFG, DKT International, and the Ghana Health Service to provide technical and logistical support.
She added that the campaign would also include screenings for hepatitis B, tuberculosis, and breast cancer, alongside mental health awareness.
Madam Opoku appealed to development partners, corporate institutions, and benevolent organisations to support the campaign to expand its reach beyond the pilot phase.
According to recent data from the Ghana AIDS Commission, the Korle Klottey Municipality has an HIV prevalence rate of 11.3 per cent, one of the highest in the country a situation that underscores the need for intensified sensitisation and testing.
The two-month campaign aims to raise awareness about HIV transmission, encourage regular testing, and promote safe sexual practices while reducing stigma and discrimination.

Community unites to fight breast cancer in Dansoman,"Residents of Dansoman in the Greater Accra Region have joined forces with health workers and local organizations to raise awareness about breast cancer and encourage early detection through free public screenings.
A nurse from Osudoku Hospital, Madam Beatrice, urged community members to make regular checkups a priority, stressing that early detection saves lives.
Breast cancer is not contagious and it can be cured when it is found early, she said.
So, if you notice anything wrong with your breast, dont be afraid or wait go for screening and get treatment.
The campaign, organized by Implementers on behalf of the Prebbie Group a consortium that includes TECHAiDE formed part of activities marking Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October.
It brought health education to the streets of Dansoman, aiming to support both patients and survivors.
Communications and Engagement Manager of Implementers, Blessing Okam, said the outreach was intended to educate men and women alike about breast cancer and emphasize the importance of regular checks.
We came to Dansoman to show love to people receiving treatment for breast cancer and to remember those we have lost, she said.
No one should face this alone. Apart from creating awareness, we also want to support survivors and patients because cancer can happen to anyone.
The days activities included a community walk, free screenings and the distribution of educational materials and souvenirs.
Mary Addison, one of the participants, expressed appreciation for the initiative and encouraged women to take early detection seriously.
I was confident I was fine, but I still came for the screening because early detection is important, she said.
The event brought together residents, corporate representatives and health professionals, all united by a common goal to raise awareness and extend support to those affected by breast cancer.
The Prebbie Group is made of companies which include, (Techaide, IMPLEMENTERS, Shellbie Homes, Ecorefix and Prebbie Properties) undertook this campaign as part of their CSR activities.

Parental resistance hampers HPV vaccination in Yilo Krobo,"Health officials in Yilo Krobo say some parents are stopping their daughters from receiving the free Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, threatening efforts to protect girls aged nine to 14 years from cervical cancer.
The Yilo Krobo Municipal Health Directorate in the Eastern Region raised the concern during a municipality-wide vaccination campaign, targeting basic and Junior High Schools (JHS) as part of a national effort to prevent HPV infections.
Ms Hannah Danquah, a Municipal Public Health Nurse, during a community engagement organised by the Yilo Krobo Municipal Assembly, said the resistance became evident when some girls refused the vaccine, citing parental instructions.
When we probed further, the girls said their parents cautioned them not to take the vaccines, she said.
She stated that while some parents cited peculiar illness as a reason for their rejection of the vaccine, others gave no clear justification.
She said the Directorate aimed to vaccinate over 8,000 girls in the municipality, but about 2,000 received the vaccine on the first day, and indicated that, though the number of resistant parents was relatively small, officials are worried that the number was significant enough to raise concern.
Ms Danquah said health workers had tried engaging parents to explain the vaccines safety and importance, but some remain unconvinced.
We want to cover all children from ages nine to 14 years. We are trying to address it by engaging school heads to continue to educate parents to allow us to vaccinate the children, she said.
She emphasised that the HPV vaccine was safe, free, and globally approved, having been tested in several countries and proven effective in preventing HPV infections, the leading cause of cervical cancer and genital warts.
If we dont vaccinate our children, especially those from nine to 14 years, we fear that when they begin sexual activity in a few years, they will be exposed to the HPV virus, she cautioned.
Ms Danquah also stressed the importance of early detection and prevention of cervical cancer, noting that women should ideally be screened at ages 21, 35, and 45.
However, many women do not undergo regular screening and often detect the disease too late.
If the girls are not vaccinated and later get exposed to the HPV virus, they could suffer from serious health complications, including conditions that may require the removal of the uterus, she warned.
She urged parents to trust the health system and cooperate with health officials to ensure their daughters were protected.
The vaccines are reliable, safe, and effective. They have been tested and proven to work, she said.
The Directorate reaffirmed its commitment to achieving full coverage of the HPV vaccination campaign in the municipality and believed that continuous public education and community engagement with parents, school authorities, and opinion leaders were crucial to increasing vaccine acceptance.
Meanwhile, health officials are intensifying community sensitisation efforts to dispel myths and misinformation surrounding vaccination.
Vaccine hesitancy remains a persistent challenge in parts of the Krobo area.

Gender director calls on individuals to prioritise mental health,"The Western Regional Director for the Department of Gender, Maribel Akuorkor Okine, has advised the public to prioritise their own mental well-being.
She also called for support for each other in times of challenges or personal struggles, to avoid the degeneration of mental health issues.
The Director for Gender, who advised in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at Sekondi in the Western Region, stressed that Lets prioritise our mental well-being and support one another. If youre struggling, dont hesitate to seek help from professional hands.
She indicated that stigma and neglect of affected persons continued to be a great worry in caring for such persons ... Lets work together to break down stigma and promote a culture that values emotional expression, vulnerability, and support for all.
Madam Okine explained that when it came to gender issues in mental health, societal expectations could impact both men and women differently.
She said that for women, factors like hormonal fluctuations, caregiving responsibilities, and trauma could contribute to anxiety and depression, while in the case of men, traditional masculinity norms could discourage emotional expression and seeking help, leading to increased risk of substance abuse and addiction.
In Ghana, mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse were prevalent, and challenges included limited access to mental health services, inadequate infrastructure, and stigma, she said.
Madam Okine said there was a significant treatment gap in countries, including Ghana, where disorders remained untreated and highlighted the need for increased access to mental health services in the country.",,Health, 13 October 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/health/Gender-director-calls-on-individuals-to-prioritise-mental-health-2004964
