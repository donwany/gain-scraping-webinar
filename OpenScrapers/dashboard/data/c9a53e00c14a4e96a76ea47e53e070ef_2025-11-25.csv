AGI Presidential hopeful Ralph Ayitey details strategy to cut $2bn food import bill,"Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) Presidential hopeful Ralph Ayitey is proposing a significant reduction in Ghana’s over-$2 billion food import bill by through a stronger consumer preference for locally produced foods.He maintains that a strong domestic demand base can help reduce import dependence and stabilize the sector.Ghana’s annual food import bill now exceeding $2 billion continues to mount pressure on foreign exchange reserves and deepen the country’s broader economic vulnerabilities.Industry watchers warn that without a decisive shift toward local consumption, the strain on the economy will persist.AGI Presidential hopeful and Chief Executive Officer of Coconut Grove Hotels, Ralph Ayitey, in an interview with Citi Business News argued that increasing patronage of Ghana-made food products offers a viable pathway to easing the burden.“It is very important that we try as much as possible to reduce the 2-2.5 billion import bill that we have on food. Most of the foods we consume take just about 3 months. Talk of maize, rice and millet. It is important we develop the appetite and consciousness to produce and consume what we have. When we do that we reduce the burden on our cedi,” he said.Beyond food consumption, Ralph Ayitey is also advocating a revitalisation of the cotton value chain to support existing textile factories, with trial activities expected to commence in January.“We want to gauge the productivity which is the output. But the emphasis here is that we are going quite mechanized but most importantly irrigated. We want to have two cycles in a year.“We are talking about feeding GTP, Akosombo Textiles and Printex. All of them put together consumer about 50 million yards of fabric a year. It is a whole industry and a whole gold mine that is waiting to be mined,” he added.Tags: AGI ElectionsFood Import BillGhana News",Daniel Sackitey,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/agi-presidential-hopeful-ralph-ayitey-details-strategy-to-cut-2bn-food-import-bill/

"IMF: Chronic underfunding, political influence undermine Ghanas anti-corruption efforts","Ghana’s ability to fight corruption is being “severely weakened” by chronic underfunding of its key accountability institutions, according to the 2025 IMF Governance Diagnostic Report that warns the country’s anti-corruption architecture is approaching a breaking point.The report conducted in September 2023 according to the IMF reveals that major institutions, including the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), routinely receive less than half of the budget approved for them by Parliament.As a result, the agencies responsible for investigating corruption, prosecuting financial crimes, safeguarding public funds and protecting whistleblowers are operating without the basic resources needed to function.The report points out that although budgetary allocations are approved annually, actual releases from the Ministry of Finance fall far below those figures — leaving institutions unable to recruit staff, maintain critical investigations, upgrade technology or conduct specialised prosecutions.Even the OSP, established to lead high-profile corruption cases, must obtain “clearance” from the Ministry of Finance before hiring or paying its own staff, a situation the IMF describes as incompatible with operational independence.Beyond the funding crisis, the IMF warns that Ghana’s anti-corruption framework is structurally vulnerable, describing it as “fragmented, overlapping and exposed to political influence.” This deepens the systemic weaknesses caused by underfunding and further undermines the fight against corruption.The report identifies harmful overlaps among the OSP, EOCO and CHRAJ — three agencies that simultaneously investigate corruption-related offences but lack clear coordination protocols.This duplication, the IMF argues, creates confusion, delays cases and allows political actors to exploit institutional gaps.The Attorney-General’s constitutional power over all prosecutions also weakens the independence of agencies like EOCO and OSP, whose prosecutorial autonomy is more symbolic than guaranteed.The IMF cites recent examples, including the resignation of the first Special Prosecutor and the removal of the Auditor-General, as evidence of political pressure.Despite progress in digitalisation, access-to-information reforms and upgraded procurement laws, the IMF said these gains are overshadowed by deep structural weaknesses. Anti-corruption institutions lack the independence, funding and legal clarity to enforce the very laws Ghana has invested in.Without decisive reforms — including guaranteed financing, mandate clarification, and insulation from political interference — the IMF warns that corruption will continue to drain public revenue, weaken investor confidence and undermine Ghana’s economic recovery.Diversified growth pushes Ghana’s economy into expansion mode — BoGTags: Anti-corruptionCHRAJCorruptionEOCOGhana NewsIMFOSP",William Narh,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/imf-chronic-underfunding-political-influence-undermine-ghanas-anti-corruption-efforts/
Group to march to Jubilee House to demand Kissi Agyebengs removal,"A group of Ghanaians is expected to stage a protest on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, calling for the removal of Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng over what the group describes as his failure to fulfil his mandate.On Monday, November 24, Apostle Abraham Larbi Lincoln, the Lead Convener of the demonstration, said the group believes President John Dramani Mahama should terminate the Special Prosecutor’s appointment.He noted that the protest, themed “Agro Ne Fom,” aims to highlight what the group sees as inefficiency at the Office of the Special Prosecutor.“We will be in our reds, and we will be there to present our case. If he doesn’t listen, then we know the kind of person he is. We are marching straight to the Jubilee House, and we will petition the President,” he said.Apostle Lincoln added that the group does not hate Mr. Agyebeng but wants the office either reformed or dissolved entirely, with all staff removed.Meanwhile, private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu has disclosed that 15 separate petitions have been submitted seeking the Special Prosecutor’s removal, suggesting deepening public dissatisfaction.“As we speak now, there are 15 petitions to remove Kissi Agyebeng. When was the last time you heard of other persons subject to Article 146 proceedings ever having 15 petitions filed against them? That tells you that there is something wrong,” Mr. Kpebu stated.The protest will end with the submission of a formal petition to President Mahama at the Jubilee House.OSP and AG must cooperate, avoid tension – Inusah FuseiniTags: Apostle Abraham Larbi LincolnKissi AgyebengOffice of the special prosecutor",Sammi Wiafe,,"November 25, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/group-to-march-to-jubilee-house-to-demand-kissi-agyebengs-removal/
Agbodza: Citi FM/Channel One TVs advocacy spurred action on PokuaseNsawam road,"The Minister of Roads and Highways, Kwame Governs Agbodza, has acknowledged the significant role played by Citi FM and Channel One TV in prompting renewed government attention to the Pokuase–Nsawam road project.His remarks follow months of media advocacy on the Citi Breakfast Show and extensive reports by Citi FM and Channel One TV, which spotlighted the daily struggles of residents and commuters who rely on the deteriorating stretch.The platforms amplified the voices of affected community members, bringing national attention to the long-standing challenges and delays surrounding the project.Speaking on Channel One TV’s The Point of View with Bernard Avle on Monday, November 24, Mr. Agbodza commended the two stations for their consistency and public-interest journalism, noting that their advocacy contributed to the government’s response.He also confirmed that contractors have returned to the site and that work is progressing as expected.“I want to take the opportunity to thank you and your network [Channel One TV/Citi FM] for your consistent way in which you were the voice of the people. In the specific case of Pokuase-Nsawam, you gave a voice to people to speak.“I keep telling people that was feedback for me that needed to be done.

Kasoa-Winneba road to be completed June 2026  Agbodza,"The Kasoa-Winneba stretch of the coastal highway is expected to be completed by June 2026, the Roads and Highways Minister, Kwame Governs Agbodza, has confirmed.Speaking on the progress of ongoing road projects on Channel One TV‘s The Point of View on Monday November 24, Agbodza said, “The contractor says that by June next year it will all be done.”He added “For the Winneba to Mankessim section, the contract allows for two years, but I am confident it will be completed before 2027.”He noted that once these projects are finished, the route from Kasoa to Takoradi will be fully dualised, enhancing connectivity between the Greater Accra and Central Regions.The Kasoa-Winneba-Mankessim project involves three separate contractors, while the Cape Coast to Takoradi section is handled by another.Mr Agbodza who is also the Member of Parliament for Adaklu explained that the Cape Coast to Takoradi road is a larger project that links the two regions. Within the Central Region, the Kasoa-Winneba and Winneba-Mankessim sections are progressing steadily.“When you travel from Winneba to Mankessim, we are building a brand new road alongside the existing one to dualise it. The Winneba interchange was not initially part of the project, but it has now been included,” he added.Addressing the traffic bottlenecks experienced this year on the Kasoa-Winneba section, the Minister acknowledged that construction planning had contributed to delays.“We made a mistake when we started working on the main carriageway and the expansion at the same time. This led to many of the bottlenecks we saw,” he said.Once completed, the dual carriageway will significantly improve travel along the coastal corridor, supporting trade and easing congestion for motorists.Read also…2026 budget stable but not transformative – CERPATags: Cape Coast to TakoradiChannel One TVGhanaGhana NewsheadlineKasoa-WinnebaKasoa-Winneba-MankessimKwame AgbodzaRoads and Highways Minister",Abigail Arthur,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/kasoa-winneba-road-to-be-completed-june-2026-agbodza/
EC Staffer behind petition for Jean Mensas removal interdicted,"Joseph Blankson Adumadzie, a staff member of the Electoral Commission (EC) who petitioned President John Dramani Mahama to remove Chairperson Jean Mensa and her two deputies, has revealed that he is currently on interdiction.Mr Adumadzie, who filed the petition under Article 146 of the Constitution over alleged misconduct by the three top EC officials, explained that his current situation at the Commission was not the reason he decided to speak out. He said his decision was prompted by broader concerns over how the Commission was being run.According to him, he has been on interdiction for sometime now over issues related to Biometric Verification Devices (BVDs).“For a while now I don’t go to work. I have not resigned, I have not been sacked. I am on an interdiction. It’s a whole lot,” he said on Citi Eyewitness News on Monday November 24. He explained that the interdiction stemmed from allegations linking him to old BVDs that were reportedly found in a refuse dump.He insisted that the claims against him were false. “It was about these BVDs. They were saying things that were not true about me but I don’t want to go there. Yes, the old machines, but they are not with me and it is not even true. That is the whole thing,” he said.Mr Adumadzie further disclosed that the Commission took legal action against him but failed to prove the allegations in court.“They sued me and couldn’t prove anything. And for one year I won the case, and I have sued them,” he added.He clarified that his decision to petition President Mahama was not driven by personal anger or his interdiction. Instead, he said it was motivated by concerns about the Commission’s integrity and the need for accountability at the highest levels.In the petition he submitted to the President, Mr Adumadzie cites 12 grounds of alleged misconduct against the Chairperson and her deputies, including cronyism, abuse of office and gross incompetence. He argues that their actions have weakened public confidence in the EC and pose a threat to Ghana’s electoral credibility.He has since called on President Mahama to refer the petition to the Chief Justice to determine whether a prima facie case exists, in line with constitutional procedures.Read alsoEC staff petitions Mahama to remove Chairperson Jean Mensa, deputiesTags: Biometric Verification Devices (BVDs)Bossman AsareGhanaGhana NewsheadlineJean MensaJoseph Blankson Adumadzie",Abigail Arthur,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/ive-been-interdicted-ec-staff-who-petitioned-mahama/
Matthew Nyindam: Im not afraid of Kpandai rerun,"The Member of Parliament for Kpandai, Mathew Nyindam, says he is unfazed by the prospect of a rerun of the constituency’s parliamentary election if the legal process ultimately requires it.His comments come after the Tamale High Court on Monday ordered the Electoral Commission to conduct a fresh poll within 30 days, following a petition challenging the outcome of the December 7, 2024, election.Nyindam has since filed notices of appeal and a stay of execution to halt the implementation of the High Court’s directive.Speaking to Citi News, the Kpandai MP insisted that the certified results clearly affirm his victory and that he continues to hold the mandate of his constituents.“If you look at the pink sheets, it is on record that they have admitted that every single pink sheet was given to all the political parties. I have my 152, they have theirs. If you put the results together, we have won the elections. Let me put it on record that I am still their MP,” Nyindam said.He added that while he has confidence in his legal challenge, he will fully comply with a rerun if the courts ultimately order one.Nyindam further alleged that the governing NDC is attempting to use state institutions to unseat him but stressed he was not intimidated.“I am not afraid of a rerun. If genuinely we have to run, we won’t have a problem. But if you decide to pave your way through because you think you are in government and you can use state powers to coerce the people to vote for you that is where we have a difficulty,” he stated.The High Court ruling followed a petition filed by former MP and NDC parliamentary candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal, who alleged irregularities and inconsistencies in FORM 8A—the Statement of Polls and Declaration of Results for MPs—across 41 of the 152 polling stations in Kpandai. Wakpal argued that these issues compromised the integrity of the election that declared Nyindam the winner.Kpandai MP Matthew Nyindam files appeal, seeks stay of rerun orderTags: Daniel Nsala WakpalGhanaGhana NewsKpandaiMathew Nyindam",Juliana Odame Asare,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/matthew-nyindam-im-not-afraid-of-kpandai-rerun/
You are the Leaders of today: Comfort Ocran rallies youth as Springboard marks 18 Years,"The Executive Director of the Springboard Road Show Foundation, Comfort Ocran, has reaffirmed the organisation’s commitment to empowering young people as Springboard celebrated 18 years of nationwide impact at its 2025 Grand Finale held at the University of Professional Studies, Accra on Saturday 22nd November.Addressing thousands of participants, Comfort Ocran said the Ghana Grows programme “is not ending today; it is only beginning,” adding that hope must be treated as a practical skill young people can apply. She noted that since 2007, Springboard’s nationwide interventions have reached more than one million young people across Ghana and West Africa.Under the Ghana Grows programme, delivered in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, Springboard has engaged more than 500,000 participants.In 2025 alone, 145,605 young people took part, with young women making up 93.3 percent of the total. Another 3,469 persons with disabilities participated across all sixteen regions.Comfort Ocran said many participants have moved into agriculture, agribusiness, and TVET pathways, contributing to better livelihoods in their communities.Technical Director of the Foundation, Rev. Albert Ocran, urged the youth to prioritise excellence, collaboration, and value creation as anchors for national progress. He reminded them that progress is a collective effort, saying, “You cannot build something significant working alone, if you want to go farther and faster, go together.” He encouraged young people to build networks, share what works, and support one another as they rise.The Grand Finale drew an audience of more than 6,000, including young women, young men, persons with disabilities, traditional leaders, institutional heads, and associations.As part of the celebration, five rising changemakers were honoured under the Young Innovators Awards. The awardees, three young women and two persons with disabilities, included Kow Aboagye Ghunney (Agriculture), Clara Messe (Akorfa) (Agribusiness), David Wakpal (ATVET), Mary Tetteh (Most Promising Agripreneur and YLO Model Ambassador), and Justine Mauda A. Aniaku (Best YLO Facilitator).Emelia Asamoah, Head of Workforce Development at the Mastercard Foundation, commended Springboard for helping reshape perceptions about agriculture and vocational careers. She noted that TVET enrolment has risen by 193 percent since 2020 and praised the progress of young farmers under the Ghana Grows programme, saying, “These sectors were once seen as fallback options, but Ghana Grows is proving they are innovative and future focused.”Building on these achievements, Dr. Kafui Mills-Odoi, Head of Inclusion for Nigeria at the Mastercard Foundation, encouraged the young innovators and wider youth audience to pursue growth with confidence and preparation. “You must have confidence and believe, not only to secure a job, but to maintain it and grow in it,” she said.“Your voice is not just the sound you make; it is the influence you carry. Take time to prepare, to build competence, and to understand the challenges around you so you can create real solutions.”Tags: Comfort OcranGhana NewsSpringboard",Juliana Odame Asare,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/you-are-the-leaders-of-today-comfort-ocran-rallies-youth-as-springboard-marks-18-years/
Ghana calls for global gold certification regime to combat smuggling,"Ghana is urging the international community to establish a multilateral certification scheme for gold, similar to the United Nations–backed Kimberley Process for diamonds, to prevent smuggled gold from entering the global supply chain.The proposal was announced by the Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod), Sammy Gyamfi, during the 2025 Dubai Precious Metals Conference in Dubai.Mr. Gyamfi said the absence of a unified international certification framework has enabled illicit gold to flow freely across borders, fuelling money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities.He stressed that a global mechanism is urgently needed to protect both producing and importing countries from the growing risks associated with illegal gold trading.According to him, a certification regime would enhance transparency, improve accountability and restore integrity to the global gold industry.“Just as the Kimberley Process helped curb conflict diamonds, a similar scheme for gold will prevent smuggled metal from entering legitimate supply chains,” he said.He added that Ghana stands ready to work with the United Arab Emirates, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), the World Gold Council, the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), and governments worldwide to advance the initiative.“We are confident that these steps will bolster global Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing efforts,” he noted.The call comes amid concerns that discrepancies between gold export records in Ghana and import records in other countries reflect large-scale smuggling. Mr. Gyamfi warned that the phenomenon has strengthened criminal networks and undermined good governance across several gold-producing nations.In his speech, he also highlighted Ghana’s recent reforms to tighten control over its artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector, including stricter licensing, increased enforcement, and the impending rollout of a blockchain-based Track and Trace system by 2026 to verify the origin of all ASM gold.Mr. Gyamfi emphasised that global cooperation is essential to closing the loopholes exploited by smugglers. He called on industry leaders and international organisations to support developing countries that are working to transform their ASM sectors and safeguard the integrity of the global gold supply chain. Tags: Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod)GhanaGhana NewsinternationalKimberley ProcessSammy Gyamfi",Abigail Arthur,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/ghana-calls-for-global-gold-certification-regime-to-combat-smuggling/

Govt failed to prioritise health sector in 2026 budget  Kingsley Agyemang,"The Minority on the Health Committee has slammed the government for failing to prioritise healthcare in the country, following the allocation made for the health sector in the 2026 budget.According to a member of Parliament’s Health Committee and MP for Abuakwa South, Dr. Kingsley Agyemang, the government appears more interested in purchasing aircraft, while key campaign promises made by the NDC government ahead of the 2024 elections have not been reflected in the 2025 and 2026 budgets.In a media interview, Dr. Agyemang noted that the 2026 budget offers little to support the health sector.He argues that government’s funding choices point to “misplaced priorities,” particularly the sharp reduction in the nursing training allowance from GH₵770 million in 2025 to GH₵474 million in the 2026 projections.He said the budget ignores several NDC manifesto promises, including market clinics, mobile medical vans for rural communities, and the upgrading of senior high school sickbays into satellite clinics.“You’re in your second year of government, yet none of these has seen any expression in the budget,” he stated.
The MP further criticised the absence of occupational health and safety reforms, tax waivers for health professionals, and risk insurance for frontline workers – initiatives he said were boldly promised by the NDC.Calling the cuts to nursing training funds “dangerous” for the health workforce pipeline, he also questioned why government has failed to show progress on its pledge to construct two new nursing training institutions.Dr. Agyemang contrasted the declining health allocation with what he described as a massive GH₵12 billion plan to procure presidential and military jets, arguing that a country grappling with galamsey-induced health crises should be funnelling more investment into health infrastructure and services.“With the health sector receiving less than 8 percent of total allocation – far below the 15 percent Abuja target—this budget is unhealthy and a clear sign of misplaced priorities,” he stressed.Dr. Agyemang further stressed that the heightened illegal mining activities demand that the government prioritize the country’s health sector.“The key issue confronting this country now is galamsey. If there is any sector that bears the consequences of galamsey, it is the health sector. Regarding this budget and its provisions for health, there is nothing good to say about it. The government has clearly lost its way when it comes to health prioritization.”Tags: 2026 BudgetAbuakwa South MPGhana NewsHealthMinority",Philip Nii Lartey,,"November 21, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/govt-failed-to-prioritise-health-sector-in-2026-budget-kingsley-agyemang/

GMA condemns violence at Northern Regional Hospital,"The Ghana Medical Association (GMA) has condemned violent incidents at the Northern Regional Hospital, formerly Tamale Central Hospital, following a viral video circulating on social media.The footage reportedly shows some youth besieging the hospital, locking up the office of the Medical Director and other administrative offices, and barricading the Outpatients Department.In a statement, the GMA described the acts as lawless and dangerous, warning that such behaviour endangers the lives of patients and staff, as well as hospital property. The Association expressed concern over a growing trend of youth groups storming health facilities to threaten managers instead of following proper procedures to resolve grievances.The GMA is urging the police to take swift action against those responsible. It also called on traditional leaders to intervene, urging the youth to follow appropriate channels to address their concerns. Additionally, the Association appealed to the leadership of the Ghana Health Service to ensure adequate protection for the Medical Director and all hospital staff while resolving any issues.Dr. (Dent) Richard Selormey, GMA General Secretary, said the Association is closely monitoring the situation and will take further action if threats to health workers persist.  …..Explore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!Click on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:

"Rotation Nurses, Midwives threaten nationwide demonstration over delayed allowances","The 2024/2025 cohort of Rotation Nurses and Midwives has threatened to stage a nationwide demonstration if the Ministry of Health fails to pay their long-delayed rotation allowances by the end of November.In a press statement dated Tuesday, November 18, the group warned that they will peacefully picket at the Ministry of Health and take to the streets to demand payment of allowances owed to them.They emphasised that, despite fulfilling their service and clinical duties for months, the Ministry has yet to complete necessary clearance processes or release payments, leaving them financially strained and frustrated.The group has set clear demands: full payment of outstanding allowances for the 2024/2025 cohort, expedited clearance for junior colleagues, and an end to the practice of health personnel working without pay.“Should the Ministry fail to honour this commitment by the stated deadline, we will have no option but to peacefully hit the streets and stage a nationwide demonstration to demand what is rightfully ours,” the statement said.The group said that despite a statement by the Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, on October 13, 2025, promising clearance for more than 17,000 rotational health professionals and the commencement of allowance payments in November, no progress has been made.“With only 12 days left in the month, the necessary clearance processes have reportedly not been completed, leaving nurses and midwives frustrated and financially strained,” the statement said.The nurses and midwives also called on the media, stakeholders, parents, and the general public to support their cause, urging transparency, fairness, and respect for the welfare of service personnel.SML scandal: OSP slaps 78 charges on Ofori-Atta, former GRA Bosses Tags: Ghana NewsProtestRotation Nurses and Midwives 2024/2025 service year group",Leticia Osei,,"November 18, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/rotation-nurses-midwives-threaten-nationwide-demonstration-over-delayed-allowances/
Ghanaian Researcher Revolutionizes Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Globally,"Antimicrobial resistance surveillance has never been done this way before. Abena Ntim Asamoah has made two discoveries that should terrify and inspire the global health establishment in equal measure. First, she proved that a simple text message reminder can reduce maternal deaths by 45 percent in places where women die in childbirth at rates 100 times higher than in wealthy nations. Then she demonstrated that antimicrobial resistance surveillance through sewage systems can detect deadly superbugs weeks before they kill hospital patients.
The connection between these breakthroughs is what makes her work revolutionary. Both reveal the same uncomfortable truth: the world’s most lethal health crises could be stopped if we simply looked at data we’re already collecting but systematically ignoring.“I kept seeing the same pattern,” says Asamoah, a pharmaceutical analytics researcher at Harrisburg University in Pennsylvania. “Whether it’s mothers dying or superbugs spreading, by the time our health systems notice the problem, people are already dead. But the warning signs were there all along.”Her journey began at The Trust Hospital in Ghana, where she watched pregnant women arrive too late for interventions that could have saved them. At the same time, patients were dying from infections that antibiotics could no longer cure. Two separate crises, or so it seemed.Then Asamoah, trained in both pharmaceutical science and data analytics, recognized something others missed. Both problems stemmed from the same flaw: health systems designed to respond to crises rather than predict them.The numbers tell a staggering story. Globally, 295,000 women die each year from preventable pregnancy and childbirth complications, with 94 percent of these deaths in poor countries. Meanwhile, antimicrobial resistance kills 1.27 million people annually, more than HIV and malaria combined. By 2050, resistant infections could claim 10 million lives per year.Yet Asamoah’s research, published in two separate groundbreaking studies, shows these deaths are largely preventable with tools that already exist.Her systematic review on digital health, analyzing over 40 studies covering thousands of pregnancies across developing countries, revealed that mobile health interventions increased antenatal care attendance by 45 percent. Telehealth services improved skilled birth attendance by 38 percent.“A text message costs almost nothing to send,” she notes. “But in rural Ghana, Bangladesh, or Kenya, that message reminding a woman about her clinic appointment can literally be the difference between life and death.”But here’s where Asamoah’s insight becomes powerful. The same data driven approach that saves mothers can track the invisible spread of killer bacteria.Her second major research project proposes a global surveillance network that integrates clinical records, genomic sequences, environmental monitoring, social media reports, and human movement patterns. Machine learning algorithms analyze these diverse data streams to spot resistance patterns emerging in real time.The results from pilot programs worldwide are startling. Urban metagenomic surveillance detected unknown antimicrobial resistance genes in 60 cities across six continents. Veterinary systems in Australia identified emerging resistance in animals six months before similar patterns appeared in humans. Real time clinical platforms cut detection time for unusual infection patterns from weeks to under 48 hours.Machine learning models can now process this information simultaneously and identify resistance hotspots with 85 to 92 percent accuracy. Environmental reservoirs in urban transit systems showed resistance gene prevalence rates up to 300 percent higher than in nearby hospitals. Wastewater monitoring detected resistant bacteria weeks before they appeared in clinical infections.What connects her two research projects is the recognition that prevention beats treatment, but only if you’re looking in the right places.“Traditional health systems wait for problems to arrive at the hospital door,” Asamoah says. “But hospitals are where people go when prevention has already failed. If we want to stop deaths, we need to intervene earlier, and data shows us exactly when and where to act.”Yet her research exposes a troubling reality. The same technologies that could save millions of lives are being deployed unevenly. Sub Saharan Africa, where maternal mortality rates are highest and antibiotic resistance is growing fastest, has less than five percent of global genomic sequencing capacity.Mobile health programs that work brilliantly in connected cities fail in rural areas with unreliable electricity and internet. Sophisticated algorithms trained on data from rich countries miss patterns in poor ones.“We have the technology. We have the data,” Asamoah says. “But we’re not deploying it where it’s needed most, which happens to be where these problems are killing the most people.”Her background gives her a unique perspective. Growing up in Ghana, she witnessed firsthand the healthcare gaps that claim lives. Now, through her pharmaceutical analytics training, she’s demonstrating how data science could close those gaps.But she’s equally clear about limitations. For maternal health, power cuts, poor connectivity, low literacy, and cultural barriers remain massive obstacles. For antimicrobial surveillance, data quality varies wildly, with missing entries in clinical databases ranging from 15 to 40 percent.“Technology isn’t a magic solution,” she cautions. “Without proper implementation, we risk creating new inequities where only urban populations benefit while rural communities fall further behind.”Her research identifies what actually works. For maternal health: involving communities in design, training local workers, ensuring systems function offline, and adapting to local languages. For superbug surveillance: integrating diverse data sources, using algorithms that account for incomplete data, and establishing clear privacy frameworks.The political obstacles are immense. Who pays for global surveillance when benefits are shared but costs are local? Who controls data when a resistant strain detected in one country threatens another?Asamoah argues these questions cannot excuse inaction. “Every day we delay, mothers die who could have been saved by a text message. Patients die from infections we could have seen coming if we’d been monitoring wastewater. These aren’t hypothetical future deaths. They’re happening right now.”Her approach to antimicrobial resistance surveillance represents a paradigm shift. Traditional antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems wait for pathogens to appear in hospitals, but Asamoah’s framework tracks resistance genes in the environment, creating a true early warning system. This multi-source antimicrobial resistance surveillance integrates data that conventional systems ignore.Her work demonstrates that preventing health crises requires treating surveillance as a global commons, like climate monitoring, rather than a patchwork of national systems with blind spots at every border.“A superbug emerging in a Ghanaian farm can kill someone in a London hospital within months. A mother dying in rural India represents a failure of the same systems that should protect pregnant women in New York,” she explains. “We’re all connected, whether we acknowledge it or not.”What makes her perspective valuable is her refusal to separate technical solutions from questions of equity. She understands that the most sophisticated algorithm is useless if it doesn’t reach the people who need it most.Her vision is ambitious but grounded in evidence. A world where every pregnant woman receives personalized digital support. Where resistant bacteria are detected and contained before they reach hospitals. Where doctors make decisions guided by real time global data.The infrastructure exists. Mobile penetration in developing countries has created an enabling environment. Cloud computing makes global integration feasible. Genomic sequencing costs have dropped 99 percent in a decade.What remains missing is political will.“We can see all of these threats coming if we choose to look,” she says. “The data is screaming warnings at us. Text messages can save mothers. Toilet water can predict pandemics. The question is whether we’re willing to act on what we already know.”The uncomfortable genius of her work is showing that we’ve had the tools to solve these crises all along. We’ve just been too blind, too siloed, or too unwilling to invest in solutions that would primarily benefit the world’s poorest populations.Now the data is undeniable. The mothers are still dying, the superbugs are still spreading, and the warnings Asamoah has uncovered are getting louder every day.Tags: Abena Ntim AsamoahAbena Ntim Asamoah antimicrobial resistance maternal mortality digital health global health surveillance superbug detection mHealth interventionsantimicrobial resistanceDigital healthglobal healthhealth interventionsMaternal mortalitysuperbug detectionsurveillance",Emmanuel Owusu,,"November 18, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/ghanaian-researcher-revolutionizes-antimicrobial-resistance-surveillance-globally/
Frankel foundation urges govt support diabetes fight,"The founder of the Frankel Foundation for Diabetics, Lydia Agyin‑Frimpong, has urged the government to provide stronger support to tackle the rising incidence of diabetes in Ghana, particularly as the MahamaCares initiative is rolled out.Ghana records an estimated 200,000 new diabetes cases annually, with health experts warning of a growing number of type 2 diabetes cases among children.Speaking to Citi News on Friday, November 14, during World Diabetes Day activities held in collaboration with the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, Lydia Agyin‑Frimpong highlighted the serious complications associated with the disease, including stroke and blindness.“Between 2021 and 2025, alongside other diseases such as cancer, HIV, kidney diseases, strokes, and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes has been among the most recorded cases.

"Radiographers push for six-year training to boost imaging quality, specialist skills","The Ghana Society of Radiographers is calling on the Allied Health Professions Council and the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission GTEC to extend the 4-year training of Radiographers in Ghana to six years as recommended by the West African Health Organisation to meet the desired imaging excellence in the country.The association says the move will afford Higher Level Radiographers the opportunity to advance their roles in specialising into Modality-specific imaging, Image interpretation, Research, Teaching, Administration and other Radiological sub-specializations.Products from the six-year training according to the Ghana Society of Radiographers will be the bedrock in moving from Generalist to Specialist at a postgraduate level.In his welcome address at the HARRIET DUAH QUIZ COMPETITION as part of the celebration of the 130th World Radiography Day of the Ghana Society of Radiographers (GSR), the President of the GSR, Dr. Prince Rockson ( Togbe Kpegba Agbakpe I) noted that:“If we are looking at imaging excellence then we need to look at people who are so abreast with almost all the things. I am saying that the four-year training programme is inadequate for this whole modality. Some schools are training imaging specific modality, somebody is doing ultrasound for four years and somebody is looking at all these modalities for four years. So, I am calling on the various institutions with the Allied Health Professional Council and the GTEC to harmonize the curriculum at the first-degree level so that we can stop those pseudo specialisations at the first-degree level. We don’t specialize at first degree”.He added “We need appropriately trained professionals at the various specialized levels to handle patients in embracing the global technological advancement’’.The 8th of November marks the day set aside by the world to commemorate the discovery of X-Rays by Prof. Conrad Roentgen in 1895; and how this discovery revolutionized medical practice as we know it today.It is a day which, internationally, is referred to as World Radiography Day, and is celebrated around the globe annually.It is a commemorative day marked by events that underscore the role played by the discovery, and to reassess the Quality of services derived from the use of X-rays, and the Technological advancements made to enhance safe and effective use of the discovery.The Day brings together, and strengthens the unity of purpose and interdependence of the various professions that deal with the clinical use of X-rays and other energies in visualizing the internal structures of the body.‎Further, the purpose of this commemoration is to promote Radiographers are the interface between imaging technology and patients and are professionally accountable for patients’ physical and psychological wellbeing, immediately prior to, during and following imaging investigations or therapy procedures.Radiographers take an active role in the justification and optimisation of medical imaging and radio therapeutic procedures, and have a critical position and vital role in the radiation safety of patients, carers and relatives in accordance with the “As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP)” principle and relevant legislation.Globally, recent developments have seen an increase integration of complex machine learning algorithms and artificially intelligent systems (AI) within medical safety, equipment operation, image review and treatment planning processes.Adoption of AI in medical imaging and radiation therapy requires radiographers to adapt their imaging and treatment practices to ensure new technology is being implemented, used and regulated appropriately, based on high quality research evidence, maximising benefits to their patients.Changes in practice must be underpinned by appropriate education and training for these professions and to attract the youth, sustain and perpetuate the profession for the benefit of the society.Tags: Ghana NewsImaging QualityRadiographersSpecialist skillsTraining",Citi Newsroom,,"November 8, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/radiographers-push-for-six-year-training-to-boost-imaging-quality-specialist-skills/
Dr. James Asare-Adjei outlines bold vision as new Chancellor of Heritage Christian University,"Dr. James Asare-Adjei has been invested as the Chancellor of Heritage Christian University (HCU), marking a historic milestone for the decade-old faith-based institution.During a solemn and celebratory investiture ceremony held on campus, Dr. Asare-Adjei pledged to move beyond ceremonial duties and instead serve as a strategic advocate and catalyst for transformation, unveiling an ambitious four-point agenda to secure HCU’s sustainability, academic excellence, and national relevance.A Chancellor with a MissionIn his acceptance speech, Dr. Asare-Adjei emphasized that his role would be defined not by titles, but by tangible impact. “I should not be just a ceremonial face of the university,” he declared, acknowledging the unique challenges facing young, private, faith-based universities in Ghana.Instead, he vowed to leverage his three decades of experience in business, industry leadership, and academia to advance HCU’s mission: “to provide education that cultivates conviction, character, creativity, compassion, and community to serve God and neighbour.”Dr. Asare-Adjei, an industrialist, academic, and former President of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), brings a rare blend of private-sector pragmatism and scholarly insight to the chancellorship.His professional portfolio includes founding and leading the Asadtek Group; a conglomerate with interests in manufacturing, real estate, and construction, and serving on high-level national boards including the Commission forTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (C-TVET) and the Ghana Skills Development Fund.L-R: Council Chairperson, Chancellor, PresidentFour Strategic Pillars for GrowthCentral to Dr. Asare-Adjei’s vision are four strategic initiatives aimed at positioning HCU as a model of innovation, self-reliance, and service:US$5 Million Endowment FundThe Chancellor announced plans to establish a US$5 million endowment fund to ensure long-term financial stability. The fund will support scholarships for underprivileged but high-performing students, boost research and innovation, and reduce overreliance on tuition revenue. Dr. Asare-Adjei pledged to mobilize support from alumni, churches, international partners, and philanthropists to realize this goal.1,000-Bed Student HostelRecognizing that student well-being is integral to academic success, the Chancellor committed to constructing a modern, 1,000-bed hostel. The facility will address growing housing demand and foster a vibrant residential campus where spiritual formation, mentorship, and community life can flourish.Dedicated Fleet for Clinical TrainingTo strengthen its health sciences programmes, HCU will acquire a fleet of buses exclusively for nursing and allied health students’ clinical rotations. This move respondsdirectly to industry feedback about logistical barriers in practical training and ensures the university’s commitment to producing job-ready, compassionate healthcare professionals.1,000-Acre Agribusiness EnterprisePerhaps the most transformative initiative is the planned development of a 1,000-acre university farm and agro-processing enterprise. The project will serve as a living laboratory for experiential learning, generate income for the institution, create local jobs, enhance food security, and exemplify Christian stewardship of natural resources, aligning with HCU’s emphasis on science, technology, entrepreneurship, and faith.Addressing the Crisis in Graduate EmployabilityDr. Asare-Adjei did not shy away from hard truths. He acknowledged the growing disconnect between university curricula and labor market needs, citing the emergence of an “Association of Unemployed Graduates” as a stark warning.“The future of higher education is increasingly stressing the importance of STEMI-Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Innovation,” he said, while affirming that the humanities and social sciences remain vital to holistic formation.He called on HCU to lead a renaissance in Christian higher education. One that is “rooted in truth, driven by innovation, and anchored in service.” In an era where information is abundant but wisdom is scarce, he stressed that the university must form not just knowledgeable graduates, but leaders of character and conviction.Message to Students: “You Are the Heart of This University”Turning directly to students, the “heart of the university”; Dr. Asare-Adjei urged them to embody the five Cs: conviction, character, creativity, compassion, and community. “You are the leaders Ghana and the world are waiting for,” he affirmed, challenging them to see their education not as a personal credential, but as a sacred trust for national transformation.A Legacy in the MakingDr. James Asare-Adjei’s investiture comes at a pivotal moment for Heritage Christian University. Founded with a vision to be a leading Christian institution promoting excellence in science, technology, and entrepreneurship, HCU is now poised to transition from survival to strategic leadership under his chancellorship.With earned doctorates in Business Administration and Applied Business Research from SBS Swiss Business School, an MBA from Birmingham City University, and a BSc in Engineering from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Dr. Asare-Adjei bridges the worlds of faith, business, and academia like few others in Ghana’s higher education landscape.His track record includes representing Ghanaian industry at global forums such as the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council (UK), the Confederation of German Industries (BDI), and the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII).He has also served on advisory boards for the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Energy, and theUniversity of Ghana’s ISSER, and chaired Hope Children’s Village, demonstrating a lifelong commitment to service.A New Chapter BeginsAs Heritage Christian University enters its second decade, Dr. Asare-Adjei’s investiture signals more than a change in leadership, it heralds a new chapter of purpose-driven growth.His blend of spiritual grounding, entrepreneurial acumen, and unwavering belief in education as a force for national renewal offers a compelling blueprint for faith-based universities across Africa.Tags: ChancellorDr. James Asare-AdjeiGhana NewsHeritage Christian University",Citi Newsroom,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/dr-james-asare-adjei-outlines-bold-vision-as-new-chancellor-of-heritage-christian-university/

Yango Ride introduces new safety flow within its app in Ghana,"Yango Ride, part of the global tech company Yango Group, has introduced an updated safety flow in its application in Ghana.The update integrates personalised safety checklists, enabling passengers to view the current status of implemented security measures during their rides, and a brand new safety center with security tips before and during the journey.The update will gradually become available for all users in the near future.Yango Ride integrates personalized safety checklists designed for passengers to see the status of implemented security measures during their rides. The interface automatically reminds users to turn on special features like sharing the route with trusted contact or updating profile information, and demonstrates the current status of the ride and its safety level. Pre-trip checklist and PIN-code: steps to make trips more convenient and saferThe new safety center displays a list of essential measures for passengers, which includes reading onboarding materials, filling in users information, adding trusted contacts, taking a selfie, or updating their email.If anything from the list is missing, the application will mark this item and prompt the user to take the necessary action and fill the gap.Passengers can learn more about standards for partner drivers, how to get help in case of a conflict or an accident and learn more about each security feature in one click.The main screen always contains quick access buttons for SOS-signal and support in case of any emergency.“Safety remains our top priority at Yango, and we know it’s important not just to put strong safety measures and security technology in place, but to make sure every user can clearly see them. With our new personalised safety checklists and updates, our platform users in Ghana can now follow exactly how we’re keeping them protected at every stage of their journey — from the moment they request a ride to when they reach their destination.” says Tom Ofonime, Country Manager for Yango Ride in Ghana. Yango Ride also gradually implements a new feature with matching PIN-codes for passengers and partner drivers. Before the ride begins, a unique four-digit code is generated and displayed to both the passenger and the driver in their apps.To start the trip, the passenger needs to name this PIN code to the driver — this process aims to help confirm that users are entering the correct vehicle.Safety status became more visible during the ridesThe new safety center shows the current status of the journey and indicates which safety check-ups and features are implemented. The factors that are considered while calculating the security level include:Latest driver identification check:  Partner drivers are required to upload photographs of the front and back of their driver’s license, along with a selfie holding the license. The system compares these details with the information in the driver’s profile. Drivers cannot take orders unless this process is completed.Speeding control: Yango Ride app uses GPS to track a driver’s route and determine the speed. This speed is then compared to the maximum speed allowed on that section, according to data from the navigator used to build the route.Driving style control: The driving behavior monitoring system helps drivers to drive safely. It processes data from accelerometers and gyroscopes in the partner driver’s smartphones and detects sudden changes in acceleration, deceleration, and maneuvering.After each episode of unsafe driving, a warning is sent to the partner driver asking them to drive more carefully. If the partner driver ignores the warnings, access to the service may be restricted.Safety is one of the main areas of focus for the Yango Ride service. Over 25 special features are available for both passengers and partner drivers before, during, and after the ride.These features include speed and driving style monitoring, the ability to share routes and trip details with trusted contacts, a quick access to SOS numbers in case of an emergency, and others.About Yango Group Yango Group is an international tech company, transforming globally sourced technologies into everyday services that are tailored to local communities.

Ghanaian Researcher Revolutionizes Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Globally,"Antimicrobial resistance surveillance has never been done this way before. Abena Ntim Asamoah has made two discoveries that should terrify and inspire the global health establishment in equal measure. First, she proved that a simple text message reminder can reduce maternal deaths by 45 percent in places where women die in childbirth at rates 100 times higher than in wealthy nations. Then she demonstrated that antimicrobial resistance surveillance through sewage systems can detect deadly superbugs weeks before they kill hospital patients.
The connection between these breakthroughs is what makes her work revolutionary. Both reveal the same uncomfortable truth: the world’s most lethal health crises could be stopped if we simply looked at data we’re already collecting but systematically ignoring.“I kept seeing the same pattern,” says Asamoah, a pharmaceutical analytics researcher at Harrisburg University in Pennsylvania. “Whether it’s mothers dying or superbugs spreading, by the time our health systems notice the problem, people are already dead. But the warning signs were there all along.”Her journey began at The Trust Hospital in Ghana, where she watched pregnant women arrive too late for interventions that could have saved them. At the same time, patients were dying from infections that antibiotics could no longer cure. Two separate crises, or so it seemed.Then Asamoah, trained in both pharmaceutical science and data analytics, recognized something others missed. Both problems stemmed from the same flaw: health systems designed to respond to crises rather than predict them.The numbers tell a staggering story. Globally, 295,000 women die each year from preventable pregnancy and childbirth complications, with 94 percent of these deaths in poor countries. Meanwhile, antimicrobial resistance kills 1.27 million people annually, more than HIV and malaria combined. By 2050, resistant infections could claim 10 million lives per year.Yet Asamoah’s research, published in two separate groundbreaking studies, shows these deaths are largely preventable with tools that already exist.Her systematic review on digital health, analyzing over 40 studies covering thousands of pregnancies across developing countries, revealed that mobile health interventions increased antenatal care attendance by 45 percent. Telehealth services improved skilled birth attendance by 38 percent.“A text message costs almost nothing to send,” she notes. “But in rural Ghana, Bangladesh, or Kenya, that message reminding a woman about her clinic appointment can literally be the difference between life and death.”But here’s where Asamoah’s insight becomes powerful. The same data driven approach that saves mothers can track the invisible spread of killer bacteria.Her second major research project proposes a global surveillance network that integrates clinical records, genomic sequences, environmental monitoring, social media reports, and human movement patterns. Machine learning algorithms analyze these diverse data streams to spot resistance patterns emerging in real time.The results from pilot programs worldwide are startling. Urban metagenomic surveillance detected unknown antimicrobial resistance genes in 60 cities across six continents. Veterinary systems in Australia identified emerging resistance in animals six months before similar patterns appeared in humans. Real time clinical platforms cut detection time for unusual infection patterns from weeks to under 48 hours.Machine learning models can now process this information simultaneously and identify resistance hotspots with 85 to 92 percent accuracy. Environmental reservoirs in urban transit systems showed resistance gene prevalence rates up to 300 percent higher than in nearby hospitals. Wastewater monitoring detected resistant bacteria weeks before they appeared in clinical infections.What connects her two research projects is the recognition that prevention beats treatment, but only if you’re looking in the right places.“Traditional health systems wait for problems to arrive at the hospital door,” Asamoah says. “But hospitals are where people go when prevention has already failed. If we want to stop deaths, we need to intervene earlier, and data shows us exactly when and where to act.”Yet her research exposes a troubling reality. The same technologies that could save millions of lives are being deployed unevenly. Sub Saharan Africa, where maternal mortality rates are highest and antibiotic resistance is growing fastest, has less than five percent of global genomic sequencing capacity.Mobile health programs that work brilliantly in connected cities fail in rural areas with unreliable electricity and internet. Sophisticated algorithms trained on data from rich countries miss patterns in poor ones.“We have the technology. We have the data,” Asamoah says. “But we’re not deploying it where it’s needed most, which happens to be where these problems are killing the most people.”Her background gives her a unique perspective. Growing up in Ghana, she witnessed firsthand the healthcare gaps that claim lives. Now, through her pharmaceutical analytics training, she’s demonstrating how data science could close those gaps.But she’s equally clear about limitations. For maternal health, power cuts, poor connectivity, low literacy, and cultural barriers remain massive obstacles. For antimicrobial surveillance, data quality varies wildly, with missing entries in clinical databases ranging from 15 to 40 percent.“Technology isn’t a magic solution,” she cautions. “Without proper implementation, we risk creating new inequities where only urban populations benefit while rural communities fall further behind.”Her research identifies what actually works. For maternal health: involving communities in design, training local workers, ensuring systems function offline, and adapting to local languages. For superbug surveillance: integrating diverse data sources, using algorithms that account for incomplete data, and establishing clear privacy frameworks.The political obstacles are immense. Who pays for global surveillance when benefits are shared but costs are local? Who controls data when a resistant strain detected in one country threatens another?Asamoah argues these questions cannot excuse inaction. “Every day we delay, mothers die who could have been saved by a text message. Patients die from infections we could have seen coming if we’d been monitoring wastewater. These aren’t hypothetical future deaths. They’re happening right now.”Her approach to antimicrobial resistance surveillance represents a paradigm shift. Traditional antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems wait for pathogens to appear in hospitals, but Asamoah’s framework tracks resistance genes in the environment, creating a true early warning system. This multi-source antimicrobial resistance surveillance integrates data that conventional systems ignore.Her work demonstrates that preventing health crises requires treating surveillance as a global commons, like climate monitoring, rather than a patchwork of national systems with blind spots at every border.“A superbug emerging in a Ghanaian farm can kill someone in a London hospital within months. A mother dying in rural India represents a failure of the same systems that should protect pregnant women in New York,” she explains. “We’re all connected, whether we acknowledge it or not.”What makes her perspective valuable is her refusal to separate technical solutions from questions of equity. She understands that the most sophisticated algorithm is useless if it doesn’t reach the people who need it most.Her vision is ambitious but grounded in evidence. A world where every pregnant woman receives personalized digital support. Where resistant bacteria are detected and contained before they reach hospitals. Where doctors make decisions guided by real time global data.The infrastructure exists. Mobile penetration in developing countries has created an enabling environment. Cloud computing makes global integration feasible. Genomic sequencing costs have dropped 99 percent in a decade.What remains missing is political will.“We can see all of these threats coming if we choose to look,” she says. “The data is screaming warnings at us. Text messages can save mothers. Toilet water can predict pandemics. The question is whether we’re willing to act on what we already know.”The uncomfortable genius of her work is showing that we’ve had the tools to solve these crises all along. We’ve just been too blind, too siloed, or too unwilling to invest in solutions that would primarily benefit the world’s poorest populations.Now the data is undeniable. The mothers are still dying, the superbugs are still spreading, and the warnings Asamoah has uncovered are getting louder every day.Tags: Abena Ntim AsamoahAbena Ntim Asamoah antimicrobial resistance maternal mortality digital health global health surveillance superbug detection mHealth interventionsantimicrobial resistanceDigital healthglobal healthhealth interventionsMaternal mortalitysuperbug detectionsurveillance",Emmanuel Owusu,,"November 18, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/ghanaian-researcher-revolutionizes-antimicrobial-resistance-surveillance-globally/
Dont blindly trust what AI tells you  Googles Sundar Pichai,"People should not “blindly trust” everything AI tools tell them, the boss of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told the BBC.In an exclusive interview, chief executive Sundar Pichai said that AI models are “prone to errors” and urged people to use them alongside other tools.Mr Pichai said it highlighted the importance of having a rich information ecosystem, rather than solely relying on AI technology.“This is why people also use Google search, and we have other products that are more grounded in providing accurate information.”While AI tools were helpful “if you want to creatively write something”, Mr Pichai said people “have to learn to use these tools for what they’re good at, and not blindly trust everything they say”.He told the BBC: “We take pride in the amount of work we put in to give us as accurate information as possible, but the current state-of-the-art AI technology is prone to some errors.”‘A new phase’The tech world has been awaiting the latest launch of Google’s consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, which is starting to win back market share from ChatGPT.Since May this year, Google began introducing a new “AI Mode” into its search, integrating its Gemini chatbot, which is aimed at giving users the experience of talking to an expert.At the time, Mr Pichai said the integration of Gemini with search signalled a “new phase of the AI platform shift”.The move is also part of the tech giant’s bid to remain competitive against AI services such as ChatGPT, which have threatened Google’s online search dominance.His comments back up BBC research from earlier this year, which found that AI chatbots inaccurately summarised news stories.OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Copilot, Google’s Gemini, and Perplexity AI were all given content from the BBC website and asked questions about it, and the research found the AI answers contained “significant inaccuracies”.In his interview with the BBC, Mr Pichai said there was some tension between how fast technology was being developed and how mitigations are built in to prevent potential harmful effects.For Alphabet, Mr Pichai said managing that tension means being ” bold and responsible at the same time”.“So we are moving fast through this moment. I think our consumers are demanding it,” he said.The tech giant has also increased its investment in AI security in proportion with its investment in AI, Mr Pichai added.“For example, we are open-sourcing technology which will allow you to detect whether an image is generated by AI,” he said.Asked about recently uncovered years-old comments from tech billionaire Elon Musk to OpenAI’s founders around fears the now Google-owned DeepMind could create an AI “dictatorship”, Mr Pichai said “no one company should own a technology as powerful as AI”.But he added that there were many companies in the AI ecosystem today.“If there was only one company that was building AI technology and everyone else had to use it, I would be concerned about that too, but we are so far from that scenario right now,” he said.Source: BBC.comTags: AIGhana NewsGoogleSundar Pichai",Citi Newsroom,,"November 18, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/dont-blindly-trust-what-ai-tells-you-googles-sundar-pichai/

CERPA reviews 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy,"IntroductionThe 2026 Budget, presented to Parliament by the Minister for Finance on 13 November 2025, is the second budget of the NDC administration under the “Reset Agenda.” Themes of fiscal discipline, macroeconomic stability, and job creation dominated the budget, which is anchored on “Resetting for Growth, Jobs, and Economic Transformation.” This document presents a review of the budget statement delivered on behalf of the President. The review outlines (i) a snapshot of macroeconomic performance for 2025 and the target for 2026, (ii) the key highlights of the budget, (iii) its strengths and weaknesses, and (iv) our concluding opinions and the implications of the budget. Snapshot of Macroeconomic Performance GDP Growth (%)Indicator2024Q12025Q12024H1 (June)2025H1(June)2025Proj Q1-Q42026TargetOverall GDP4.95.35.16.34.84.8Non-oil GDP4.36.85.67.85.34.9Note: Q1= quarter one, H1= first half of the year, and Proj= projected Fiscal BalanceIndicator2025Target (revised)ProjQ1 – Q3OutturnQ1 – Q3ProjQ1 – Q4Target for 2026Total Revenue and Grants (billions of GH¢)229.9162.6154.9226.4268Total Expenditure (billions of GH¢)269.4206.9178.4251.7302.4Primary Balance (Commitment basis)1.5%0.6%1.6%1.8%1.5%Overall Fiscal Deficit (Commitment basis)-2.8%-3.2%-1.5%-1.8%-2.2%Note: Proj= projected  Price Development Cedi Performance (Inter-Bank Rate)Indicator 10th November 202410th November 2025US DollarGH¢16.35GH¢10.92British PoundGH¢21.09GH¢14.37EuroGH¢17.50GH¢12.62 Public Debt Development Key highlights of the budgetHere are some key or notable features of the 2026 Fiscal Budget:Revenue Target: The government aims to collect GH¢268.1 billion in total revenue and grants, representing an 18.3% increase from the 2025 amount of GH¢229.9 billion.Expenditure Target: The government plans to spend GH¢302.4 billion in 2026, representing a 12.2% increase over the 2025 allocation of GH¢269.4 billion.Fiscal Discipline: The budget prioritises fiscal discipline, targeting a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP and an overall deficit of 2.2% of GDP.Economic Growth: Ghana’s economy is projected to grow by 4.8% in 2026, supported by improved fiscal discipline and ambitious development priorities. This exceeds the 2025 growth target of 4.0%.Inflation: Inflation is expected to stay within the target band of 8% with a margin of error of ±2 percent.Tax Reforms: The budget introduces several tax reforms, including the abolition of the COVID-19 levy and decoupling of GETFund and NHIL levies from the VAT Tax base. It also abolishes VAT on mineral exploration and extends zero-rated VAT on local textiles to 2028.Public Debt Management: Key actions include rebuilding the Sinking Fund to create buffers for future repayments, conducting debt reprofiling and bond buy-backs to reduce high-cost obligations, limiting non-concessional borrowing to only strategic projects, and improving transparency through regular publication of debt operations.Social Protection: The budget prioritises social protection, with allocations for free SHS, NHIS, LEAP, and school feeding programmes.Infrastructure Development: The budget includes investments in infrastructure, including the Big Push Infrastructure Programme.Job Creation: The government aims to create over 800,000 jobs in 2026 through infrastructure projects, TVET expansion, and the 24-Hour Economy initiative. Observed Strengths and Weaknesses Based on the notable features of the 2026 Fiscal budget, here are some strengths and weaknesses of the budget: Strengths Revenue Mobilisation: The budget targets e-commerce, cross-border digital transactions which encapsulate a broad and modern source of revenue mobilisation. The budget also projects non-oil domestic revenue to increase to 15.7% of GDP in 2026 from 15.1% projected for 2025, through tighter enforcement and the digitalisation of tax administration.Government Expenditure: Government plans to increase spending by 12.2% in 2026, signaling an expansionary fiscal policy. This is expected to support the needed economic growth, provided the required revenues are mobilised to finance the higher expenditure.Fiscal Discipline: The budget prioritises fiscal discipline, targeting a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP and an overall deficit of 2.2% of GDP, an improvement from the 2.8% projected for 2025 and 7.9% outturn recorded at end-December 2024. This aligns with the amended Public Financial Management Act (2025) and the IMF-supported programme.Macroeconomic Stability: The budget aims to sustain macroeconomic stability, with single-digit inflation and exchange rate stability, preserving gains made in 2025. Debts: The government’s debt management approach which focuses on extending maturities, reducing borrowing costs, and strengthening credibility represents a positive shift in overall debt management.Social Protection: The budget maintains funding for social protection programs, including the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) program, National Health Insurance Scheme, and School Feeding Programme. WeaknessesRevenue Assumptions: The budget’s ambitious fiscal targets hinge on optimistic revenue projections that may prove difficult to achieve, particularly given Ghana’s persistent tax compliance challenges. Notably, the government missed its revenue target for Q1–Q3 by GH¢7.7 billion, underscoring the risks associated with these assumptions.Fiscal Gaps: The budget has underlying fiscal gaps, with rising interest obligations, and a balancing gap, requiring additional borrowing to finance interest costs and priority programmes. Crowding-out Effect: The budget poses a significant risk of crowding-out private sector activity, as increased domestic borrowing could constrain credit availability and raise lending costs. This may slow job creation, weaken industrial growth, and undermine broader economic transformation efforts. Job Creation: Although the projected creation of 800,000 jobs is commendable, concerns remain about their sustainability, as a significant share is linked to construction-related activities under the Big Push and other infrastructure programmes. Limited Transformational Vision: The budget falls short of articulating a clear transformational agenda, with minimal emphasis on productive investment. Its orientation remains largely toward fiscal consolidation rather than catalytic, growth-enhancing expansion. Poverty Reduction: The 2026 Budget does not present a clear poverty-reduction framework. Although the budget references various social protection initiatives, it does not provide a coherent matrix outlining how these policies and programmes will directly alleviate poverty among vulnerable groups. The document lacks measurable targets, timelines, and defined implementation pathways for reducing poverty, making it difficult to assess how proposed interventions will translate into meaningful improvements in the welfare of low-income households Conclusive Opinion and ImplicationsThe 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of Ghana presents a mixed picture, with both strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the budget prioritises fiscal discipline, targeting a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP and an overall deficit of 2.2% of GDP, aligning with the amended Public Financial Management Act and the IMF-supported programme.The budget also prioritises social protection and investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare, with a focus on promoting economic growth and reducing inequality. The “Big Push Infrastructure Programme” and the “24-Hour Economy” initiative are notable examples of this.However, concerns have been raised about the potential crowding-out effect of domestic borrowing, which could slow job creation, weaken industrial growth, and undermine economic transformation efforts.The budget’s ambitious fiscal targets also hinge on optimistic revenue assumptions, which may be challenging to achieve given Ghana’s persistent tax compliance issues and limited diversification of the revenue base. This may worsen the projected fiscal gap, forcing the government to resort to debt financing.Overall, the 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of Ghana is a credible attempt to consolidate macroeconomic stability, accelerate job creation, and protect social progress; however, its success will depend on effective execution, realistic revenue strategies, and institutional accountability. Tags: 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policyand Economic TransformationArticleCERPAEconomic GrowthGhanaGhana NewsjobsPublic Debt ManagementResetting for GrowthRevenue target",Citi Newsroom,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/cerpa-reviews-2026-budget-statement-and-economic-policy/
Ghanas Auto Import Charges: A long list of levies driving costs through the roof,"For many Ghanaians, buying a car has become an increasingly expensive decision, whether brand new or used. While global supply chain shocks, currency depreciation, and inflation are often cited as the main culprits, a lesser-known but equally significant factor lies in the long list of taxes, fees, and statutory charges imposed at Ghana’s ports.A typical Bill of Entry for a vehicle import reveals more than 20 different taxes, levies, and charges, many of which are applied regardless of the age, type, or value of the vehicle. Even when some items show “0.00” during exemptions or special waivers, they remain mandatory cost components for most importers.Collectively, these charges make Ghana one of the most expensive destinations to clear vehicles in West Africa.
Here is a breakdown of these charges and why stakeholders say the cumulative effect is prohibitive.1. The Core Taxes That Drive Up CostsA number of major taxes form the backbone of Ghana’s vehicle import regime:
Import Duty (Code 01)This is a major component of clearance costs, calculated on the CIF value of the vehicle. Rates vary by vehicle type and capacity, but they significantly raise the base clearing cost.Import VAT (02) and Import NHIL (47)The standard VAT and National Health Insurance Levy charged on imports. When combined with other VAT-related charges, importers complain that VAT is applied multiple times in the clearance chain.ECOWAS Levy (06)A community levy paid on imports into ECOWAS member countries. While relatively small, it adds to the cumulative expense.Special Import Levy – SIL (78)
A 2% levy originally introduced as a temporary measure but now part of the port tax ecosystem.1% Withholding Tax on Imports (56)
Usually applied to registered businesses, this reduces immediate cash flow and adds to upfront port costs.2. Administrative and Agency FeesThese charges are attached to specific regulatory or public service agencies:
Processing Fee (05)A general administrative charge paid on every import declaration.Vehicle Examination Fee (31)
Charged for physical inspection of vehicles.Vehicle Certification Fee (16)
Paid when DVLA certifies the imported vehicle prior to registration.Ghana Shippers Authority SNF Fee (45)
A statutory fee supporting the operations and regulatory work of the Shippers Authority.MoTI e-IDF Fee (72)
The electronic import declaration fee mandated by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.GHS Disinfection Fee (63)Introduced during the peak of COVID-19, this fee initially covered disinfection of cargo. Importers argue that the persistence of such charges beyond the emergency period is unnecessary.3. Network and System ChargesThese technology-related fees have become some of the most controversial:
Network Charge (32)
Network Charge VAT (33)
Network Charge NHIL (48)
Network Charge GETFund Levy (89)
COVID-19 Network Charge (39)
The “network charge” cluster relates to fees imposed for the use of the Integrated Customs Management System (ICUMS). Importers argue that applying VAT, NHIL, GETFund, and other levies on top of a technology service fee results in cascading taxes, effectively taxing the same item multiple times.4. Social and Public Policy LeviesThese levies are intended to fund national development initiatives:
GETFund Import Levy (88)
EXIM Bank Levy (87)
African Union Import Levy (98)
COVID-19 Health Recovery Levy (99)
Upfront VAT for Unregistered Importers (101)
Individually, these may not be large percentages, but together they greatly inflate the overall cost of bringing a vehicle into Ghana.Why These Charges Are Seen as Prohibitive1. Cumulative Effect
While some levies appear minor on their own, the combined effect is substantial. A vehicle valued at $10,000 can attract total clearing costs that approach or even exceed the value of the vehicle, depending on engine capacity and age.2. Cascading Taxes
VAT-related charges are applied several times, on the value of the vehicle, on network fees, and sometimes on other levies, creating a compounded tax effect.3. Lack of Harmonisation Across Agencies
Multiple government agencies impose independent fees, creating redundancy and inefficiencies.4. High Port Charges Reduce Competitiveness
Ghana’s ports are increasingly seen as less competitive compared with neighbouring countries.Comparing Ghana’s Port Charges With Other West African Countries
Nigeria – More Competitive Despite Its Challenges
Despite Nigeria’s economic difficulties, clearing a used vehicle at Lagos or Port Harcourt often costs significantly less than in Ghana. Nigeria also applies fewer digital-system charges, and the country has aggressively reviewed auto import taxes to attract more port volumes.Togo (Lomé) – The Region’s Transit LeaderLomé Port is widely considered the most competitive in West Africa. This is due to lower automobile import duties, fewer administrative levies, faster clearance processes, heavy reliance on transit cargo, especially to landlocked neighbours.Many Ghanaian importers take advantage of this by routing vehicles through Lomé and then transporting them into Ghana. Ironically, this results in Ghana losing significant revenue to Togo.Benin (Cotonou) – A Popular Destination for Auto Imports
Benin has positioned Cotonou as a “vehicle import hub” by: reducing import duties, streamlining port processes, removing redundant fees.
As a result, many West African auto dealers source and clear vehicles through Cotonou, not Ghana.Industry Concerns: Ghana Is Losing OutStakeholders in Ghana’s automobile import ecosystem consistently argue that:
The long list of taxes and levies discourages vehicle importation.
Port costs are pushing importers to use neighbouring countries.
Government revenue is indirectly reduced because overly high charges divert business away from Ghana.
The average Ghanaian pays more for used cars due to high port charges.
Local auto dealers warn that the market continues to shrink as vehicles become unaffordable for many consumers.The Way ForwardThe prices of vehicles on the local market are significantly impacted by two key factors which are the exchange rate and port-related import duties. For years, a weakening cedi has led to higher costs for both importers and buyers.Due to this, there is already growing pressure from customers who are demanding price reductions in line with the cedi’s appreciation.According to vehicle dealers, current retail prices remain high because the cars were imported when the exchange rate was less favourable.Second Hand Car Dealers Association argue that although they expect that future imports will be more affordable, due to the appreciation, maintaining the current import duty regime will be ineffective.
Industry players are calling for:1. A comprehensive review of all automobile import levies
2. Harmonisation of agency charges
3. Reduction of cascading VAT on service fees
4. Competitive benchmarking across West African ports
5. A shift from revenue-maximisation to trade-facilitation
Until these reforms happen, clearing a car in Ghana will remain one of the costliest in the subregion and consumers will continue to bear the burden. Source: Sheba Araba Bennin/Channel One Research DeskTags: Abossey OkaiEconomyECOWASFees and ChargesGhana Auto ImportGhana Newsspare partsVAT",Sheba Araba Bennin,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/ghanas-auto-import-charges-a-long-list-of-levies-driving-costs-through-the-roof/
"Food glut, tomato scarcity: Why Ghana has too much rice but not enough tomatoes","Across many rice-growing belts in Ghana from Fumbisi in the Upper East Region to Nasia in the North East and Ohiamadwen in the Western Region, farmers are watching mountains of bagged paddy rice sit idle in warehouses. This season has produced one of the largest gluts of locally grown rice in years, yet thousands of bags remain unsold.The government tried to mop up this excess with GHS 200 million, but this amount has been described as “drop in the ocean,” by the National Food Buffer Stock Company, who requested around GHS 700 million to buy up excess rice and maize.Ironically, while Ghana has more rice than it can absorb in the short term, the country is battling an acute scarcity of tomatoes. Markets are overflowing with plantain, cassava and garden eggs, but fresh tomatoes, are scarce and expensive. The two extremes show a food system that swings between surplus and shortage, putting both farmers and consumers under stress.This feature explores how Ghana arrived at this troubling imbalance, why rice farmers are struggling to survive even amid bumper harvests, and why tomatoes remain out of reach for many households.A Country of Contradiction: Too Much Rice, Too Few TomatoesThe word “glut” has been used many times in Ghana’s food conversations, but nowhere is it more evident today than in the country’s rice sector. Several regions have recorded bumper harvests, especially after years of sustained cultivation under agricultural programmes and expansions in irrigated rice fields. But without enough buyers, processors or storage facilities, the output has outstripped market demand. Farmers in Fumbisi, for instance, say that out of thousands of bags harvested, only a fraction has been purchased by market actors.Meanwhile, tomatoes, one of the most widely consumed vegetables, are scarce. In major markets in Accra and Kumasi, traders display tall heaps of cassava, plantain and garden eggs, but offer only small portions of tomatoes at painful prices. A small bowl of tomatoes can cost more than an entire bunch of plantain. Meanwhile, in September 2025, the government had to step in to purchase 1,000 boxes of tomatoes and 2,000 bags of onions cultivated by farmers in the Ashanti Region due to abundance.The market seems to be screaming two messages at once: Ghana cannot manage abundance, and it cannot prevent scarcity.Rice Glut: How We Produced Too Much Without a MarketThis year’s rice glut is the climax of several intersecting factors:1. Expanded Production Encouraged by Previous SuccessAfter earlier years of strong demand for local rice, many farmers increased their acreage. Government programmes under Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ), combined with improved seed varieties and expanded irrigation in schemes like Tono and Vea, boosted production. Farmers invested heavily buying fertiliser, hiring labour, and renting harvesters, expecting a profitable season.2. Lack of Storage and Processing CapacityThough Ghana repeatedly encourages consumption of local rice, the country still lacks sufficient milling and storage capacity. The absence of a robust warehouse receipt system means farmers cannot store paddy for future sale or use it as collateral for financing.3. Competition from Imported RiceDespite campaign after campaign promoting “Eat Ghana Rice,” imported rice continues to dominate the market. Urban consumers often prefer the uniformity and appearance of imported brands, making it difficult for local rice to compete. This season, rice importers have not slowed down, so farmers are battling both oversupply and weaker demand.Why Tomatoes Are Scarce: Seasonal and Structural RealitiesIf rice shows Ghana’s problem with abundance, tomatoes show its ongoing struggle with scarcity. Tomato production faces a unique set of challenges that make the country chronically dependent on imports.1. Seasonal Production and Climate PressuresTomato farming in Ghana is tied to specific cycles. Regions like Akomadan, Tuobodom, and the northern irrigation schemes produce tomatoes only during peak seasons when conditions are right. This year, irregular rainfall and heat waves disrupted expected yields. Pest outbreaks, especially the notorious Tuta Absoluta in Nigeria, wiped out large acres of tomato farms.2. Dependence on Imports From Burkina Faso and NigerGhana relies heavily on fresh tomatoes from Burkina Faso and Niger during the lean season. When production or logistics issues hit those countries, Ghana feels the pinch immediately. Recent insecurity and high transport costs on the Burkina Faso–Ghana corridor have limited supply and increased spoilage.3. Weak Local Production SystemsTomato farmers currently operate in an environment where: irrigation systems are inadequate, farm inputs are unaffordable, storage systems are non-existent, and market linkages are weak.The Root of Ghana’s Food ImbalanceGhana’s seasonal food imbalance, excess of some crops and shortage of others, comes from deeper systemic gaps.1. Poor Market ForecastingFarmers often make production decisions based on the previous year’s prices rather than data-driven projections. If plantain or rice sold well last year, many switch to it, creating oversupply the following year.
2. Limited Storage and ProcessingGhana loses between 30 and 50 percent of fresh produce annually due to weak storage infrastructure. When gluts occur, these losses worsen. Without cold-chain systems or warehousing, produce floods the market at once, causing prices to fall.3. Fragmented Value ChainsWhile some crops like rice require structured buyers and processors, many farming regions operate without organised market linkages. The tomato sector is especially vulnerable because of lack of processing factories after the collapse of facilities like the Pwalugu Tomato Factory.4. Over-Reliance on Regional ImportsFor tomatoes especially, overdependence on Burkina Faso and Niger exposes Ghana to external risks. A disruption there immediately destabilises supply here.How the Glut and Scarcity Affect Farmers and ConsumersDespite bumper harvests, many farmers are struggling. Some are forced to sell below cost just to clear their fields, while others watch crops rot in the absence of proper storage. At the same time, urban consumers are paying the price, tomatoes are expensive, pushing households to rely on substitutes like tomato paste or garden-egg stews.Traders, struggling with high spoilage rates, unstable bulk prices, and rising transport costs, pass these expenses on to shoppers. The result is a distorted market where farmers lose, and consumers don’t necessarily gain.What Experts SayAgricultural economists argue that Ghana’s problem is not production capacity but coordination and infrastructure. The Chief Executive Officer of Agri-Impact, Daniel Fahene Acquaye, has urged the government to adopt long-term policies rather than temporary interventions that ensure consistent support for local rice, maize, and poultry producers.Some tomato traders say stabilising the Burkina Faso trade route is essential for short-term relief, but long-term solutions like storage and proper logistics would reduce heavy losses. Without these, they warn that even abundant.The Way Forward: A More Balanced Food System1. Government Purchase and Buffering of Surplus RiceBuying locally grown for school feeding programmes, buffer stocks and institutional consumption can stabilise prices and prevent wastage. President Mahama has ordered public institutions to prioritise locally produced food to help absorb the current harvest surplus. Schools and prisons are now required to source all their food locally, and excess eggs and grains are being directed into the School Feeding Programme to support farmers and help them recover their investments.2. Expand Irrigation and Greenhouse Cultivation for TomatoesExpanding irrigation in major tomato-growing zones like Akomadan, Afram Plains, Tono and Vea, remains one of the most reliable ways to secure year-round production and avoid Ghana’s recurring tomato shortages. The collapse of the Pwalugu Irrigation Project, which left farmers dependent on rainfall stands as a reminder of what happens when such investments stall.3. Invest in Storage, Milling and Processing FacilitiesModern rice mills, cold storage facilities, and reactivation of tomato processing factories are essential to balance the market.4. Implement a National Crop Forecasting SystemA centralised agricultural data platform can guide farmers on the crops that will be profitable and prevent herd production.5. Strengthen Regional Trade RoutesFormalising cross-border tomato trade can reduce logistics disruptions and stabilise prices for consumers.ConclusionGhana’s simultaneous rice glut and tomato scarcity reveal a food system struggling with coordination, infrastructure and resilience. Farmers who should be celebrating bumper rice harvests are pleading for intervention, while consumers scrambling for basic tomato supplies are spending more than they can afford.With deliberate planning, improved storage, strong irrigation and market intelligence, Ghana can turn this irony into balance, ensuring that abundance translates into prosperity for farmers and stable prices for consumers. Source: Sheba Araba Bennin/Channel One Research DeskTags: AgriFairEconomyfood glutGhana NewsRice glutTomatoes",Sheba Araba Bennin,,"November 24, 2025",https://citinewsroom.com/2025/11/food-glut-tomato-scarcity-why-ghana-has-too-much-rice-but-not-enough-tomatoes/
