Expect no real change  Former Minister critiques Mahamas first two budgets,"Former Minister of Information under the previous administration and lawyer, Hon. Fatimatu Abubakar has cast doubt on the ability of President John Mahama’s administration to deliver meaningful economic change, stating that the first two budgets presented offer no indication of improvement in the lives of ordinary Ghanaians. “What I am seeing now with the first and second budgets is that nothing is coming,” she said. “Those hoping for change will be disappointed.” She stressed. According to her, the administration’s priorities appear misplaced, and economic relief measures, including a possible reduction in electricity tariffs, seem unlikely.“They will not reduce electricity tariffs,” she noted. “Instead, they are using money meant for the 24-hour economy initiative to purchase a private jet.” She argued that the heavy focus on high-profile prosecutions is politically motivated and has little to do with genuine economic reform. “All the prosecutions going on are just to keep the media busy,” she claimed. “We already know how the court issues will end because politics is everywhere.” Abubakar said the government’s current posture suggests more attention is being placed on erasing the achievements of the previous administration than on building a credible economic recovery plan. “What is happening is an attempt to wipe off the legacy of the previous administration,” she said.

Fatimatu Abubakar warns of growing threat to independent state institutions,"Hon. Fatimatu Abubakar, a former Information Minister, has expressed deep concern about what she believes is a growing threat to the independence of Ghana’s constitutional and state institutions under the current administration. According to her, Ghana’s political space has become so polarised that each change in government leads to an unhealthy scramble by public institutions to prove loyalty to the new regime.“When a new government comes, there is that desire to fall on each other just to please the current administration so that they will not be touched,” she said. “Even in constitutional and independent bodies, the pressure to show loyalty is becoming dangerous.” She disclosed. She pointed to recent actions by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) as an example of what she described as excessive political enthusiasm. “They are making it look as if they couldn’t work under the previous government,” she explained. “But I don’t even know that office. If I were going there, I would need Google Maps. They had funding and resources in the past and didn’t do much, but suddenly they are acting as though Akufo-Addo forced them not to work.” The private legal practitioner added. Abubakar warned that any government seeking to consolidate all arms of state power, especially without room for dissent, poses a risk to democratic stability.“This is very dangerous for this country because any leader seeking to consolidate all the arms of government without room for defence is embarking on a suicide mission,” she stressed. She contrasted the conduct of the current administration with former President Akufo-Addo’s decision to appoint Martin Amidu as the first Special Prosecutor. “When Akufo-Addo appointed Martin Amidu, people criticised it,” she recalled. “But the President wasn’t looking for someone he could influence. He wanted someone competent, someone who wouldn’t bow to pressure.” She stressed. Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Mahama using 24-Hour economy funds to buy private jet  Hon. Fatimatu Abubakar,"Ghanaian politician and lawyer, Hon. Fatimatu Abubakar, has accused President John Mahama of misusing funds allocated to the 24-hour economy initiative, claiming that part of the money has been diverted to purchase a private jet. Speaking in an interview on Movement TV monitored by MyNewsGh.com, she alleged that the new administration was already showing signs of misplacement of priorities. “Those who were expecting change should forget it,” she asserted. “They are using some of the 24-hour economy money to buy a private jet. They won’t be able to reduce electricity tariffs, and nothing significant will happen with these first and second budgets.” She claimed According to her, the prosecutions currently happening under the Mahama administration are merely intended to create media noise without real impact. “All the prosecutions are just making the media busy,” she said. “We already know how these court issues will end because politics has taken over everything. You don’t even need to read petitions or hear both sides; the ending is predictable.” She added She warned that the pattern of governance emerging under the new administration reflects an attempt to completely dismantle the legacy of former President Akufo-Addo.“What is happening under this administration is that they totally want to wipe off the legacy of the previous government,” she insisted.

Bawumia hails Star Oils adoption of credit system in fuel purchasing,"Former Vice President of Ghana, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, has congratulated Star Oil Ghana Limited for buying into his idea, which was massively rejected by the Ghanaian people. According to him, although skeptics did not see it as possible when he launched the initiative, a credit economy is so vital in making life a lot less stressful for many people in advanced economies. He explained that Ghana has already laid the critical foundational pillars to underpin an efficient credit economy using the Ghanacard as an anchor, and supported by pillars such as the digital address system, the interoperable mobile money payment system, and the individualized credit scoring system. The former vice president said he’s looking forward to other OMCs replicating what Star Oil has introduced. I congratulate StarOil Ghana Ltd, and its bold and visionary CEO, for launching their Fuel Now, Pay Later scheme today, which makes it possible for Ghanaians, especially drivers, to be able to buy fuel on credit using their Ghanacard through the individualised credit scoring system. When I launched this initiative last year, many skeptics did not see it as possible. A credit economy is so vital in making life a lot less stressful for many people in advanced economies. Thankfully, in Ghana we have put in place the critical foundational pillars to underpin an efficient credit economy using the Ghanacard as an anchor, and supported by pillars such as the digital address system, our interoperable mobile money payment system, and the individualized credit scoring system. I look forward to other OMCs and businesses embracing the individualised credit scoring system to give Ghanaian workers the much-needed option of buying goods and services on credit and paying for them with ease through their Ghanacard and credit score as Star Oil Ghana has done.

Parliament formally notifies EC of vacancy for Kpandai rerun,"The Clerk to Parliament, Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror, has formally notified the Electoral Commission (EC) of a vacancy in the membership of Parliament following a High Court order directing a rerun of the Kpandai Parliamentary Elections. In a letter addressed to EC Chairperson Mrs. Jean Mensa and dated December 4, 2025, the Clerk stated: “I, EBENEZER AHUMAH DJIETROR, the Clerk to Parliament, DO HEREBY FORMALLY NOTIFY you of the occurrence of a vacancy in the membership of Parliament, occasioned by the Order of the High Court, Tamale, for a rerun of the Kpandai Parliamentary Elections, given on the 24th day of November, 2025.” The notification follows the service of a court order identifying him as the 4th Respondent in the case Suit Numbered: NR/TL/HC/E13/22/25, with the Clerk noting, “Accordingly, notice is hereby given.”   Meanwhile, sitting Kpandai MP Mathew Nyindam has ‘ran’ to the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the High Court’s annulment of his December 2024 parliamentary victory. Nyindam argues that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by NDC candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal, insisting that the challenge was filed out of time. Under Section 18 of the Representation of the People Law, 1992, election petitions must be filed within 21 days of gazetting results; however, Wakpal’s petition was filed 32 days after the gazette. In his affidavit, Nyindam contends: “The Parliamentary Election Petition filed by the 1st Interested Party on 25th January 2025… was invalid and could not have properly invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court.” The High Court ruling on November 24, 2025, annulled the results and ordered a rerun—triggering the Clerk’s letter to the Electoral Commission. Nyindam is now seeking certiorari to quash the judgment and related proceedings. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the matter on December 16, 2025 as the legal dispute surrounding the Kpandai seat deepens.

Please dont let him down  KSM urges Mahamas team to prioritise service over self-interest,"Kwaku Sintim-Misa (KSM) has also called on appointees serving under President John Dramani Mahama to demonstrate loyalty, discipline and integrity as the administration returns to office. He said the president cannot deliver on his mandate without the full support of his team. According to him, “he has come back and Ghanaians are saying we believe in you… but he can’t do it alone. “He needs his appointees to back him.” KSM appealed to the president’s team, saying, “please, don’t let him down.” He urged appointees to focus on doing genuine work, emphasising that any benefits that come from good service are acceptable, but should never be the objective. “There’s a difference between when you do some good work and some dividends come out of the good work… enjoy the dividends,” he said on his Unfiltered show during an interview with Bridget Otoo,. “But don’t go into it with an agenda to loot.” KSM stressed that he would personally call out officials who misuse their positions. “The only time I mention names is when I see a looter,” he said. “Then I’ll come and tell JM, ‘Let this man go.’” He added that with public trust renewed, the administration’s success will hinge on appointees who “know what he’s looking for and back him.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Shine your eyes  KSM cautions Mahama against liabilities dressed as assets,"Kwaku Sintim-Misa (KSM) has cautioned President John Dramani Mahama to be vigilant about individuals who may present themselves as assets while posing real threats to his administration. Speaking on his Unfiltered show monitored by MyNewsGh, KSM said political leaders often face the danger of “liabilities dressed as assets.” He stated that, “the most dangerous thing you can encounter is when a liability comes dressed as an asset.” KSM added that once a leader assumes office, “you have all these liabilities who will come to you dressed as assets… and trust me, they are liabilities.” According to him, President Mahama “should shine his eye and take them out when he spots the liabilities immediately.” He claimed that such individuals do not contribute meaningfully to leadership but instead “drain you and take away.” KSM referenced past political experiences to illustrate his point. He pointed to Ken Ofori-Atta as an example, describing him as “one of the most perfect liabilities ever that came dressed as an asset,” adding that although he publicly quoted the Bible and projected virtue, “he was the biggest, if not the biggest liability… a sanctimonious fraud.” He urged the president to maintain vigilance throughout his term, stressing that opportunists often occupy various portfolios and positions. “They don’t even have to be the minister of finance,” he said. “Wherever they are, they can still cause damage.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

"Stop the distractions, focus on your promises  Dennis Aboagye to NDC","Dennis Miracles Aboagye, spokesperson for former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, has urged the NDC government to focus on addressing national challenges instead of luxurious spending. “You said buying a plane was wrong because the country was poor. The country listens to you, trusts and votes massively for you. “Then under 11 months, you turn around to buy a more expensive Presidential jet. And you think this is funny?” Aboagye questioned in a post on Facebook sighted by MyNewsGh. He accused the government of neglecting critical public services while engaging in what he described as frivolous expenditures. “At the time you want to buy this luxurious Presidential jet, the nurses and teachers you promised automatic postings are still at home. You have terminated the employment of about 35,000 young Ghanaians as they struggle to survive on a daily basis,” he said. Aboagye also highlighted the economic strain on citizens. “You have burdened the citizens with over 28% increase in utilities. Inflation is down and the dollar is down and yet prices of goods are at an unprecedented high. Cost of living keeps rising,” he noted. He warned the government against ignoring public expectations, stressing the need for accountability. “Some of us are not surprised because we always knew what you were. Get serious, stop the distraction, and focus on delivering the promises you made to the people. Spending $60 million on a Presidential jet now is a sin, a crime, disrespectful to the people,” Aboagye concluded.

Miracles Aboagye slams $60 million presidential jet purchase,"The spokesperson for former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, Dennis Miracles Aboagye, has strongly criticised the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) over the purchase of a new Presidential jet. “It’s time for the NDC and its footsoldiers to stop the jokes and take this country seriously. The grace period is over, and the future of this country is at stake,” he said. Aboagye highlighted the government’s apparent reversal on its stance regarding presidential air travel. “You said renting a plane was wrong because the current presidential jet was in pristine condition. You said buying a plane was wrong because the country was poor. “Then under 11 months, you turn around to buy a more expensive Presidential jet for the President to bath and cook in the air? And you think this is funny?” He argued that such spending comes at the expense of essential public services. “At the time you want to buy this luxurious Presidential jet, you still have the nurses and teachers you promised automatic postings still at home. “You have burdened the citizens with over 28% increase in utilities. Inflation is down and dollar is down and yet prices of goods are at an unprecedented high. Cost of living keeps rising,” Aboagye stated. The opposition representative called on the government to focus on fulfilling its electoral promises. “Get serious, stop the distraction and focus on the job, focus on delivering on the specific promises you made to the people. “Spending $60 million to buy a Presidential jet at this time when you spoke against it barely 11 months ago is a sin, a crime, disrespectful to the people.

Theres no record of threats on the life of the Special ProsecutorInterior Ministry,"Ghana’s Interior Ministry has disclosed that the Special Prosecutor did not report any attempt on his life to the police or any security agencies in the country. According to a statement from the ministry, the special prosecutor, when contacted on the matter, disclosed that the attempts were in the past and not this year. The minister has therefore ordered a probe into the threats on his life and other allegations made by the Director of Strategy and Communications at the Office of the Special Prosecutor. The statement said, “Initial contacts with Mr Kissi Agyebeng have revealed that the assassination attempts on him, as claimed, happened before this year. There is no record or report of such threats against his life at any police station or at any of the state security agencies in the country.” Adding that “Since crime does not expire, the Ministry has ordered a full-scale investigation into the claim of assassination attempts. The Ministry has also ordered an investigation into the claim by Mr Samuel Appiah Darko that he was handcuffed and beaten by 17 police personnel”.

Interior Minister Orders Rapid Probe into Alleged Assassination Attempts Targeting Special Prosecutor,"The Interior Ministry says there is no report of threats on the life of Kissi Agyebeng, who occupies the office of the Special Prosecutor. In a statement issued on December 8, 2025, the ministry said initial contacts with Mr. Kissi Agyebeng have revealed that the assassination attempts on him, as claimed, happened before this year. The minister has therefore ordered a probe into the threats on the life of the special prosecutor. “Since crime does not expire, the Ministry has ordered a full-scale investigation into the claim of assassination attempts”. The probe comes after the Director of Strategy, Research, and Communications at the Office of the Special Prosecutor, Mr. Samuel Appiah Darko, mentioned the assassination attempt on Newsfile, a television station in Accra, on December 6, 2025. He also claimed on the same programme that he had been handcuffed and beaten by 17 police personnel. Read The Statement Below The attention of the Ministry of the Interior has been drawn to information that the Special Prosecutor (OSP), Mr. Kissi Agyebeng, has survived two assassination attempts while discharging his duties to the Republic. The Director of Strategy, Research, and Communications at the Office of the Special Prosecutor, Mr. Samuel Appiah Darko, mentioned the assassination attempt on Newsfile, a television station in Accra, on December 6, 2025. He also claimed on the same programme that he had been handcuffed and beaten by 17 police personnel. Beyond the security implications of these claims, such dangers to personnel of accountability institutions, if true, can undermine the government’s efforts to combat corruption, which have intensified since it took office. The Ministry has therefore taken up the matter with the seriousness it deserves. Here are some preliminary findings on the alleged assassination attempt: The Minister of Interior has further directed as follows: The Ministry will update the public on the outcome of these investigations and the actions to be taken. The Ministry of Interior reiterates its commitment to protecting all lives and properties to ensure that all Ghanaians can conduct all their lawful affairs without any fear for their safety.

Alan declined ministerial offer in 2001  Kufuor,"Former President John Agyekum Kufuor has finally broken his silence on an old rumour concerning his ‘right-hand’ man, Alan Kyerematen. According to him, Alan declined an invitation to join his first government in 2001, dismissing renewed claims that he backed Alan against Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in the NPP’s 2008 presidential primaries. Mr Kufuor said speculation about his alleged support has persisted without evidence. He explained that his outreach to Alan after the 2000 victory was based on competence, not an attempt to position him for future internal contests. “Even when we won power in the 2000 general elections, and I contacted him that I wanted to make him a Minister, he declined,” he told Delay in an interview, stressing that he never gave Alan a political advantage. “I never supported him against anybody.” He maintained that he stayed neutral during the 2008 race and allowed the party’s processes to run their course. Mr. Kufuor linked the discussion to his recent reflections on the NPP’s 2024 defeat, attributing the loss partly to policy decisions such as the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme, the PDS incident and the National Cathedral project, which he said fuelled public discontent.

Akufo-Addo Meant Mahama Not Bawumia When He Said Someone Better Will Fix the EconomyNDC Communicator,"NDC Communications Team Member, Theophilus Dzimega Jnr., Esq. has said that when Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo said someone better would come and take over the administration of the country and better the lot of the people, he meant John Dramani Mahama. According to him, the president’s delivery in the last year since his overwhelming endorsement from the Ghanaian people is a clear indication that Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo knew how capable he could be. To him, if Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo believed Dr Mahamudu Bawumia would win the 2024 election, he would have mentioned his name, but rather, the former president made an open statement because he knew clearly that Dr Mahamudu Bawumia could not turn the fortunes around for the people of Ghana. Theophilus Dzimega Jnr., Esq was speaking on Accra-based Joy Prime, where he was speaking on the current government’s achievements in their first year in office, when he made this known. “Truth of the matter is, this has been an overwhelming endorsement of the fact that we need change. In the last days of Nana Akufo-Addo he told us that someone better will come and take over and make the economy better. I don’t think he was talking about his Vice President. If he was talking about his Vice President he would have been straight to say my Vice President the economic wizard is going to take over and will make the economy better. No”.

NPPs defeat in 2024 was necessaryNana Ama Dokuah,"Former Member of Parliament for Akropong North, Nana Ama Dokuah Asiamah Adjei, says upon sober reflection, the defeat of the New Patriotic Party in the 2024 election was necessary. According to him, it has served as a “pivotal moment, prompting us to pause and truly appreciate the commitments and efforts that fuel our aspirations. These setbacks are reminders that perseverance is not just a duty but a profound journey of learning and growth”. She believes that the New Patriotic Party should hold on to the lessons gathered in the period while they are in opposition. Indicating that “May we remain steadfast and committed, trusting that when God grants us another opportunity, we will be ready—not just to participate, but to thrive.

Her position expressed in a social media post read “Exactly one year ago, we approached the polls with optimism, hopeful for a brighter future with victory. Yet, we faced an overwhelming defeat, one that weighed heavily on our spirits. In the time since, I have taken a step back to reflect on that experience. It has become clear to me that some defeats are necessary. They serve as pivotal moments, prompting us to pause and truly appreciate the commitments and efforts that fuel our aspirations. These setbacks are reminders that perseverance is not just a duty but a profound journey of learning and growth. As we look forward, let us hold onto the lessons we’ve gathered from our past experiences.

You must be corrupt to meet increasing demands of constituents  Former MP,"Former Member of Parliament for Zebilla, Cletus Avoka, has raised fresh concerns about the growing financial pressures on political leaders, arguing that money demands from constituents are a major driver of corruption within Ghana’s political system. Avoka said continuous requests for money from the public have created a system where politicians feel forced to engage in corrupt practices simply to survive politically. “Every day, Momo. Every day, MoMo. Somebody is sick in the hospital, you have to send money. Somebody is going to do a wedding, you have to send money,” he said in an interview with GHOne TV monitored by MyNewsGh. He added that even during cultural events, the demands never stop. “They are going to do adore, they are asking for you. They are asking for school fees and whatnot.” Avoka argued that these pressures contribute significantly to why some politicians lose internal primaries, not because of incompetence, but because they cannot meet the financial expectations of supporters. “Many of us lose primaries and elections, not because we are not doing good work, but because you are not giving money out.” He described the reality facing MPs who spend long hours in Parliament but are still expected to send money back home. “How do you give the money out if you come and stay there for eight hours? You are debating for five hours or eight hours and close in the evening and go to sleep the following day, you have no money to send. You have to go out and look for the money.” The reporter then interjected, “Like Mr. Babgin said, and that’s where the corruption starts.” The former MP answered in the affirmative, “Yeah, that’s where the corruption starts. If I’m not corrupt, how can I maintain my seat? You have to be corrupt in one way or the other.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Young people are losing faith  Minority Leader warns both NPP and NDC,"Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin says both major political parties must accept responsibility for growing youth disillusionment, warning that young people who powered election campaigns feel abandoned. “The big men have received their appointments. The NDC upper-middle class is being sorted out nicely,” he said. “But the young people who did the fighting have been left with the same unemployment and hopelessness.” He cautioned that treating youth as expendable campaign tools poses a serious threat to national stability. “Do we not see the danger in this? When a society tells its young people that their only value is as political foot soldiers, the consequences are dire.” Afenyo-Markin also turned scrutiny inward: “We in the NPP must engage in honest self-reflection. Our own arrogance and detachment contributed to the people’s verdict against us.” He warned that social frustration could escalate without a bipartisan shift in governance priorities. “When the people’s anger is unleashed, it will make no distinction between NPP and NDC. The youth do not care about party colours, they care about jobs and opportunity.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Democracy contains the mechanism for its own correction  Afenyo-Markin,"Alexander Afenyo-Markin has cautioned that weakening democratic institutions risks fuelling public frustration at a time when many nations are experiencing political upheaval. Referring to the global climate, he said, “From Paris to Antananarivo, young people are taking to the streets. They are impatient and weary of leaders who promise transformation but deliver partisan warfare.” He warned that Ghana is not immune to such pressures, arguing that democracy loses its appeal when elected leaders appear to abuse constitutional mandates. “Democracy remains the best form of government because it contains within itself the mechanism for its own correction,” he said. “But that mechanism only works if institutions remain independent and credible.” Afenyo-Markin condemned undemocratic takeovers across West Africa, but urged political leaders to confront the reasons citizens sometimes welcome such ruptures. “When the powerful treat the Constitution as an inconvenience, democracy loses its lustre,” he cautioned. He insisted that maintaining credible electoral and accountability institutions is crucial: “The ballot box can correct this government’s failings only if the institutions that protect free and fair elections are left intact.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

The world is not waiting for Ghana  Afenyo-Markin,"Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin says Ghana risks being left behind in the global technological transformation as other countries invest heavily in artificial intelligence, infrastructure and human-resource development. “This is the age of artificial intelligence and unprecedented innovation,” he said in a post on social media. “While your government busies itself with politics of ‘I will show you where power lies,’ other nations are making transformative investments that will determine global leadership for the next century.” He cited the United States, China, the UAE and Saudi Arabia as countries intentionally positioning themselves for dominance in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. “Farmers now use AI-powered tools, security agencies use predictive systems, and industries are being reshaped by automation,” he added. Afenyo-Markin questioned Ghana’s readiness: “Where is Ghana in this race? What investments are being made to ensure our young people can compete in the new world?” He argued that the government’s focus on political removals undermines long-term economic goals. “You cannot build a technology-driven economy when your priority is settling scores rather than building new industries,” he stressed.

Addressing the President directly, he noted, “What you achieved in December 2024 is extraordinarily rare. “A leader who lost power, spent eight years out of office, and returned through the ballot box—that feat alone should be profoundly humbling.” He argued that such a second chance should be used to drive meaningful transformation rather than actions that “history will remember as removals and arrests.” Citing past presidents, he said legacies endure when leaders focus on major national reforms, adding, “When we speak of President Kufour, we think of NHIS; for Akufo-Addo, we think of Free SHS.” Afenyo-Markin urged the President to take control of his administration; “You must not allow yourself to be led astray by those whose only agenda is retribution. The hawks are stealing your legacy.” He called for moderates within the governing party to be empowered, saying Ghana needs development-oriented leadership, not “an administration consumed by settling political scores.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Minority Leader says government is living dangerously one year after polls,"Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin has raised fresh concerns about what he describes as a growing pattern of politically motivated removals under the current administration. He argued that one year after Ghanaians voted for change, the country is instead witnessing “retribution rather than transformation.” “The purge began with thousands of citizens removed from state institutions without due process. “Then came the unprecedented removal of the Chief Justice, and now the top hierarchy of the Electoral Commission and the Office of the Special Prosecutor face the same fate,” he said in a social media post sighted by MyNewsGh. According to him, “a pattern emerges, clear as daylight,” claiming that party figures are driving an agenda that prioritises settling scores over national development. Afenyo-Markin insisted that the government’s approach “reveals its true priorities, and those priorities have nothing to do with the welfare of ordinary Ghanaians.” He questioned the status of key campaign promises, adding, “Where is the 24-Hour Economy? Where are the jobs for young people? Where is the industrial transformation?” The Minority Leader maintained that Ghanaians voted for responsible governance, not “vendetta politics dressed as renewal.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Mahama reassures nation of inclusive governance in anniversary message,"President John Dramani Mahama has marked the first anniversary of his decisive 2024 election victory with a reflective national message, expressing deep gratitude to Ghanaians and reaffirming his commitment to the Resetting Ghana agenda. Mahama was declared the winner of the 2024 presidential election on December 9, 2025, securing 6,328,397 votes, representing 56.55% of valid votes cast, to defeat Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), who garnered 4,657,304 votes (41.61%). The National Democratic Congress (NDC) also won a majority in Parliament, sealing a sweeping electoral mandate. Reflecting on the anniversary, President Mahama described December 7 as a day when the collective will of Ghanaians reshaped the nation’s course. “A year ago today, on 7 December, Ghana spoke with one powerful voice. As I reflect on that historic day, I am filled with profound gratitude and renewed determination,” he wrote. He recalled the atmosphere at polling centres across the country and the determination of millions who queued for hours to vote. “I remember the anxiety, the hope, and the unwavering faith of millions of Ghanaians who stood in those voting queues, determined to reclaim our future.” Mahama thanked citizens for believing in the NDC’s vision to Build the Ghana We Want. “Thank you, Ghanaians. You believed in the promise of a #ResettingGhana agenda. You trusted in our collective vision to ‘Build the Ghana We Want’.” He also praised the dedication of NDC supporters and grassroots operatives whose efforts underpinned the party’s electoral success. “To the rank and file of the NDC, you were the heartbeat of this victory. To our polling agents who stood guard at every polling station, you were our eyes and ears, our ‘own referees’ as I called for.” President Mahama explained the reasoning behind his call for “our own referees,” stating that the strategy was intended to ensure that the people’s voice was protected. “That clarion call to go to the polls with ‘our own referee’ was exactly what it needed to be. That was a strategy to demobilise the plans of the Electoral Commission and neutralise the ruling NPP’s calculated attempts to subvert the will of the people. Your vigilance turned the tide.” He extended appreciation to party executives, strategists, campaign teams, and election managers whose planning and coordination strengthened the NDC’s position before and during the polls. “To our party executives, our election management team, our communications team, our operations team, our strategy team, and our campaign team, ayekoo! Your pre-election strategies laid the foundation for election-day tactics that proved unshakeable. You anticipated every move, countered every scheme, and ensured that the voice of the people could not be silenced.” Mahama reaffirmed his commitment to inclusive, fair, and compassionate leadership. “Today, I renew my pledge to every Ghanaian that we are building a Ghana for ALL our people, without discrimination, without exclusion, without favouritism. The Ghana We Want is not a dream deferred but a promise in progress.” He added that he and Vice President Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang remain steadfast in delivering opportunities, restoring hope, and rebuilding trust in public institutions. “My commitment to the #ResettingGhana agenda remains steadfast, and Vice President Naana Jane and our government will work every day to create opportunities, restore hope, and rebuild trust in our institutions.” To supporters of the NDC, the President urged patience and collective resolve. “To my NDC family, hold on tight. Your reward is not just in positions or appointments, but in the Ghana we are building together… delivering a Ghana where your children will have opportunities, where justice prevails, and where hard work is rewarded.” He closed with gratitude and a call for national unity. “The journey continues. The work goes on. Thank you, Ghana. Thank you, NDC.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Kufuor Details How His Son Acquired Hotel Waa Waa from Kumasi Businessman,"Former President John Agyekum Kufour has opened up about the acquisition of Hotel De Waawaa, now African Regent Hotel. According to him, the hotel was not owned by the government but by a private businessman from Kumasi. He explained that the businessman was cash-strapped and decided to exchange it with his son for a loan. However, political detractors used that against him and wanted to knock him off with the propaganda that he had used his power and state resources to purchase the hotel. “My son owns it, and it is not for the government. They wanted to take me out of the way; that is why they told the lie that I own it. They even said I have twins with a white lady, so I asked that they bring the twins, and till today, nothing of the kind has been brought before me. There were no twins. Is it the government that built that hotel? No. The person who built the hotel is called Masaud. When you use the Spintex Road, you’ll see the RobinHood Hotel. Masaud built it. He is from Kumasi, and he built that edifice but he wanted me to handle it but I told him I am into politics and can’t do that. So I asked him to give it to my son Yaw, who was already a businessman, although he was working as the Executive Director for Price Waterhouse. He gave it to him in exchange for a loan. The records are there to speak for themselves. But for God, they would have used that to knock me off,” he told Deloris Frimpong Manso.

A Special Prosecutor cannot say he is powerless  Martin Kpebu rebukes Kissi Ayebeng,"Martin Kpebu has criticised the Special Prosecutor for what he describes as “powerlessness” in handling high-profile corruption cases. “A special prosecutor cannot say he is powerless,” Kpebu told JoyNews as monitored by MyNewsGh. “If all these institutions are not helping, the ultimate boss is the sovereign, the people of Ghana. If you hit a roadblock, you must inform them.” He argued that public engagement is key when institutional mechanisms fail. “Just as I gave press statements in the past, if Ayebeng had acted, the public would know. That is how you hold the system accountable,” he said. Kpebu also accused the SP of misleading the public regarding the timeline of investigations. “They said investigations started late in January 2025; that is false. The diary of action shows otherwise. Misstatements have undermined trust in the office,” he said. He further questioned selective actions within OSP. “Why target the head when most activities are not personally managed by him? Evidence should dictate focus. “That is my simple answer,” Kpebu said, confirming that he plans to submit a formal petition for the SP’s removal next week.

"Kissi Ayebeng is a double agent, I can prove it  Martin Kpebu charges","Martin Kpebu has alleged that the Special Prosecutor (SP) has been compromised and that certain individuals were allowed to leave Ghana due to institutional incompetence. “The SP is a double agent,” Kpebu said on Joy Prime’s Newsfile monitored by MyNewsGh. “I didn’t tie it to just one case. He is doing it for friends on the other side. I’m home and dry on this claim.” He specifically referred to the departure of Ofori-Atta, who, according to Kpebu, left Ghana while authorities failed to act. “They allowed Ofori-Atta to flee because they are so incompetent,” he said. “I would have been at the airport myself to blow the whistle if necessary.” Kpebu criticized the OSP for allegedly failing to coordinate with key institutions. “Ayebeng claimed he sought help from the NIB, immigration, and national security, but I have a letter from NIB denying he contacted them,” he said. The lawyer framed his allegations within the broader public interest, citing constitutional sovereignty. “When you hit a roadblock, the ultimate owners of the nation must know. Sovereignty resides in the people of Ghana,” he said, referencing Articles 1, 35, and 125 of the Constitution.

Its bad optics to present evidence to officers below the SP  Martin Kpebu insists,"Private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu has rejected presenting his evidence of alleged misconduct at the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) to officers he considers subordinates of the Special Prosecutor, arguing that only board-level officials can handle such matters impartially. “I am willing to cooperate because I have evidence,” Kpebu told JoyNews’ Newsfile monitored by MyNewsGh. “Each time they invite me, I go, except the one they couldn’t bring to my notice. I keep going because I have evidence.” He said prior panels, including officers who were “subordinates,” were inadequate to handle sensitive information. “When we say we need something independent, we should meet the board members,” Kpebu said. “If a subordinate finds the boss liable, people will say he has a beef. If he exonerates him, they will claim bias. It doesn’t look good.” Kpebu also noted that OSP currently lacks a functioning board, but efforts to constitute one appear to be underway. “Ask me to give information to a subordinate? No, it doesn’t look good. I can see efforts are being made to constitute a board,” he added. The lawyer stressed that his refusal is based on procedural fairness rather than obstruction. “Absolutely, there are no officers within the OSP to whom I would submit except the board members,” he said, emphasizing the importance of an independent evaluation of his evidence.

Your reward isnt in appointmentsMahama to NDC members crying over neglect,"President of Ghana, John Dramani Mahama, has urged members of his political party crying over neglect, to be steadfast. He says their reward is not just in appointments or positions but rather in the Ghana that he and the government are building. The President made this known in a post shared via social media to thank Ghanaians for voting massively for him during the 2024 elections. He said, “To my NDC family, hold on tight. Your reward is not just in positions or appointments, but in the Ghana we are building together, delivering a Ghana where your children will have opportunities, where justice prevails, and where hard work is rewarded”. John Dramani Mahama used the opportunity to reaffirm his commitment to his promise of resetting Ghana. “Today, I renew my pledge to every Ghanaian that we are building a Ghana for ALL our people, without discrimination, without exclusion, without favouritism. The Ghana We Want is not a dream deferred but a promise in progress. My commitment to the #ResettingGhana agenda remains steadfast, and Vice President Naana Jane and our government will work every day to create opportunities, restore hope, and rebuild trust in our institutions.”. Some members of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) have complained bitterly about neglect after the electoral success in 2024. They have expressed their pain through posts shared via social media because they were promised jobs and appointments, which have not seen the light of day. The latest to cry over neglect is Mzbel, who was seen actively campaigning for the NDC during the 2024 electioneering season. She says people she used to call do not pick up her calls, while those who do pick up are mean towards her.

Odike Accuses EC Chair Jean Mensa of targeting smaller political parties,"Ghanaian businessman and politician Akwasi Addae Odike has launched strong accusations against Electoral Commission (EC) Chairperson Jean Mensa, alleging that she has consistently acted with bias and hostility toward smaller political parties. Speaking in an interview on Ezra TV during discussions on the petition calling for the removal of the EC Chair monitored by MyNewsGh.com, Odike claimed that under Jean Mensa’s leadership, smaller parties have been unfairly treated in the electoral process. According to him, unlike the era of former EC Chair Dr. Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, when political parties were allowed to correct errors in their nomination documents, the current administration takes a far more punitive approach. He alleged that Jean Mensa “refuses to allow corrections,” and instead takes the documents away and later holds a press conference announcing a disqualification. “If she has any shame, she should go home quietly,” he said. Odike further claimed that some small political parties had been co-opted by the EC to support its positions during IPAC meetings, sidelining others who were not aligned with government. He added that a member of his own party who worked within the EC warned him ahead of time that there was “a strong hand” preventing him from successfully filing his nomination forms, a prediction he said eventually came true. “They have hatred for some of the smaller parties that are not aligned with government,” Odike alleged. “If she can defend that I am telling lies, she should come out and defend herself.” His comments form part of growing public scrutiny following multiple petitions submitted to President John Dramani Mahama seeking the removal of the EC Chair and her deputies. The petitions have since been forwarded to the Chief Justice for preliminary review. Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Jean Mensa should resign as EC Chair over partisanship and poor electoral conduct  Odike,"Ghanaian businessman and politician Akwasi Addae Odike has issued strong criticism of Electoral Commission (EC) Chairperson Mrs Jean Mensa, stating that she “has no shame” remaining in office despite what he describes as serious failures in her role. Speaking on Ezra TV during discussions on the petition seeking the removal of the EC Chair monitored by MyNewsGh.com, Odike argued that Ghana’s electoral leadership has become too partisan, and proposed the creation of an independent electoral college to elect future EC chairpersons. According to him, such a system would strengthen the institution’s professionalism and integrity. Odike contrasted the current leadership with the tenure of former EC Chair Dr. Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, noting that although Afari-Gyan had challenges, he maintained independence and resisted political pressure. He claimed that those who have succeeded him, including Jean Mensa, have shown clear partisan alignment that undermines Ghana’s democratic process. Citing the recent presidential election, Odike accused Jean Mensa of presenting “six different figures” while serving as returning officer, arguing that this alone should have warranted her resignation. “If she has shame, she should have resigned by now, together with her deputies and their fraudulent figures,” he said. “With such a position, you must practice the ethics that come with it.” Odike stated firmly that he fully supports the petitions calling for her removal, adding that her performance “did so badly” that she should no longer hold the office. His comments come at a time when multiple petitions have been submitted to President John Dramani Mahama, who has forwarded them to the Chief Justice in line with the constitutional processes for determining whether there is a prima facie case for removal.

NDC and floating voters now prefer Kennedy Agyapong to lead NPP  Polls,"A new social media poll shared by the Executive Director of Global InfoAnalytics, Mussah Dankwah, suggests a shift in preference among NDC voters and floating voters regarding the New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer contest. According to Dankwah, the latest online sampling points towards an increased preference for Kennedy Agyapong over former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia. Sharing the graphic on social media, Dankwah stated that “in a new twist in the NPP race, the social media poll shows the majority of NDC voters and floating voters now prefer Hon. Kennedy Agyapong than Dr Bawumia, contrary to previous polling data.” He explained that “the poll shows KOA attracts 39% of NDC voters’ support compared with 33% for DMB, KAA is in third place with 14%.” Among floating voters, Dankwah added that Kennedy Agyapong again leads with 38%, followed by Dr Bawumia at 32%, with former Trades Minister Kwadwo Alan Kyerematen recording 15%. According to him, it remains unclear whether these online trends will match more traditional polling channels. Dankwah stated that “it is yet to be confirmed if this new twist will be reflected in the telephone and face-to-face edition of the national tracking pol,l which starts next week.” He urged political actors to rely on research rather than assumptions, noting that “no two elections are the same, folks. Strategic communication works better with data. Don’t fly blind.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

NPP voters prefer Haruna Iddrisu as flagbearer- Report,"A new social media poll released by Global InfoAnalytics has revealed contrasting preferences between NPP voters and floating voters in the ongoing conversation about potential NDC leadership. The data shared by pollster and Executive Director, Mussah Dankwah, suggests that Haruna Iddrisu enjoys remarkable backing among NPP supporters, while floating voters appear split at the top. According to Dankwah, “In the NDC race, NPP voters prefer Haruna Iddrisu with a whopping 42% support, followed by Asiedu Nketia with 16%, Prof. Opoku-Agyemang, 13%, Julius Debrah, 12%, Ato Forson, 7%, Joshua Alabi, 4%, Okudjeto Ablakwa, 3% and Eric Opoku, 2%.” However, results among floating voters paint a slightly different picture, with Ato Forson and Haruna Iddrisu both commanding 27%. Dankwah noted that “among floating voters, Ato Forson holds a thin razor lead over Haruna but statistically tied on 27% each, matching the outcome of the NDC voters.” In that group, Asiedu Nketia follows with 18%, while Prof. Opoku-Agyemang records 10%. Julius Debrah and Okudjeto Ablakwa are reported as tied at 7%, with Joshua Alabi at 2% and Eric Opoku at 1%.

Manasseh Azure questions OSP investigative procedures and evidence handling,"Manasseh Azure Awuni has also questioned the procedural integrity of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), pointing to anomalies in the handling of investigations. Speaking on Newsfile, he revealed that OSP officials contacted him on January 29, 2025, regarding a petition he filed to investigate SML. “Officials of that office reached out to me on the 29th of January 2025 and the call was the fact that; you petition our office to begin investigating SML, we are about to start the investigation and we think it is proper that we understand the petition,” Awuni said. Awuni also pointed out that key figures targeted in the investigation were not involved in the evidence presented. “When I saw the nature of the evidence… none of the people who were major targets in the investigation was involved,” he stated. He referenced the OSP’s diary of actions, showing how investigations were recorded. “The first entry on that diary of action… was entered on the 29th of January 2025 at 12:40 p.m. This diary from the OSP shows that the persons of interest are identified at the preliminary stages of the investigation,” Awuni explained. These observations, combined with inconsistencies in the office’s claims about the SML contract savings, have contributed to public doubts. Awuni emphasized, “If an office of this nature is coming up with information, it is difficult at this moment to just believe everything that they say.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Discrepancies in SML figures raise doubts about OSP  Awuni,"Investigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has expressed serious doubts about the credibility of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), citing inconsistencies in the office’s claims regarding the SML contract. Speaking on Newsfile on JoyNews, Awuni said, “It is difficult to believe this office… it is difficult at this moment to just believe everything that they say.” Awuni highlighted discrepancies in figures released by the OSP, particularly concerning claims by Sammy Darko that the office had saved $2.7 billion (GH₵30 billion) that would have been paid to SML. According to Awuni, “I spoke to the Special Prosecutor himself, Kissi Agyaben… and I told him that the entire contract sum for the SML, the five-year contract, was $500 million, a little over $500 million. So where did you get this $2.7 billion from?” He further noted that documents he reviewed, including a Public Procurement Authority (PPA) letter, did not support the $2.7 billion figure. “In my investigation, I had a PPA letter, and the letter did not in any place state the $2.7 billion that Kissi Agyaben claimed. “If you go to the OSP’s website now, they have come back to the same figure, the $500 million that I mentioned earlier.” Awuni concluded that such contradictions justify public skepticism about the office. “If an office of this nature is coming up with information, it is difficult at this moment to just believe everything that they say,” he said.

Im still traumatised by my arrest  Martin Kpebu,"Private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu has recounted what he describes as abusive treatment by personnel of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) during his recent arrest, saying the experience has left him unsettled. Speaking on Newsfile on Saturday, he said he is “still a bit traumatised” by the conduct of the officials involved. Kpebu stated that “the manner in which they spoke to me and handled the situation was completely unacceptable,” insisting that the officers acted in a way that violated his rights and dignity. According to him, the arrest was sudden and unnecessarily aggressive. “It happened so suddenly, and the treatment was harsh. I felt violated as a citizen who has always respected the law. “I never abused anyone; in fact, it was their conduct that amounted to abuse. If this can happen to me, a lawyer, then ordinary citizens are even more vulnerable,” he said. His account contributes to ongoing public conversations about the OSP’s handling of arrests and its broader operational culture, with Kpebu emphasising that the experience highlights the need for reforms in law enforcement procedures.

"I criticised Rawlings, Mahama and everyone else, I tell the truth  KSM","Media personality and satirist Kwaku Sintim-Misa (KSM) has rejected claims that he aligns with any political administration, saying his record shows consistent criticism across governments during KSM UNFILTERED. He recalled his early days on the radio during the Rawlings era. “I would give it to Rawlings left, right and centre,” he said on the show monitored by MyNewsGh. “That’s how I do things, tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may.” According to him, his approach earned both backlash and unexpected respect. He narrated how Rawlings once invited him to join a panel during investigations into a controversial comment the former president made about women’s killings. “JJ said he wanted me there because he thought I was very objective,” he recounted. “I was honoured.” KSM also described how he tested the boundaries of political satire during live performances. He recalled performing with Rawlings seated in the front row; “I threw a jab and he laughed. I gave an uppercut, and he laughed. That’s when I knew I could go all the way.” He contrasted that era with today’s environment, where he believes political supporters are more intolerant. “Sometimes people get angry for no reason. Others see jokes and simply laugh because they are jokes,” he said. KSM stressed that his critique is rooted in objectivity, not partisanship. “What you see as bashing is based on the perspective you have. I’ve always been consistent.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Friendship with Mahama doesnt influence my work  Bridget Otoo,"Bridget Otoo has dismissed claims that her professional views are shaped by her long-standing friendship with President John Dramani Mahama. Appearing on KSM UNFILTERED, she said the assumption that she aligns with the NDC because of that relationship is inaccurate. Responding to public perceptions, she stated, “People tag you as favouring him or the NDC. It goes way back, but it’s not because of any personal relationship.” She clarified that although she has known Mahama for years, it is not a relationship that influences her journalism or commentary. When asked if she calls the president when issues arise, she answered directly: “No. I may send a text, long ago I would send an email, but I’ve never called him to discuss anything.” She also noted that she does not engage Mahama socially. “It’s not friends-friends like ‘when are we hanging out?’ No, not at all,” she said. Bridget Otoo emphasised that criticism of government is part of her work and has never been hindered by personal connections.

How Mahama predicted NPPs defeat long before election  KSM shares,"KSM has revisited his pre-election prediction about the political climate, arguing that the electoral outcome reflected widespread dissatisfaction rather than party entitlements. Speaking on KSM UNFILTERED as monitored by MyNewsGh, he said he initially thought the governing party (the New Patriotic Party -NPP) at that time would “break the eight” based on the confidence of its campaign machinery. According to him, his perception changed only months before the elections when deeper public sentiments became clearer. “I could listen, I could read, I could see, and I could read beyond the façade,” he explained. “If you didn’t pay attention to the quiet rumbling, you’d think they were going to win.” KSM referenced an interview he conducted with John Dramani Mahama while he was still in opposition. “I asked him, ‘What if they break the eight?’ and he said, ‘They’ll break the eight all right, eight years of corruption, eight years of arrogance, eight years of impunity.’” He added that Ghana’s political culture often assumes that every government is “entitled” to eight years, a mentality he believes must be reassessed. “There’ll be a breaking of the eight, but it will be eight years of corruption that Ghanaians will break,” he insisted.

Eastern Region NPP Executives pledge full support for Bawumia  campaign team confirms,"Deputy Spokesperson for Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia’s campaign, Dr. Ekua Amoakoh, says the Eastern Region has overwhelmingly pledged its support for the Vice President’s presidential bid, citing his long-standing loyalty to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and his vision for the country. According to her, the team had initially expected divided support in the region because one of the competing flagbearer aspirants hails from there. However, their tour of the constituencies revealed the opposite. “We thought that because one of the candidates was from the Eastern Region, we might face challenges securing support for Dr. Bawumia. But we were completely surprised,” she said. “The regional executives told us that Dr. Bawumia’s loyalty and support to former President Akufo-Addo throughout his tenure must now be reciprocated. They have decided to support him wholeheartedly.” Dr. Amoakoh added that stakeholders in the region pointed to Dr. Bawumia’s vision, humility, and track record as reasons they believe he should lead the party into the next presidential election. “All the constituencies we visited pledged their support, the Council of Elders, patrons, chairpersons, Members of Parliament, and electoral area coordinators,” she said. In Akuapem North alone, about 30 electoral area coordinators reportedly signed documents affirming their commitment to vote for Dr. Bawumia. Dr. Amoakoh noted that her team was the third campaign delegation to tour the region, yet party members waited specifically to declare their allegiance to Dr. Bawumia, a gesture she described as both significant and encouraging. “This shows that they truly mean what they told us, and it makes us very happy. We are assuring them that we will not disappoint,” she added.  Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Bantama NPP Chairman declares support for Bawumia,"The Bantama Constituency Chairman of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Mr. Fiifi Mensah, has openly declared his support for former Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia in the party’s upcoming flagbearer election. Speaking in an interview on Kumasi-based Angel Fm monitored by MyNewsGh.com, Mr. Mensah said he has already made his position clear to party members in his constituency, stressing that his choice does not translate into hostility towards other aspirants. “In my constituency, I have told everyone that if we truly want the betterment of the party, we must work together,” he said. “In elections, you cannot intimidate anyone. The decision ultimately lies between the voter and the ballot paper.” Mr. Mensah explained that although constituency and regional executives may have individual preferences, all aspirants would be given equal opportunity to campaign in Bantama. “All the chairpersons know who they are supporting, but on 31st December we will all find out who wins the flagbearer race, and once the winner emerges, we will rally behind that person,” he stated. He emphasised that his endorsement of Dr. Bawumia does not mean he will undermine or speak against other contenders. “My support for Dr. Bawumia does not give me the right to hinder anyone’s campaign. We allow every candidate who comes to Bantama to engage delegates freely,” he added. “I am not a pretender. My party members in Bantama know exactly where I stand.” Chairman Mensah urged party faithful to respect differing views within the party, adding that unity after the election is non-negotiable. “Having divergent views does not mean we should fight each other. At the end of the day, whoever wins becomes the candidate we will all support for the 2028 presidential election,” he said.

I wouldve been a perfect fit for the special prosecutor jobMartin Kpebu,"Private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu believes he is a perfect fit for the Office of the Special Prosecutor. Although he does not have any interest in becoming the Special Prosecutor, he would have executed the role with alacrity if he were given the position. However, by principle, he will not accept any offer to become the Special Prosecutor after he has succeeded in booting Kissi Agyebang out of office. The private legal practitioner was speaking to Accra-based Asempa FM when he made this known. “But for my advocacy for the OSP to be removed, it will not make sense for me to take such a position because it will look like my advocacy was just to get him out so that the position will be given to me, but that is not the case,” he said. When asked if he would have considered the position if not for his advocacy against the current occupant, he said, “If the president thought so and Ghanaians agreed, why not?” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

What exactly did Martin Kpebu obstruct?   Manasseh Azure questions OSP,"Investigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has raised questions about the legal basis of the arrest of private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP). Speaking on the impasse, Awuni questioned what specific work Kpebu obstructed, noting discrepancies in the OSP’s narrative. “From the OSP’s narration, Martin Kpebu did not insist on conducting the interview in the compound of the OSP. He walked out of the compound to meet the reporters. The security men asked him and the journalists to move away. He did not argue with them. He obliged,” Awuni noted in a post on social media. He further highlighted that the journalists reportedly wanted to protest, but Kpebu instructed them to comply. “(The Joy FM reporter present said the journalists wanted to protest, but Martin Kpebu asked them to comply and move away.) This narration says they moved as far as the yam seller’s spot to conduct the interview. After the interview with the journalists, Martin Kpebu entered the premises of the OSP alone,” he explained. Awuni questioned the justification for the arrest, pointing out that the confrontation that followed involved a security guard and verbal exchanges, rather than interference with an ongoing investigation. “Martin Kpebu is arrested for obstruction, and his lawyers said the bail condition included a landed property registered in his name. So, what work of the OSP did he obstruct: the investigation he came there to assist or the security guard’s confrontation with him about his interview outside the OSP?” He also raised legal and constitutional concerns regarding Kpebu’s right to speak to journalists outside the OSP premises. “Is there a law against speaking to journalists outside the premises of the OSP, whose wall shares a boundary with a road? Does Martin Kpebu have the right to speak to journalists outside the compound of the OSP, a right which should not be obstructed by the security men?” Awuni asked.

We are not tools for oppression  Kofi Bentil criticises OSP over Martin Kpebu case,"IMANI Africa’s Senior Vice President, Kofi Bentil, has criticised the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) for what he describes as legally questionable conduct in its handling of matters involving private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu. Speaking on Joy FM’s Midday News on Thursday, he argued that the OSP must operate within clear legal boundaries and remain open to public scrutiny. “We make laws for ourselves. We don’t make laws to establish tools for people to oppress us. The OSP must appreciate that it is a public office and is subject to criticism. “They are not above the law. Anything they do must be properly grounded in the law. I don’t think what is going on is right,” Bentil stated. His comments come against the backdrop of a long-running dispute between Kpebu and the OSP. The tension stems from Kpebu’s persistent public criticism of the office’s operations, leadership and decision-making under Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng. He has repeatedly accused the OSP of abusing its powers, overreaching its mandate, and failing to tackle high-level corruption effectively. The OSP has, in turn, dismissed many of his remarks as misleading, defending its actions as lawful and necessary. The confrontation escalated on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, when Kpebu was arrested and detained after reporting to the OSP headquarters upon invitation. He had appeared in relation to corruption allegations he himself had filed against the Special Prosecutor. The OSP later stated that the arrest was based on alleged obstruction, claiming Kpebu “insulted security officers” and hindered them from carrying out their lawful duties. Bentil argued that Kpebu’s decision to cooperate with the OSP does not diminish his legal rights. “Martin is trying to be as law-abiding as possible. It is possible that, given what is going on, he can refuse to cooperate with the OSP because he has no responsibility to do so,” he said. He added that the OSP must demonstrate that its actions meet strict legal standards. “They don’t have plenary powers to do whatever they want, however they want. So they should clarify what they are doing and ensure it is rooted in clear legal authority,” Bentil stressed.

Rawlings looks contributed to his electoral victory in 1996 electionsKufour recalls,"Former President of Ghana John Agyekum Kufour has shared some of the defining moments in his contest against Jerry John Rawlings in 1996. According to him, apart from the fact that Rawlings was superhuman and had control over everything, the women also said he was the handsome one in the contest. Kufour said even his political party did not have any form of belief in him, so they refused to sponsor his campaign. “How can you even campaign against Rawlings at that time? He had all the incumbency advantage. Even in some of the places, they said he was the handsome one. They said he is the son of a whiteman,” he recalled in an interview with Deloris Frimpong Manso. Kufour indicated that although Rawlings won the election, it took the Electoral Commission five days to declare the results, indicating how competitive the election was that year.

I sponsored my first election against Rawlings because NPP doubted my chancesKufour,"Former President of Ghana, John Agyekum Kufour has said that the New Patriotic Party (NPP) did not believe in his chances against Jerry John Rawlings the first time he contested him. According to him, the party did not contribute a penny to his campaign during the period. He made this known when he spoke to Deloris Frimpong Manso in a yet-to-be-released interview. “My party didn’t even believe I had any chance. They did not even give me a bicycle for the campaign. I footed the bills for my campaign. He owned the country, and even the women said he was the handsome one. Kufour said his party’s fears did not deter him from contesting the election, and with the help of a few friends, he campaigned throughout the country. “I put a team together, and with a few pickups, we campaigned. On the day of the elections, the EC Chairperson said he needed protection to announce the results,” he recalled.
