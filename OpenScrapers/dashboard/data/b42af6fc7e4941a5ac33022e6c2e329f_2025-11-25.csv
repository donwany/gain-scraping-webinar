Major events in parliament that shocked Ghanaians in 2023,"In the hallowed chambers of Ghana's Parliament, where the echoes of democracy reverberates through impassioned debates and the clash of opposing ideologies, each sitting unfolds as a dramatic spectacle, leaving an indelible imprint on the nation's collective consciousness.
Like a theatrical performance on the grand stage of governance, the majority and minority dance in the intricate choreography of political discourse, while the Speaker of Parliament literally orchestrates the symphony of democracy.
Yet, it is within these walls that major events unfurl like scenes from a riveting drama, scripted by the hands of controversy and fate, captivating Ghanaians in fervent conversations that transcend the boundaries of the parliamentary arena.
As the curtains rise with each session, the spotlight shines on the unfolding saga of government affairs, turning the legislative stage into a theatre of national dialogue and discourse.
GhanaWeb's parliamentary correspondent, Nimatu Yakubu Atouyese lists some of the major events in the House during the last sitting (in the year in review) which got Ghanaians talking.
Major shakeup in Minority leader
Barely two weeks before the house resumed sitting in 2023, the NDC leadership made some major changes in the leadership of the Minority in parliament.
The party appointed the former Deputy Minister of Finance, Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson, as the Minority Leader of the 8th Parliament of Ghanas Fourth Republic. He replaced the MP for Tamale South, Haruna Iddrisu, who had served in the position for over 6 years.
Kofi Armah Buah, MP for Ellembele, also took over as the Deputy Minority Leader, while Governs Kwame Agbodza, MP for Adaklu, replaced Asawase MP Muntaka Mohammed as the Minority Chief Whip.
Ahmed Ibrahim, MP for Banda, was maintained as the First Deputy Minority Whip, while Comfort Doyoe Cudjoe-Ghansah, MP for Ada, became the Second Deputy Minority Whip.
This was contained in a letter to the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, from the National Democratic Congress, dated January 23, 2023.
This steered some controversies even among the Minority caucus, with claims that they were not informed prior to the partys leadership making this decision.
The party has since reconciled the differences and is working well with its members in parliament.
Minority clashes with Majority for trying to 'smuggle' new CI into business statement
There was a clash between the Majority and Minority in parliament on February 10 with regards to the draft of a new Public Elections (Registration of Voters) Regulations, 2023.
On Friday, February 10, 2023, after the Deputy Majority Leader, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, read the business statement for the following week, the Minority Leader, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, raised concerns that the agenda that was discussed did not include Public Elections (Registration of Voters) Regulations, 2023.
... Mr Speaker at the meeting, I have a copy of the draft of the agenda we discussed. But to my surprise, I have seen an introduction of the C1 which was never discussed at the business committee meeting. But the deputy majority leader who did not attend business committee meeting stood here and made a pronouncement that this was agreed upon. Mr Speaker I am deeply disappointed in the Clerks for allowing this to be smuggled into a business statement. This can never be allowed.
Mr Speaker if that is the way this administration of the house, Mr Speaker this side of the house is ready for them, Ato Forson said.
The Public Elections (registration of Voters) Regulations, 2023 was captioned in page 4 (iii)(e) of the presentation of papers.
The Deputy Minority Chief Whip, Ahmed Banda, who described the business statement as a smuggled report, said the House will not entertain it in the chamber.
Banda added that the Deputy Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh Dompreh, had indicated they would smuggle the CI in the business statement and he truly did.
He added that there was a directive that the EC chairperson should appear before the House and brief them on the CI, which includes the rationale behind the CI.
Ahmed Banda said the EC chairperson did not appear before the House and yet the issue had still been brought into the business statement.
In response, Alexander Afenyo-Markin said that the report should not be rejected if the Minority merely disagreed, but that it should be put on hold.
Sometimes when your brother disagrees with you and you believe in a solution, you could grant us a temporal leave. Today is Friday. I will want to yield to the views expressed that we place the issue of the CI on ice for now. In other words, it wont be part of the report, Afenyo-Markin added.
The Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Joseph Osei Owusu, in his ruling, said the Majority did not deny that the CI was not part of the business arranged for the week.
So, what has not been agreed should be excluded and if you discuss and you agree. The leader can make another statement on what was agreed.  So, let's exclude what was not part of the business arrangement of the week and proceed with what has been arranged for the week, Joe Wise said.
Brouhaha over approval of ministerial nominees
Following the appointment of new ministers by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, the Minority Caucus in Parliament bragged about its position not to approve any of the ministerial nominees despite participating in the vetting process.
The Minority stated that they would not approve any of the nominees appointed by President Nana Akufo-Addo to fill some vacant positions in the government.
The decision followed a directive by the General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Fifi Kwetey, for Minority members on the Appointments Committee to reject all the nominees to prevent a large size government.
Based on the rejection from the committee, the House was to decide the plenary via secret votes.
Shockingly, after the secret vote, all the nominees were approved despite the absence of three MPs from the Majority side, including Sarah Adwoa Safo.
The party is yet to come to terms with this development.
Death of Kumawu MP
Ghanaians woke up to the sad and shocking news of the death of the Member of Parliament for Kumawu in the Ashanti Region, Philip Atta Basoah.
The three-time MP was reported to have died at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital on Tuesday morning March 28.
He died at the age of 53.
He was one of the absentee MPs in parliament when the House voted on the approval of six ministerial nominees and two justices of the Supreme Court of Ghana.
He was a member of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP).
NPP MP rushed to the hospital after being involved in an accident
Nanton MP, Mohammed Hardi Tufeiru, was involved in an accident on March 31 at a crucial time when the House was considering three tax bills
The MP, who is also the Deputy Minister for Food and Agriculture, said that he was almost at parliament when the accident occurred, as he was driving at top speed and lost control of his vehicle.
He narrated that he left parliament to see his daughter, who was admitted to the International Maritime Hospital because he could no longer get in touch with his wife, who was with her at the hospital.
At the hospital, he received calls from the leadership of the Majority Caucus, where he was told that he was needed in the House because the Minority Caucus was asking for a headcount for the approval of the taxes the government was introducing.
He told them that he had to come to parliament from the accident scene in an Uber, and was heading to the chamber to vote when some colleagues saw the state in which he was and subsequently took him to a washroom for medical attention.
Among others, he was injected, before an incision was made at the top right side of his eye where he sustained a deep cut. In the midst of all this, he restated his desire to be in the chamber to vote on the three bills.
You may not understand what was happening and I am sure you are also mindful of the important bills that we needed to pass... honestly speaking, I dont know how you are going to feel about it or whoever is going to feel about it.
I was for Ghana, I was for my party, my government and I needed to do whatever to get the bill passed, he told Eyewitness News host, Umaru Sanda Amadu on April 3.
When the host asked: Did you feel that your life was less important than the bill? the MP responded: Yes, yes... if you want you can take it like that. I am fine.
The one battle the Minority won in parliament under new leadership
The Minority, for the first time, won a battle in parliament despite having 135 members in the House, due to the Supreme Court ruling on James Gyakye Quayson, which prevented him from holding himself as an MP.
This came after the Minority could unanimously reject the draft bill of new Public Elections (Registration of Voters) Regulations, 2023.
The controversial Constitutional Instrument (CI) from the Electoral Commission (EC) was seeking to make the Ghana Card the only identification document to be used for voter registration.
From the time the CI was brought before parliament, the Minority vowed to resist its passage into law.
Following the appearance of the EC Chairperson, Jean Mensa, the Minority said that the EC needed to amend the CI in the interest of all.
The Minority also wanted the EC to reintroduce the guarantor system to the voter registration processes and decentralize it.
Based on this, the First Deputy Speaker, Joseph Osei Owusu, in presenting the report of the committee on the whole process on behalf of the Speaker, on March 31, said the committee concluded that it would not accept and would reject any effort that is geared towards making the EC use the Ghana Card as the ONLY medium to qualify a person who is eligible to vote in 2024 elections.
He added that this is premised on the fact that indeed Ghana has come of age and can boast of a credible national identification card (Ghana Card) to transact business with.
However, even in the face of several identification options given in the past, and even in the operation of the NIA, some citizens have been unable to register for the national card, due to the existence of serious challenges the Authority is confronted with.
It is clear that unless and until the challenges confronting the issuance of the Ghana Card are dealt with, using the Ghana Card as the only medium of voter registration, would negatively impact the electoral roll and thereby deny some otherwise qualified persons from registering to vote.
The House was informed to officially communicate to the EC of this decision for favourable consideration before finalization and presentation to parliament for passage into law.
This is a victory for the Minority as they successfully rejected the CI as they initially stated.
Majority in Parliament walk out ahead of budget approval
Members of the Majority Caucus in Parliament staged a walkout of the Chamber, disrupting the approval process for the Budget Statement and Economic Policy of the government for the year ending December 31, 2024.
The walkout occurred after the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, put the motion on a voice vote and declared the ""Ayes"" by the Majority as having carried the motion.
However, the Speaker's ruling was challenged by the Minority Caucus, who argued that there was no clear distinction between the ""Ayes"" and the ""Nays"" during the voice vote.
Invoking Order 113(2), the Deputy Minority Leader, Emmanuel Kofi Armah-Buah, called for a headcount or division to determine the outcome of the vote. The Speaker, adhering to the Minority's request, instructed the Clerks at the Table to conduct the headcount.
Speaker Bagbin informed the House that each MP's name would be called out for them to stand up and be counted.
However, the Majority Caucus strongly objected to the Speaker's decision, maintaining that he had already declared the ""Ayes"" in favour of the motion and should stand by his ruling.
Fearing a potential defeat or the loss of the motion, given the absence of three Majority MPs, the Majority Caucus informed the Speaker that they would not participate in the voting process and consequently walked out of the Chamber amidst booing from Minority MPs.
The walkout followed the conclusion of the one-week debate, with the Majority and Minority Leaders wrapping up their respective positions, and a presentation by the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori Atta, who urged the House to approve the motion.
Minority blocks laying of LI on restriction on importation of 22 items
The laying of the Import and Export (Restrictions on Importation of Selected Strategic Products) Regulations, 2023, hit a snag following opposition by the Minority to the Instrument in its current form.
On four occasions, the Minority blocked the laying of the LI which sought to abolish the importation of 22 items, including sugar, rice, fruit juice, margarine and other products the government considers strategic.
The Minority said it was not against the restrictions on importations but same must be done with tact by ensuring that the country had enough production capacity to make up for the demand, arguing that the necessary consultations had not been done to inculcate the views of stakeholders into the draft Instrument before it was laid.
However, on December 8, the government declared the suspension of the bill, thereby putting a stop to its planned passage.

A chronicle of two disturbing incidents of military brutalities in 2023,"There have been echoes of military brutalities that have resounded with disturbing frequencies, casting a shadow on the nation's commitment to justice and human rights in the year in review.
Two notable incidents in 2023 have left scars on the nation, prompting urgent calls for accountability and intervention.
As the nation grapples with the aftermath, the stories of Ashaiman and Garu unfold as stark reminders of the challenges in balancing security measures with safeguarding citizens' rights.
Here is a flashback on those two major incidences:
Ashaiman military brutalities:
On the morning of March 7, 2023, Ashaiman bore witness to the intrusion of military personnel on a quest for justice.
Seeking retribution for the alleged lynching of their comrade, Sherrif Imoro, just days prior, the soldiers embarked on a search that descended into chaos.
Viral videos captured the brutalities inflicted upon residents, leaving nearly 200 detained individuals to endure further suffering during interrogations at Burma Camp.
The incident not only exposed the excesses of the military but also ignited a national conversation on the thin line between justice and unchecked force.
Soldiers invade Garu, beat scores of residents to pulp
October 29 witnessed another dark episode when military personnel conducted a dawn raid at Garu, purportedly responding to an attack on some national security operatives.
What ensued, however, was a brutal assault on local residents, an act vehemently defended by the Ghana Armed Forces.
The Ministry of National Security dismissed residents' claims, asserting that the operation aimed to seize weapons following an earlier vigilante group attack.
Amidst growing concerns, the Member of Parliament for the area, Albert Alalzuuga Akuka, demanded answers regarding the fate of those apprehended, labeling the incident an egregious violation of citizens' rights.
Albert Kan Dapaah, the Minister of National Security, addressed the legislative body on November 13, condemning the Garu attack and emphasizing the need for legal recourse.
The clash between irate youth and security forces underscores the delicate balance required in maintaining order, raising questions that demand urgent answers.
In a year marred by these distressing events, Ghanaians find themselves at crossroads, grappling with the fundamental question of how to ensure security without compromising the very rights that define a democratic society.

2022 in Review: Man of the year,"Politically, this would perhaps be the first time that a Minister of Finance of Ghana has courted so much public and political attention. So much that his place as the Man of the Year is not even debated.
Ken Ofori-Atta has had what many would describe as the most vilifying year for him as a person in general, and then as the countrys chief financial officer.
From economic indicators in nearly all sectors crumbling so fast from the start of the year, to members of his own political party  the New Patriotic Party (NPP), moving the motion for him to be sacked from office for poor performance, and then the vote of censure motion moved by Minority Members of Parliament in Ghanas parliament, the man has surely earned the coveted tag.
In this review article, GhanaWeb takes a look back at all the major things that have happened in the year that sum up to Ken Ofori-Atta being adjudged as the Man of the Year 2022.
Before that, however, below are some of the achievements that have been chalked under the tenure of the minister.
Worst exchange rate against foreign currencies:
GhanaWeb's daily reports on the cedi's performance showed that on Wednesday, October 12, 2022, the cedi was trading against the dollar at a buying price of 9.7176 and a selling price of 9.7274.
This is compared to trading on Tuesday, October 11, 2022, with a recorded buying price of 9.6427 and a selling price of 9.6523.
Today, at a forex bureau in Accra, the cedi is currently trading at a buying price of 10.7807 and a selling price of 10.50 and trading at a selling price of 11.80 against the dollar.
The Pound Sterling is at a buying price of 9.9992, while it sells at a price of 10.0109.
Debt to GDP:
The country's current Debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) hit an all-time high, at GH402.4 billion as of July 2022.
The debt stock, which stood at GH392.1 billion in March 2022, dropped to GH388.1 billion in April 2022 and later went up marginally to GH389.2 billion in May 2022 and to GH393.4 billion in June 2022.
In early October 2022, Ghana was classified as a high-debt distressed country by the World Bank.
The Bank's October 2022 Africa Pulse Report said that Ghana's rising debt-to-GDP was projected to reach 104 percent by the end of this year.
This would represent an increase from 76.6 percent a year earlier, with the report attributing the development to the depreciation of the cedi, widening government deficit and rising debt service costs.
It further attributed Ghana losing its access to international capital markets as another contributing factor.
""Debt is expected to jump in Ghana to 104.6% of GDP, from 76.6% a year earlier amid a widened government deficit, massive weakening of the cedi, and rising debt service costs,"" the report noted.
Inflation hits 33.9%, highest in 21 years:
In August 2022, GhanaWeb reported that Ghana's consumer price inflation had hit a 21-year record high of 33.9%, according to the Ghana Statistical Service.
This meant that prices of goods and services went up by 2.2% between July and August 2022.
July's inflation stood at 31.7%. Government statistician Samuel Kobina Annim, who announced the rate on September 14, 2022, said for the first time in 2022, month-on-month inflation was 1.9%, the lowest this year.
Food prices:
Multiple reports have shown that in the history of Ghana's fourth republic, the rates at which food prices have been increasing in recent years have been nothing as have been experienced before.
For instance, food vendors now sell one egg at GH2.50p compared to GH1 in 2021. The raw eggs on the shelves of provision shops are also being sold between GH2 and GH1.50p for one, whereas they were sold at 70 pesewas and 80 pesewas depending on size.
The same situation has affected the prices of rice.
A 5-kilogram bag of rice now sells at almost GH100 and more, GhanaWeb's checks have revealed. The alarming rate of the increase has been attributed to the increase in fuel prices and the rippling effects on transport fares.
During a market survey by GhanaWeb on August 15, 2022, Ama Amoabea, a seller of grains, including rice, beans, and other products at the Lapaz Newmarket, said the price of rice had increased from GH300cedis for 25kg, translating to GH60 for each 5kg bag.
""The foreign ones too are becoming expensive, it was 300 cedis at first, but it is 350 cedis and 400 cedis currently. They told us that since transportation fares have been increased, the prices of everything have increased as well, so they should reduce transportation so that we can also reduce the prices,"" she said.
Fuel prices:
At the fuel pumps in 2022, Ghanaians are having to pay more than they have ever paid before. The prices of petroleum products have been soaring since the start of 2022, with petrol currently selling at GH13 per litre, while Diesel is selling at GH16 per litre across various pumps in the country.
It must be noted that in 2021, fuel prices at the pumps were at GH5, with the start of 2022 seeing the prices jump to GH6.
Public transport fares were also affected by this, with all other forms of products and food items eventually being affected.
Now, lets take a look at other major happenings in the year 2022 that have contributed to Ken Ofori-Atta being adjudged as the Man of the Year.
NPP MPs demand sack of finance minister:
In October 2022, a group of New Patriotic Party (NPP) Members of Parliament petitioned President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to sack the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, and the Minister of State at the finance ministry, Charles Adu Boahen, to restore public confidence in the economy.
Their spokesperson, Andy Kwame Appiah-Kubi, the MP for Asante-Akim North, said on Tuesday, October 25, 2022, that it will not do business with the government nor support the 2023 budget if the president fails to heed their calls.
According to them, the move follows previous concerns sent to the government that had not yielded any positive results.
""We have had occasions to defend allegations of conflicts of interest, lack of confidence, and trust against the leadership of the finance ministry.
The recent development within the economy is of major concern to our caucus and our constituents. We have made our grave concern to our president through the parliamentary leadership and the leadership of the party without and positive response, Andy Appiah Kubi said.
The MPs believed the move will change the current economic situation in the country.
The MPs were however compelled to relax their stance after the president held a meeting with them, urging them to allow the minister complete an IMF deal, as well as for him to present the 2023 budget to parliament.
Vote of censure:
The Minority Leader in Parliament, Haruna Iddrisu, and the Ranking Member on the Finance Committee of Parliament, Cassiel Ato Forson, led a motion for the removal of Ken Ofori-Atta as the Minister of Finance.
Listing their reasons for the vote of censure, the Minority outlined some seven points as follows:
a. Despicable conflict of interest ensuring that he directly benefits from Ghanas economic woes as his companies receive commissions and other unethical contractual advantages, particularly from Ghanas debt overhang
b. Unconstitutional withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund in blatant contravention of Article 178 of the 1992 Constitution, supposedly for the construction of the Presidents Cathedral.
c. Illegal payment of oil revenues into offshore accounts, in flagrant violation of Article 176 of the 1992 Constitution.
d. Deliberate and dishonest misreporting of economic data to Parliament
e. Fiscal recklessness leading to the crash of the Ghana Cedi which is currently the worst-performing currency in the world
f. Alarming incompetence and frightening ineptitude, resulting in the collapse of the Ghanaian economy and an excruciating cost of living crisis
g. Gross mismanagement of the Ghanaian economy which has occasioned untold and unprecedented hardship
The motion was eventually referred to an ad hoc committee set up by the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, and co-chaired by the Members of Parliament for Adansi-Asokwa and Bolgatanga East, K.T. Hammond and Dominic Ayine, respectively.
After a number of sittings spanning a period of 7 days, the 8-member ad hoc committee presented its findings to the Speaker of Parliament.
After delivering the findings to the House, Alban Bagbin called for a motion to be moved for a vote to be taken on the findings, following which all the Members of Parliament on the Majority side staged a walkout, including the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, and the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General, Godfred Dame, who were also in parliament.
The motion failed as the votes in favour of it were less than the two-thirds of the House (183 votes) needed for it to be passed.
Only 136 National Democratic Congress Members of Parliament who were present in the House voted in favour of the motion as their colleague MPs from the Majority caucus were absent.
Delivering the verdict of the motion, the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, said This House, hereby resolves as follows to pass a vote of censure on the minister responsible for finance.
Those in favour after the secret vote is 136. Does against 0. Attentions 0.
Now in accordance with Article 82 (1) which reads Parliament may by a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of all the Members of Parliament pass a vote of censure on a minister of state, he said
He added that: Following the terms of vote of censure by Article 82(1) the vote is accordingly lost.
While it appears as if the minister has been left off the hook for now, not all the MPs from his party have completely backed down on their calls for him to be sacked.
Nonetheless, Ken Ofori-Atta continue to remain at post, with President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo giving indications many times that he is not ready to sack the minister, and once describing his performance as exceptional.
Whatever the case is, the Minister of Finance cannot run away from the tag of the most popular politician of 2022, easily making him GhanaWebs Man of the Year in retrospect.

Most devastating floods that caused the biggest havoc in 2022,"Its one of Ghanas biggest problems  annual flooding, particularly in many parts of the capital; Accra.
Floods take over major parts of the country when the rains come in, usually in the latter part of the year; from mid-May towards September.
2022 wasnt any different but this year, the floods went beyond the rains to the spillage of dams which had devastating effects on livelihoods.
In this piece, we take a look at some major floods that occurred this year and how they affected some Ghanaians.
Weija Floods:
Hundreds of houses in Weija, Tetegu, and the surrounding areas were flooded in October, 2022, leaving many residents displaced as a result of the spillage by the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) from the Weija Dam.
According to GWCL, the rainy situation in the Eastern Region during the period contributed to the rise of the water level in the Weija Dam.
Several properties including cars, home appliances, and monies were submerged in the water as a result of the floods.
Some residents had to move out of their homes to seek refuge in other places till the water receded days later before returning to their homes to count their losses.
Some lives were also reportedly lost.
Tidal waves hit Ketu, Ada; scores displaced, stranded:
It was probably one of the biggest floods this year. Tidal waves hit parts of the Volta and Greater Accra regions in April this year.
Homes were inundated with seawater in places like Agavedzi in the Ketu South Municipality of the Volta Region as well as Aklabanya in the Ada West District of the Greater Accra Region, with scores of people being displaced by the waves.
The residents were forced out of their homes and rendered homeless while others salvaged some of their belongings onto portions of the main road while they waited for the water to recede.
Floods in Buipe after Bagre Dam spillage:
Thousands of residents of Buipe in the Central Gonja District of the Savanna Region were displaced by the excess water spilt from the Bagre dam.
More than 1,000 households were submerged with more than 1,000 residents being rendered homeless in the business hub of Buipe.
Madina floods kill two:
Two people reportedly died after a taxi submerged during a rainstorm in Madina, a suburb of the Greater Accra Region.
An eyewitness who spoke to GhanaWeb said that an hour of rain led to the roads and gutters around some parts of Madina, including the Ridco area, becoming heavily flooded, which resulted in the taxi being pushed into one of the big drains that stretch from Ridco to Dome.
According to the witness, the taxi, which had three passengers - a woman and her two children as well as the driver - was flashed by the flood water from Ridco to Madina Warehouse.
He said that a motor rider managed to rescue the mother and one of her children but could not help the driver and the other child.
Eastern Region floods kill 4, with 10 missing:
About 17 municipalities and 4 districts in the Eastern Region were affected by floods some communities in the Eastern Region after heavy downpours.
At least some 4 people were reported dead, and 10 missing by the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO).
Eastern Regional Director NADMO, Kwame Appiah Kodua said the flood occurred because three rivers that run through the region, including the Birim River, the River Densu and the River Ayensu, overflowed their banks as a result of the heavy downpours.
The Member of Parliament (MP) for New Juaben North, Nana Adjei Boateng, on his part said that the floods were a result of the poor drainage system in the region and illegal mining activities, popularly called galamsey.
Kumasi floods kill 3:
Three bodies were found following flooding that occurred at the Ahenema Kokoben suburb of Kumasi on Monday night.
Three people went missing after nearly three hours of torrential rainfall hit the community. The victims were onboard a Kia Truck but jumped off as the flood pulled the truck to the wrong side of the road.
They were subsequently swept away by the heavy floods.

Three persons were washed away by floods at Kwaprow a suburb of Cape Coast in the Central Region after heavy rains on May 30.
The deceased included two old women and a Security Officer working with the University of Cape Coast.
The two old women aged between 80 to 85 years were reportedly asleep in their houses situated along a narrow bridge that got flooded and the water submerged their homes.
Unfortunately, they couldnt run away due to their health situation.
With respect to the University of Cape Coast Security Officer, the report says he was chasing his belongings which were being taken away by the flood but was swept away by the strong current of the water.
Many houses in Kwaprow Community were flooded leaving the residents with no option but to seek refuge at the chiefs palace.

Check out the biggest court stories of the year,"Ghanas legal terrain has had a busy year in 2022 between civil and criminal matters brought before courts for judgement.
GhanaWeb highlights some of the biggest cases that were heard in Ghanaian courts within the year under review.
Supreme Court stops Assin North MP from holding himself as member of legislature
In April 2022, a seven-member Supreme Court panel ruled by a majority of 5-2 that Assin North MP James Gyakye Quayson can no longer perform Parliamentary duties.
This was after the Cape Coast High Court in July 2021 nullified the election of Mr. Quayson after finding he owed allegiance to Canada at the time of filing his nomination forms to contest the polls.
Michael Ankomah Nimfah, a resident of the constituency who filed this election petition in January 2022, initiated another action at the Supreme Court.
After several attempts to nullify the decision, the MP was asked to cease holding himself out as an MP until the determination of a substantive suit filed by Michael Amkomah Nimfah against him at the Supreme Court.
Jomoro MP retains seat in parliament as High Court throws out a petition against her election
One of the many election petitions filed in the aftermath of the 2020 election was against the Member of Parliament for Jomoro Constituency, Dorcas Affo-Toffey.
However, on November 21, 2022, the Sekondi High Court dismissed the petition challenging the eligibility of the National Democratic Congress MP.
The petitioner, Joshua Emuah Kofie, submitted to the court that, at the time of filing her nomination to contest in the 2020 elections, the MP had multiple nationalities, including American and Ivorian citizenships, which is against the 1992 Constitution.
While the court determined that she did not have Ivorian citizenship at the time of filing and contesting in 2020, the MP denied having American citizenship.
Justice Abdulai challenges the constitutionality of Deputy Speaker participating in  voting
A private legal practitioner, Justice Abdulai, filed a suit at the Supreme Court in early 2022, seeking a ruling against a Deputy Speakers right to vote or be counted in forming a quorum in parliament while presiding over proceedings.
But the Supreme Court ruled on March 9 in a unanimous decision that a Deputy Speaker of Parliament retains his voting rights as an MP even when presiding over proceedings.
Subsequently, the private legal practitioner filed a review application to challenge the decision by the apex court.
However, on April 26, 2022, the court dismissed the review application because it was without merit.
Justice Abdulai had argued that in the context of articles 102 and 104 of the 1992 Constitution, a Deputy Speaker was not permitted to count himself for quorum, since he had neither an original nor a casting vote as Speaker presiding.
But the court ruled that any such action by a deputy speaker, as witnessed during the approval of the 2021 budget statement, was constitutionally allowed.
The court thus struck down standing order 109(3), which says a Deputy Speaker or any other member presiding shall not retain his original vote while presiding.
It furthered that the Deputy Speaker could be counted during the quorum for decision-making according to article 104(1)
Nana Agradaa Agradaa
The founder and leader of Heaven Way Champion International Ministries, Evangelist Patricia Oduro Koranteng alias Nana Agradaa, was arrested by the police on October 9, 2022, and pressed with fraud charges.
Her arrest followed multiple reports that the former fetish priestess had defrauded her church members in a supposed money doubling scheme.
The several victims who have since come forward have seen different cases filed against her in at least three different courts.
In all of the cases, she is accused of charlatanic advertising and defrauding by false pretenses.
She has subsequently been released on bail with her trial scheduled to continue in 2023
Aisha Huang
In 2017, a female Chinese national was arrested for allegedly engaging in illegal mining activities.
Aisha Huang as she is popularly known gained notoriety for her galamsey activities and was expected to be prosecuted for her alleged crimes.
However, in 2018, the office of the attorney general filed to discontinue her case. She was subsequently reported to have been deported from the country back to her home country China.
In September 2022, Aisha Huang was again arrested for supposedly sneaking back into Ghana to continue her galamsey activities.
She has been charged for the sale and purchase of minerals in Accra without a licence and engaging in illegal mining without a licence.
On Friday, September 16, 2022, the Attorney General again filed four new charges against Aisha Huang in an Accra High Court for her crimes committed between 2015 and 2017.
The four charges are:
Count One: Undertaking a mining operation without a licence contrary to section 99(2)(a) of the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006, Act 703 as amended by the Minerals and Mining (Amendment) Act 2019, Act 995.
Count Two: Facilitating the participation of persons engaged in a mining operation contrary to section 99 (2)(a) & (3) of the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006, Act 703 as amended by the Minerals and Mining (Amendment) Act 2019, Act 995.
Count Three: Illegal employment of foreign nationals contrary to section 24 of the Immigration Act, 2000 (Act 573).
Count Four: Entering Ghana while prohibited from re-entry contrary to section 20(4) of the Immigration Act, 2000, Act 573.
Meanwhile, the Accra Circuit Court 9 which is hearing the charges of the sale and purchase of minerals in Accra without a licence and engaging in illegal mining without a licence against Aisha Huang has denied her bail on two occasions.
The Chinese national is expected back in court on Wednesday, October 12, 2022.
Barker-Vormawor
Barker-Vormawor was on February 14 arraigned before the Ashaiman District Court and charged with two counts of treason felony.
His plea was reserved and was later granted bail by the Tema High Court presided over by Justice Daniel Mensah.
The #FixTheCountry convener Oliver Barker-Vormawor was granted bail by the Tema High Court in the sum of GHc2M with two sureties.
Oliver was arrested upon his arrival from the UK Thursday, February 11 after he threatened to stage a coup in Ghana if the controversial e-levy is passed.
The police in a statement said his Facebook post contained a clear statement of intent with a possible will to execute a coup in his declaration of intent to subvert the constitution of the Republic.
On August 1, 2022, the Ashaiman District Court presided by, Eleanor Barnes Kakra Botwe, committed #FixTheCountry Movement lead convener Oliver Barker-Vormawor to the High Court to stand trial for treason felony.
This was after the committal proceedings were conducted with the bill of Indictment indicating the States readiness to prosecute him was moved.
Meanwhile, the Attorney Generals office is yet to commence the High Court proceedings.
Former Deputy Health Minister, Ato-Forson put on trial for causing financial loss to the state
Former Deputy Health Minister, Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson, who is also the NDC Member of Parliament (MP)
for Ajumako Enyan Esiam, and the Ranking Member on the Finance Committee of Parliament, has been charged with Sylvester Anemana, a former Chief Director of the Ministry of Health and Richard Jakpa, a businessman, for allegedly causing financial loss of 2.37 million to the state in a deal to purchase some 200 ambulances for the country between 2014 and 2016.

These are the ministries Ghanaians criticized the most for poor performance in 2022,"The president of the republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, was elected by the people of Ghana to rule them because of the vision he has for the country, which was outlined in his manifesto.
But the actualization of the president's vision is done by ministries and their agencies, which are headed by his (the presidents) appointees and public servants, through the enactment and implementation of policies and programmes.
So, not only do Ghanaians hold the president accountable for the promise he made, but they also scrutinize ministers and their ministries for the effectiveness of policies and programmes they are implementing to attain the president's vision.
This article looks at the ministries out of the 30 central government ministries that were criticized the most in 2022 for the poor execution of policies and programmes of the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government.
Ministry of Finance:
The Ministry of Finance, which is headed by Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, was arguably the most criticized government agency in 2022 because of the poor performance of Ghana's economy.
Some Ghanaians, including leading members of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), have accused the minister of being the cause of the hardship in the country due to his reckless borrowing and poor management of the countrys resources.
The sector minister was also berated by Ghanaians for the implementation of the governments Electronic Transfer Levy (E-Levy).
Ofori-Atta also came under heavy scrutiny after the government decided to seek an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout after the minister categorically stated that Ghana as a proud nation would not go to the IMF for a bailout.
Members of Parliament from the ruling NPP even demanded that the president fire him if he wants them to support the government's business that comes before the House. The main reason they gave was the poor performance of the economy and the governments U-turn to seek an IMF bailout.
The minority caucus of Parliament also filed a vote of a censure motion against Ofori-Atta accusing him of corruption and misrepresentation of figures on the economic fundaments among others.
Ministry of Food and Agriculture:
Another ministry heavily criticized by Ghanaians was the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which was led by Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto.
The ministry was heavily criticised for the implementation of the government's flagship Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) programme which many say was poor and was the main reason for the continuous rise in the prices of staple foods in the country.
Some notable Ghanaians, including the Executive Secretary of the Media Foundation for West Africa, Sulemana Brimah, accused the ministry of grossly misrepresenting Ghana's food production levels.
The ministrys move to sell food products under the PFJ Market initiative, which involved the transportation of agricultural products from farm gates to urban centres in order to sell them at relatively low prices, was also heavily criticized.
Ministry of Communication and Digitalization:
The Ministry of Communication and Digitalization was also heavily criticized by Ghanaians, particularly for the implementation of the SIM card re-registration exercise.
The sectors minister, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, was heavily criticised for insisting that the National Identification Card of Ghana (the Ghana Card) should be the only identification document needed for the registration exercise.
She was also chastised for imposing a registration deadline despite the fact that many Ghanaians lacked the Ghana Card required to register their SIM cards, and for restricting communication services to unregistered SIM card users.
Ursula got on the bad side of Ghanaians for some comments she made in the wake of the implementation of the E-Levy. She was particularly criticised for saying that Ghanaians who can make transfers worth over GHS100 a day are rich.
Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources
The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, which is headed by Samuel Abu Jinapor, was also in the news in 2022 for the wrong reasons.
Ghanaians have slammed the ministry in particular for leading the country's fight against illegal small-scale mining (galamsey), with many calling the effort a failure. The ministry was also accused of protecting politicians behind the menace. One example is Bernard Antwi Boasiako, a.k.a. Chairman Wontumi's handling of the alleged involvement of Akonta Mining, the NPP's Ashanti Regional company, in illegal mining.
Again, the ministry was also berated by Ghanaians for the declassification of portions of the Achimota Forest Reserve land after allegations that the land was sold to some politicians. A purported will of the late Chief Executive of the Forestry Commission, Kwadwo Owusu Afriyie (Sir John), showed that he had willed portions of the Achimota Forest Land that were declassified.
Ministry of Education
Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum, Minister of Education, and his ministry were heavily chastised in 2022, particularly for the implementation of the Free Senior High School (SHS) program.
Many Ghanaians were not happy with the frequent shortage of food in public senior high schools in the country, which led to parents sending food to their wards and some schools closing down.
The ministry was also heavily criticised for its failure to distribute educational material, including textbooks, to both basic and secondary schools, as well as the failure to pay allowances to trainees of colleges of education and nursing in the country.
The sector minister was also accused of misusing US$1.2 million in World Bank funds intended for a teacher training program.

"Stubborn Academy, 'sika mp dede' and other popular slangs that trended in 2022","A lot of these slangs usually started with some famous people using them in an address or a popular post, or simply using them to describe something.
And being the people they are and with the clout they carry, a number of Ghanaians just jumped onto those terms, and before long, they became terminologies that were on the lips of many citizens.
But the best part of these slangs is that they cut across sectors and the personalities in those areas, from politics to entertainment and even to social media terminologies.
Lets take a look at some of them and also find out how they came about. We will also show you how some of them are commonly used.
Stubborn Academy:
During the recent national SIM re-registration exercise in the country, there were instances where the Minister of Communication and Digitalization, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, was forced to extend the deadlines for citizens to get their registrations done.
But as it turned out, almost every time the deadlines were close, that was when the service centers of the various telecommunication companies in the country would be flooded with people.
It was always an eleventh-hour thing for most citizens, and that gave cause for the Member of Parliament for Ningo-Prampram, Sam Nartey George, who was one of the people who fought against the national exercise, to give it a name.
His tweet of July 30, 2022, read, Stubborn Academy. Cheers, caught on with many people, and soon enough, it became a regular term for people to use in their daily interactions.
It is worth noting too that Medikal, a Ghanaian musician, has a song with the same title, Stubborn Academy.
Sika mp dede:
Following his address to the nation at the peak of the economic hardships that have been experienced in the year 2022, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo made a statement that caught on with many people, albeit for both positive and negative reasons.
""Fellow Ghanaians, as the French would say, largent naime pas le bruit, to wit, money does not like noise, sika mp dede. Where there is chaos, where there is noise, where there is unrest, you will not find money. If you talk down your money, it will go down. If you allow some unidentifiable person to talk down your money, it will go down,"" he said.
When many people were looking for messages of hope from the president and were intrigued by this particular Twa statement, it quickly became a term that people referred to.
The term has since stuck with people.
A song was eventually produced with those same words, confirming how popular the slang was.
Largent naime pas le bruit:
Not a particularly strong French-speaking country, although it is surrounded on all borders, except to the south, by francophone countries, many Ghanaians were intrigued to hear their president use the term largent naime pas le bruit while addressing them on October 30, 2022.
With many variations of the French phrase becoming common in the country, this slang was undoubtedly one of the most commonly used in the year.
Wei:
The term ""wei"" was most commonly used on Twitter.
It came from popular actor and broadcaster Akrobeto, who uses the term as a prelude to teasing people who are funny or engaged in things that he uses for his comic news show, The Real News, on UTV.
The influence of Akrobeto made it easy for people to also use them in equally appropriate ways, and on Twitter, it became a usual term that was used by many users.
Wotowoto:
Originally a term from Nigeria, the use of wotowoto, which literally means plenty or in abundance became a common slang used in Ghana too.
Being two countries with many similarities, it is unclear what exactly increased its use so much in Ghana, but before long, many people began using it to describe situations in which people are threatened with being mercilessly beaten.
I will beat you, wotowoto, is one way the term is used.
Ashawo Season:
Ghanaian artiste, Kwesi Arthur, granted an interview in late 2021, where he was asked what he projects for the year 2022.
In his response, he said he expects the year to be an ashawo season.
The slang caught on and became another one of the popular ones that Ghanaians used.
Which other popular slangs of 2022 do you remember? Let us know in the comments section.

Sex conversations that freaked Ghanaians out in 2022,"Sex is a taboo topic in Ghanaian households, however, it has transcended cultural boundaries and dominated media conversations from social media to traditional media in the form of news and entertainment.
Among the top 10 websites that Ghanaians visited the most in 2021, two were pornography websites. This is according to the online visibility management and content marketing platform, semrush.com. This statistic drives the argument that Ghanaians may not want to discuss sex, but there is interest in the topic.
2022 was a melting point of several sexual discussions and this article seeks to highlight the most prominent ones that shook the foundations of Ghanaian culture.
Gay rights and the anti-LGBTQ+ bill in parliament
The 2021 discussion about criminalizing homosexuality and advocacy for gay rights crossed into 2022 after the Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill was introduced in parliament in March 2021.
The Bill divided the Ghanaian populace into those in support of gay rights and those against it who have been largely described as homophobic. The latter often sexualize homosexuality on social media leaving the conversation to be about sex than personality.
Sam George is an MP leading the support for the anti-LGBTQ+ bill
Flogging of a couple in a viral sex tape in Wa
In June 2022, a video showing the public flogging of a couple in Wa trended on social media sparking a debate about the consequences of recording sex tapes.
The couple had earlier recorded their sexual activity, and it went viral in their community sparking outrage from community leaders who sanctioned the public flogging.
The conversations were not conclusive on whether it is acceptable to record sex acts in private or not. But it was generally against public flogging.

Afia Schwarzeneggers alleged sexual relations with Chairman Wontumi
Since the issue is still in court, we cant say much but highlight it as one of the issues that sparked conversations on social media. She swore with a bottle of schnapps and cracked eggs that she has slept with Chairman Wontumi and he filed a GHC 2,000,000 defamation suit against her.

Serwaa Broni presidential affair
It was a roller coaster with the Serwaa Broni scandal which alleged that President Akufo-Addo was having an extra-marital affair with a Canada-based Ghanaian woman who shared images and chats to prove her claim. She also accused security operatives of attacking her to recover the evidence she claims to have had.
This allegation sparked a lot of discussion about sexual relations between public figures and how they protect their images and the affair from leaking. Bloggers and politicians had a field day and there was no reaction from the president. The discussion on this topic may not make it to 2023.

Prophecies that dominated 2021 December 31st night services,"Every year, Ghanaians anticipate December 31 watch night services held across churches. This is because it is known as the day some renowned prophets release tall lists of prophecies for the new year.
Many Ghanaians are always eager to hear what these prophets will predict for the coming year.
2022 was a bit different because the Ghana Police Service cautioned the Christian Council that prophets who caused fear and panic with their prophecies would be arrested. This reduced the number of revelations these men of God dished out to the public.
Despite all the cautioning, in 2022, three popular prophets, Bishop Salifu Amoako, Rev Owusu Bempah, and Prophet Nigel Gaisie topped the trends with their prophecies.
As 2022 comes to an end, GhanaWeb takes a look at the prophecies by some of these prophecies that dominated headlines.
Nigel Gaisie drops prophecies about Umuofia with details from Ghana
Prophet Nigel adopted a strategy to deliver his prophecies about Ghana without directly referring to the country.
Right before delving into his prophecies, the controversial pastor issued a disclaimer saying his prophecies will be about a nation called Umuofia and not Ghana.
Strikingly, however, were the similarities between details about the nation of Umuofia and Ghana as disclosed in his prophecies.
Some Prophecies by Nigel Gaisie about Umuofia (Ghana)
I saw a heavy cloud like the cloud of darkness covering the head of state of Umuofia. Lets take this prophecy very seriously, I saw a cloud of darkness covering the head of state of Umuofia. I saw that his deputy is using mediums to trigger the quick passing away of the head of state. I saw in the realm of the spirit that the shoe of the big man is being worn by the deputy. I saw in the nation of Umuofia that something that has happened there is about to reoccur again, he stated.
Prophet Nigel also warned of a terror attack in the nation of Umuofia. He warned that a pending explosive attack will occur in the nation of Umuofia and that the attack will be an external one with internal collaboration.
Without mincing words, Prophet Nigel said the Lord revealed to him that former President John Dramani Mahama will win power in 2024 but warned that the current government of Umuofia will do everything to subvert the ballot.
The hand of the Lord rested upon me and carried me into the election of 2024 or 2025 in the nation of Umuofia, and the Lord told me to tell them, to tell the CND people they should forget about the Ashanti Region. They should focus more on the Northern region. Because the election will be determined by these two regions. I saw a flag with red and black taking dominance. But let the CND people focus more on the northern region.
Again, the Lord carried me in the realm and said I should say. The Lord said if the CND people of Umuofia do not wake up they will use systems and the EC and the NIA to twist the agenda and the will of the people. So let the CND people be more vigilant.
He also predicted that 2022 will be a difficult year with a famine similar to that of 1983 likely to occur. On the works of parliament, Prophet Nigel said there is a conscious effort to reduce the minority seats and added that there will be a by-election.
He also gave several prophecies about the speaker of parliament, the NPPs internal election, and the Greater Accra Regional Minister.
He added that the current Special Prosecutor will resign just like his predecessor but issued all the prophecies alluding to the nation of Umuofia.
List of Owusu Bempahs coded prophecies
Leader of the Glorious Word Power Ministries International, Isaac Owusu Bempah, begged his congregation to accept a proverbial edition of prophecies during the 2021 Watch Night and Cross Over event at the church headquarters in Accra.
Whiles admitting that this years session may not have been enjoyable as previous years due to the manner of prophecies, he tasked them to accept it as such and pray about the issues to the best of their abilities.
GhanaWeb lists a number of the proverbial prophecies that Owusu Bempah delivered during the well-attended service that ended in the wee hours of January 1, 2022.
Prayer for Parliament
Owusu Bempah requested prayers for MPs because two persons holding candlesticks clashed causing their flames to be extinguished. We need to remember Parliament in prayers, we will remember them in prayers, he stated.
Escalating tribal conflict
Without giving specifics or mentioning in which region, the prophet said two tribes with serious disagreements were revealed to him and the spat became a public issue and military intervention was required. The offshoot was not palatable so we need to pray about it, he added.
Prayers for Asanteman
I saw darkness over Asanteman, I will pray that God intervenes, he stated.
Prayer for people living along the coast
We will pray for people living along the coast. I saw a man who was in the shape of water and he had walked to places inhabited by people. When he was going back, he went along with some people from the living world.
We will pray water does not invade people, he added.
A religious leader who travelled and never returned
I saw a religious leader travelling, when he went he stayed on and delayed for so long and I saw nothing more about him. Prayers must go on, he stated.
A big musician to get into trouble
Owusu Bempah announced that big musicians must be remembered especially the very prominent and popular ones.
I saw a popular musician who is well respected and largely followed, lose his hair and I saw his bare head. He lost all his hair. We will pray for prominent musicians, he added.
Combative Kangaroos in security uniforms
I also saw a kangaroo wearing military attire and another in police attire fighting and all trees around were in commotion. Trees were trying to intervene but it was impossible, even after a leader tried to intervene and it came down a bit.
""(Let us pray) if not, Kangaroo in military and police attire will clash,"" he stated.
Sleigh drawn by horses and donkeys crash
Owusu Bempah said he saw a sleigh with horses in lead. The eyes of the horses lights like car headlights. I saw donkeys, horses and sleighs going at speed. The street before them rose and they entered a ditch. What emerged was bad.
Encounter with silent destructive darkness
I saw darkness walking and I asked where it was going and it discarded me. It refused to answer me, darkness stop, what are you doing, it refused to respond.
I saw darkness go and stand at a big house and cover it with its hands, whiles rising, I heard shouts and screams in the house all subsequent questions, it refused and left the land of the living. I didnt see it again.
In his closing remarks, he stated: 2022, if you walk well with God, you will be blessed. There will be marriage, which means the end time is almost here. The Bible says women will be given in marriage. Take good care of yourselves.
Details of Elisha Salifu Amoakos prophecies
During his first Sunday of 2022 service, the Founder and Leader of the Alive Chapel International, Archbishop-elect Elisha Salifu Amoako listed out some prophecies about the nations of the world.
He called for prayers to be made against a lot of deaths and major confusion.
Starting from the United States of America, right down to Ghana, the prophet told his congregation about how there have been major attacks initiated in the realms of the spirit against major personalities and groups of persons in the world.
The angel of the Lord carried me into the nations, into the kingdoms. And the Lord said, in 2022, beginning from this month, the enemy has designed destruction and mind-boggling destruction against the world leaders. Im talking about the present and the past. If we dont pray for them, this year will be a year of major destructions.
And the angel settled me in the United States and I saw a major death; a national one in the United States of America and the Lord said, Son of Man, pray against this destruction against the world leaders, he said.
Archbishop-elect Salifu Amoako also spoke about what he said will be major deaths in India that will be occasioned by heavy rains, resulting in floods.
And the angel settled me in the land of India. The Indian problem this year is going to be rain; rainfall will wipe away many lives. It will be heavy rainfall ... with heavy floods that is destroying people. The Lord said I pray also for the nation of India, he said.
In Africa, he began his prophecies from Nigeria, calling for prayers to be made for the pastors in the country because a wind of many deaths has been directed at them.
He also urged the actors in the country to take their prayer lives seriously otherwise they will be very surprised by the way people in the industry will die.
Then He brought me to Africa and when I came to Africa, we settled in Nigeria. The Lord said, this year, certain high men of God need to pray in Nigeria because the enemy will kill some men of God; certain men of God, not only Nigeria too. Some men of God are going to die in Ghana; many men of God. Youd be surprised the way its going to happen. We need to pray.
And I looked and I saw actors in Nigeria, and many of them, they have names, and the enemy attacked them and they started falling one after the other. The Lord says we should pray, he said.
In Ghana, the prophet spoke to the media and the countrys lawmakers, stating that major attacks have been planned for them and that there is the need for prayers to be said for them, against all those evil.
Salifu Amoako also said that the two main political parties should be guided since a major confusion is likely to break out between them.
Then when he brought me to Ghana, this year, all the media houses  the media houses, the media men, need to pray because theyll be attacked and therell be a major occurrence of death in the sector of the media. The Lord said we should pray because the media will be attacked.
Number two, in Ghana here, the Lord said we must pray for the parliamentarians because this year will be a year of political confusion. There will be a major confusion between NPP and NDC. I see a lot of confusion but the Lord said we should remember them in prayer, he said
He also spoke about directly sending an information to a sitting president who needs foreknowledge on something that is to happen between now and February of 2023; prayer for the Queen of England; that a Christian will rise up to lead in Nigeria; confusion in Uganda in June; and for the former president of Cote dIvoire, Laurent Gbagbo to be prayed for because there is a plan to poison him since the people want him back but people in power do not.

Iconic U-turns made by the Akufo-Addo government in 2022,"Effective communication, many experts have said, is a very critical part of the governance process of any nation.
According to experts, this builds trust between the government and the citizenry.
It, therefore, does not help when the leader of the government, the president, makes public pronouncements that are contrary to statements his appointees have made or makes statements that later have to be explained or clarified by his appointees.
Yet, there were instances in 2022 when President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo made some statements that led to some mistrust in his government, which left his appointees scrambling to explain.
Here are some of these instances:
'I'm not so sure Aisha Huang was deported'  Akufo-Addo
President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, in an interview in Ho, during his 2022 tour of the Volta Region, contradicted statements by some of his appointees that illegal small-scale mining (galamsey) kingpin, Aisha Huang, was deported from Ghana in 2018.
""... I am not still sure whether she was, in fact, deported or whether she fled the country the first time and has now come back or whatever. There still seems to be some uncertainty about it.
""Whichever way it is, she has become a sort of nickname for all that the 'galamsey' represents and also, unfortunately, for the involvement of Chinese nationals in this illicit trade,"" he said.
But Information Minister Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, in an attempt to explain the president's comments, said the president used a figure of speech and the most important thing was that Aisha Huang was repatriated in 2018, contrary to earlier reports that she was deported.
He went on to explain the difference between deportation and repatriation.
To him, the Minister of Interior has the power to ""deport"" while the Immigration Service has the power to ""repatriate"" via notice.
""While the Minister for Interior can deport, the Immigration Service cannot. The instrument which the Immigration Service uses in such circumstances is a repatriation notice. Either way, the effect was that she was caused to exit from Ghana at the material moment,"" Kojo Oppong-Nkrumah tweeted.
There will be no haircuts  Akufo-Addo:
President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo refuted suggestions that his government would buy off government bonds at rates lower than their expected returns  ""haircut on Government bonds"".
Addressing the nation on measures being taken by the government to rescue the economy, on Sunday, October 31, Akufo-Addo said: ""I also want to assure all Ghanaians that no individual or institutional investor, including pension funds, in government treasury bills or instruments will lose their money, as a result of our ongoing IMF negotiations.
""There will be no ""haircuts"", so I urge all of you to ignore the false rumours, just as, in the banking sector clean-up, government ensured that the 4.6 million depositors affected by the exercise did not lose their deposits.""
He cautioned, ""those who make it a habit of publishing falsehoods, which result in panic in the system, I say to them that the relevant state agencies will act against such persons"".
But the Minister of Information, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, later came out to explain Akufo-Addo's assurances that there will be no haircut covers only principals.
""My understanding is that no principals will be touched. No principals will have a haircut. The debt sustainability strategy is yet to be announced in full.
""When they are done with the rest of the strategy, and they come out and do a full announcement, we will have clarity on the form that the debt restructuring will take,"" the information minister said.
My government has constructed 10,875 kilometres of new roads  Akufo-Addo
President Akufo-Addo during his presentation of the State of the Nation Address, stated that the greatest infrastructure achievement his government has registered is in the road sector.
Addressing the country in parliament, he said his government had completed, upgraded, and improved over 10,000 kilometers of road in the space of 5 years.
President Akufo-Addo even gestured that the Members of Parliament (MPs) should open their eyes to see the roads.
""It is in the road sector that we have registered the greatest infrastructure achievement. I know that the word 'unprecedented' is often used with careless abandon in our public discourse, but I use it carefully and purposefully"", the President said.
""In the five years of my government, so far, more roads have been built, improved, and upgraded than at any other equivalent period under any government in the history of Ghana. Some ten thousand, eight hundred and seventy-five (10,875) kilometres of new roads have been constructed in these five (5) years,"" the president said.
In an attempt to clarify the president's figures, the Roads and Highways Ministry said the 10,875 kilometers of roads constructed included ongoing work on unpaved roads.
According to the ministry, any activity on the road amounts to construction.
The construction work the Ministry said it does on unpaved roads includes grading, gravelling, re-gravelling, and spot improvement.
""In 2017, the total network size was 78,402 kilometers. As of the end of 2021, the projected network size has increased to 94,203 kilometers. The data on completed works has subsequently been updated to 10,875 km as of the end of February 2022.
""Over the past 5 years, a lot of investment had gone into both the paved and unpaved roads to improve the riding quality on our roads. The 10,875 kilometres of roads constructed have been on both paved and unpaved roads,"" a statement by the ministry read.

"Daring, unfazed and vilified: Meet 2022 Woman of the year","There should have been a debate on this subject, but it seems that politically, and looking back on the year in retrospect, Sarah Adwoa Safo has no competition when it comes to names of females who have dominated news headlines for the most part of the last 365 days.
The Member of Parliament for Dome Kwabenya has not just easily earned herself the coveted title of ""Woman of the Year 2022,"" but she has also endeared herself to several good and bad energies.
But even more interesting has been the fact that not only have these energies come from her usual opponents, but a number of them too have come from within her very background: from her colleague MPs in the Majority or New Patriotic Party (NPP).
And someone might just say, well, it was expected.
So, what are the specific reasons that this prestigious award would fall so easily at the feet of this young, yet experienced MP?
Let's travel down memory lane to the first time her name became a major talking point in the year. This was when it was noticed that Sarah Adwoa Safo had been absent from parliament  her constitutionally mandated place of work, for quite a long time.
But even more profound was the fact that her presence was needed for a crucial government business; one that the president of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, through his Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, was trying so had to push through the evenly-split Parliament of Ghana.
The controversial Electronic Transfer Levy (E-Levy), which was eventually passed under very controversial circumstances, was what the country needed the Dome Kwabenyas presence so much for, but as it turned out, her presence wasnt so greatly needed.
In fact, ahead of the vote on the E-Levy, which had gone through many stages of parliamentary procedures, arguments and counter-arguments, and near fisticuffs on the floor of parliament, the Majority (of which Adwoa Safo is a member of), had declared that with or without her, they would push through with their vote.
In an interview in February 2022, Habib Iddrisu, the Deputy Majority Whip, stated that if history is any guide, the House has been able to pass many bills into law without the full support of majority MPs.
Its not cast in stone that without the presence of Adwoa Safo the E-Levy will not be passed, he said.
Adwoa Safo holding government to ransom:
One of the people who many believed knew the exact whereabouts of Sarah Adwoa Safo, was the Assin Central Member of Parliament, Kennedy Agyapong. This, beyond the fact that he was a colleague of hers, was mainly because he has children with her.
But interestingly enough, he was one of the people who criticized her the most for staying away from parliament and from the country.
According to him, the lawmakers conduct was tantamount to holding the governing NPP to ransom.
NPP has a problem. As for me na truth go kill me. I will tell you the way it is... Adwoa Sarfo is holding the whole NPP to ransom. It is the truth Im saying.
""I wont cover it up because I have 2 children with her so when she is doing something which is wrong, [I wont say it]. What is going on in NPP is very annoying. We have pampered some people to the extent that they have become tin gods, he said in Twi on February 8, 2022.
There were also claims that the Dome-Kwabenya MP had been absent for that long because she wanted to be made the Deputy Majority Leader in parliament.
Adwoa Safo absent from parliament for 15 days:
By February 18, 2022, Adwoa Safos absence from parliament had officially entered its 15th day.
Already unhappy with her prolonged absence without any concrete reasons or constant communication with them, some members of the Majority Caucus started processes to remove her as an MP.
The MPs on the same side of the House with her had hinted that she will be reported formally to the Privileges Committee for onward action.
But this was a decision that was, rather surprisingly, fought back by the people who should ordinarily be her opponents in politics: the National Democratic Congress (NDC) MPs.
Minority for Adwoa Safo:
The Member of Parliament for Adaklu Constituency, Kwame Governs Agboza, questioned why some members of the Majority in Parliament were attacking the Member of Parliament for Dome-Kwabenya, Sarah Adwoa Safo, as though she was the only MP who had absented herself from parliament for a long time.
According to him, there are a number of MPs who only come to the chamber to break the 15-day rule after they have been away for a while.
Speaking in an interview with GhanaWeb, the MP quizzed why there is so much interest in Adwoa Safo who has been away from the house for a while.
There are a number of Members of Parliament who always come here to break the 15 days rule. They come when the 15 days is about to elapse then they come and do one day or even half day, so why is Adwoa Safo of so much of interest currently? Look into the chamber for some people you even hardly know if they are still Members of Parliament. So, I dont even see the fixation on Adwoa Safo.
The NPP is being so callous, unfair to Adwoa Safo. She has done everything for the party and even won seat for the party, today, you are telling her she and her father are nobody and the party doesnt belong her, but she has never claimed the party belongs to her, he noted.
Chief of Staff paid Adwoa Safo GH120,000, Agyapong alleges:
And then there was another major accusation made by Kennedy Agyapong, MP for Assin Central, about the whole Adwoa Safo saga.
He alleged that the Chief of Staff, Akosua Frema Osei-Opare, gave him GH120,000 to be deposited into the bank account of Dome-Kwabenya MP, Sarah Adwoa Safo, to enable her return to parliament and work for the government.
""I have vowed not to insult like I will blast her today. Adwoa Safo, Chief of Staff called me; I went there and [she] said now this is what she is saying, I swear [on] my mother's grave, Chief of Staff gave me GH120,000 to deposit in Adwoa Safo's bank account.
""I put the money there; I deposited it in her Fidelity bank account; you can ask her PA if what I am saying is not the truth. I deposited the money there. Now, because of how she is behaving, we are in opposition,"" a furious Kennedy Agyapong said on Asaase Radio on Tuesday, February 22.
Petition to remove 3 NPP MPs:
After some time had elapsed, there was a petition made to parliament by a former Member of Parliament for Kumbungu, Ras Mubarak, seeking the Speakers powers to invoke Article 97(1) on some absentee MPs who have breached the 15-day rule in the House.
According to him, four Members of Parliament all absented themselves from the Chamber for more than fifteen sitting days without the permission of the Speaker.
The MPs are Adwoa Safo, MP for Dome Kwabenya; Kennedy Agyapong, MP for Assin South; Henry Quartey, MP for Ayawaso Central; and Ebenezer Kojo Kum, MP for Ahanta.
I write to petition your high office to respectfully enforce the provisions of article 97(1) c of the 1992 constitution of Ghana and parliaments Standing Order number 16(1).
It has come to my notice through parliaments Hansard, and newspaper and radio reports that some four Members of Parliament, namely Hon. Sarah Adwoa Safo, MP for Dome-Kwabenya; Hon. Henry Quartey, MP for Ayawaso Central; Hon. Ebenezer Kojo Kum, MP for Ahanta West; and Hon. Ken Ohene Agyapong, MP for Assin Central have all absented themselves from Parliament for more than fifteen sittings of a meeting of Parliament without the permission of Mr. Speaker in writing, he wrote.
Bagbin refers 3 NPP MPs to Privileges Committee:
After admitting the petition by Ras Mubarak, Alban Bagbin referred the case of the three MPs to the Privileges Committee.
Privileges Committee, you are so directed, handle the matter, report back to the House, he directed.
It would take a lot of back and forth, refusals to attend to the invitation of the Committee, to a report to the Speaker of Parliament recommending that action be taken on the three but Bagbin once again saved the Dome-Kwabenya MP.
Bagbin saves Adwoa Safo once again:
After many looked forward to the verdict that the Speaker of Parliament would deliver on the fate of Sarah Adwoa Safo and the two other MPs, he dipped a lot of hopes when he eventually did.
On Wednesday, October 26, 2022, he dismissed the objection of the Majority Leader to the admissibility of the committee report for the consideration of the house.
As I have noted in this ruling, the decision (sic) on not to admit a motion is the exclusive preserve of the Speaker. In view of the foregoing, the House is well within its right to receive and consider reports of the committee and make a determine arising out of the consideration.
In the circumstances, it is my ruling that the motion was rightfully admitted and the report of the committee is subject to the consideration of the house. It goes without saying that the (sic) objection of the Majority Leader today (sic) is hereby dismissed... he concluded his verdict.
Adwoa Safo sacked as gender minister:
It must be stated that months earlier, and after a lot of expectations, the President of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, officially sacked Sarah Adwoa Safo as Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection.
According to a statement signed by Eugene Arhin, Director of Communications, Office of the President, the presidents decision was according to Article 81(a) of the 1992 Constitution.
The statement added that Cecilia Abena Dapaah, Minister, Sanitation and Water Resources, will continue as the caretaker minister until a substantive minister is appointed.
In accordance with article 81(a) of the Constitution, the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has revoked the appointment of Hon. Sarah Adwoa Safo, Member of Parliament for Dome Kwabenya, as Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection, with immediate effect.
The Minister for Sanitation and Water Resources, Madam Cecilia Abena Dapaah, will continue to act as caretaker Minister for the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, until such a time that President Akufo-Addo appoints a substantive Minister, the statement from the Presidency concluded.
Adwoa Safo finally resumes parliament duties:
On Friday, November 11, 2022, GhanaWeb's lenses in parliament captured Sarah Adwoa Safo on the floor of the House. She was seen interacting with the former Minister for Works and Housing and MP for Abuakwa, Samuel Atta Akyea.
Adwoa Safo's return to the House came after her aide, Nana Dubin Kwapong, indicated that she was having discussions with the leadership of the Majority caucus before resuming her parliamentary duties.
In her first interaction with the media on her return, she ascribed thanks to all who had supported her in her absence.
I greet all my constituents. As their Member of Parliament, by the grace of God, I have finally returned to the Chamber... the reception has been good... Im now back to continue my duties and today is the first day and Im hoping that the subsequent weeks are going to be good.
It feels good to be back, she said.
There is more that this article has not adequately captured but in general, these are the major things that make the personality, Sarah Adwoa Safo the Woman of the Year, in GhanaWebs projections.

Three times Akufo-Addos statements infuriated Ghanaians in 2022,"2022 is undoubtedly one of the toughest years Ghanaians, particularly those who did not face the drought in the 1980s, have seen.
Many expect the father of the country, the president, to give hope to the citizenry with his public pronouncements. Unfortunately, some statements President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo made added insult to injury for many Ghanaians.
The presidents comments that annoyed Ghanaians were mostly made during his tour of some parts of the country.
Here are three statements by Akufo-Addo that did not sit well with many Ghanaians:
To those of you saying bad things about me in the Ashanti Region, I will shame you all  Akufo-Addo
President Akufo-Addo, while speaking during a sod-cutting ceremony for the Suame Interchange on October 18, 2022, as part of his Ashanti Region tour, berated his political detractors in the region.
According to him, these people will be shamed one by one for the numerous things he has done for the people of the region, which is considered the 'political world bank' of his party, the New Patriotic Party (NPP).
President Akufo-Addo stated that for the past six years that he has been in office, the people of the Ashanti Region have benefitted enough from his government; therefore, his detractors cannot say otherwise.
""And to those of you going around saying bad things about me in the Ashanti Region, one after the other, they are all going to be shamed convincingly today, tomorrow and the day after.
""In spite of our present difficulties, which I know will be gone as soon as possible, I continue to be excited about the future prospects of the nation, and I urge all Ghanaians to join hands in building the Ghana that we want, we can realize it if we all work at it,"" he said.
Your threats to vote against the NPP don't frighten me  Akufo-Addo
The president once again raised eyebrows in an interview on OTEC FM during his tour of the Ashanti Region when he stated how unfazed he was about the NPP losing the next general elections.
He explained that while there are threats to vote against them, he is unmoved, adding that the intimidation of voting against the NPP due to unfulfilled promises or lack of development under his tenure is a voter's personal decision he cannot be bothered about.
""People make those kinds of threats; they don't frighten me. Somebody votes for you, and somebody supports you. It's because they want you to do certain things for them. I understand that. But there is no need for people to say that if I am unable to do this and that... those are their own issues to deal with. Of course, I will do it (the road).
""But if it comes to the election and you choose to vote for the NDC, that is your own issue; that is not my worry because nobody holds your thumb to vote; it is your own work. The important thing is that I understand my responsibility, and we will deal with it,"" the president said.
I'm not so sure if Aisha Huang was deported - Akufo-Addo
In September 2022, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo contradicted statements by some of his appointees that illegal small-scale mining (galamsey) kingpin, Aisha Huang, was deported from Ghana in 2018.
Speaking in an interview on Stone City Radio in Ho during his tour of the Volta Region, which GhanaWeb monitored, Akufo-Addo expressed uncertainty about whether Aisha Huang was deported.
According to the president, it is likely that the 'galamsey' queen was never deported but fled the country in 2018.
""... I am not still sure whether she was, in fact, deported or whether she fled the country the first time and has now come back or whatever. There still seems to be some uncertainty about it.
""Whichever way it is, she has become a sort of nickname for all that the 'galamsey' represents and also, unnfortunately, for the involvement of Chinese nationals in this illicit trade,"" he said.

Most controversial statements made by politicians in 2022,"It is arguably inevitable to stay on the safe bench as a politician. One may make statements against their opponents or unintentionally make a comment which may provoke some reaction.
There was a list of these in the year 2022. Some quite interesting ones.
As we wrap up the year, GhanaWeb has compiled a list of such remarks that have got Ghanaians talking;
I will not resign; its like abandoning my children  Ofori-Atta:
This year was not necessarily good for the finance minister considering the economic status of the country, taxes that have largely been protested, and the countrys debt situation.
There have been calls for his resignation time and again, mostly over mismanagement allegations but an announcement that the country was heading for an IMF bailout appeared to have courted even more calls for his head.
A number of Ghanaians; CSOs and individuals alike called for the finance minister to give up his position for another more capable individual who perhaps will be able to turn around the fortunes of the country.
In response to these calls, Ken Ofori-Atta disagreed. His arguments were that a resignation, particularly at a time like that will suggest that he is turning his back on Ghanaians. He further likened the situation to a father who was giving up on his children because of circumstances beyond his control.
It is almost like telling a father to resign from his children because he is changed his mind. There are times that decisions have to be made for the survival of a country and therefore if circumstances such as COVID or the Ukraine war occur which are not typical, it does change the environment, and sensible people will change their minds, Ofori-Atta said.
ken ofori atta: how can a father leave his children in hard times.
you think governance is a matter of father and child, youre appointed by the power the people have to the president. nobody is your child, if you display incompetence, you must resign.

I am not afraid to be voted against:
This maybe was the biggest! The presidents comments about voting. Like the finance minister, the president has not been spared by critics who believe Ghana is not at a good place because of some decisions by the latter.
It was during one of these periods that some residents of Manso and Kwabre in the Ashanti Region had threatened to vote the current government out if their issues about bad roads are not dealt with.
Responding to this in an OTEC FM interview in Kumasi, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo made a comment that got many people literally in stitches.
In the interview, the president stated that he is not moved by threats of electoral consequences by some supporters of the New Patriotic Party (NPP).
He explained that he knows that people will vote for their preferred candidates in an election and that voters can also not be forced to make choices in a democratic dispensation, hence there was no need to threaten a government with votes.
Their concerns were conveyed by the journalist who conducted the interview on OTEC FM.
The people of Kwabre and Manso, we know they voted massively for Nana, they have asked me to inform the president that if their roads are not fixed, they will be pained and in 2024, they will vote against the NPP, the journalist asked after the Minister of Roads and Highways, Kwasi Amoako-Attah, had responded to a question.
No problem, no problem. I am saying people make those kinds of threats, me, they dont frighten me. Somebody votes for you, somebody supports you, it is because they want you to do things for them, so I understand that, the president quickly weighed in with a response.
But if it comes to the election and you choose to vote for the NDC, that is your own issue that is not my worry because nobody holds your thumb to vote; it is your own work. The important thing is that I understand my responsibility, and we will deal with it, the president added.
I will shame you all:
Still in the Ashanti Region for his tour, the president took an opportunity while making an address to send a statement to persons he believes are his political detractors in the region.
According to him, these people will be shamed one by one by the numerous work he has done for the people of the region, which is considered the 'political world bank' of the governing party; the NPP.
President Akufo-Addo stated that for the past six years that he has been in office, the people of the Ashanti Region have benefitted enough from his government, therefore, his detractors cannot say otherwise.
""And to those of you going around saying bad things about me in the Ashanti Region, one after the other, they are all going to be shamed convincingly, today, tomorrow and the day after.
In spite of our present difficulties which I know will be gone as soon as possible, I continue to be excited about the future prospects of the nation and I urge all Ghanaians to join hands in building the Ghana that we want, we can realize it if we all work at it, he said.
This statement also got tongues wagging.
I'm not so sure if Aisha Huang was deported:
In September, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo appeared to have stirred some talk with submissions during an interview with Stone City Radio in Ho during his tour of the Volta Region.
During the interactions, he made a statement about the case of the embattled Chinese galamsey kingpin, Aisha Huang (En Huang).
Speaking in that interview, President Akufo-Addo said it is likely that the 'galamsey' queen may not have been deported, but rather fled the country in 2018.
""... I am not still sure whether she was, in fact, deported or whether she fled the country the first time and has now come back or whatever. There still seems to be some uncertainty about it.
""Whichever way it is, she has become a sort of nickname for all that the 'galamsey' represents and also, unfortunately, for the involvement of Chinese nationals in this illicit trade,"" he said.
The statement came under a lot of public scrutiny because it was determined to have contradicted what some of his appointees had said on the same subject, to the effect that Aisha Huang had actually been deported from Ghana in 2018.
I reluctantly agreed to extend the time to September 30  Ursula Owusu:
The Minister of Communications and Digitization, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, has been urging Ghanaians to re-register their SIM cards to avoid disruption of services. After several warnings, the Minister extended the August 31 deadline to September 30.
While addressing the nation on measures taken against Ghanaians who are yet to register their SIM cards said she reluctantly agreed to extend the second deadline time to September 30 upon consultations.
""Upon consultation with stakeholders in the industry and in view of the challenges enumerated above, I have reluctantly accepted to extend the re-registration exercise to September 30, 2022, she said.
Some Ghanaians criticised her for this comment. Among other things, they suggested that Ursulas use of the word hesitantly was quite unnecessary.
The part that bore me is  I have reluctantly extended the date. Is Ghana for Ursula Owusu cos eii

Ghanaians arrested for allegations they made against Akufo-Addo and his family in 2022,"The government in 2022 was heavily criticized for the arrest of persons who made some allegations against the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, and his family.
In fact, leaders of civil society organizations in Ghana and other notable Ghanaians accused the government of subtly reintroducing the abolished Criminal Libel Law, which criminalized speech.
This was after the arrests, detentions, and trials of journalists and other Ghanaians for allegedly publishing false news as well as making disparaging comments against the president and his family.
Here are some Ghanaians who were arrested for utterances they made:
ASEPA's Mensah Thompson
Mensah Thompson, Executive Director, Alliance for Social Equity and Public Accountability (ASEPA), was arrested by the Ghana Police Service for alleging that President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, together with his relatives, had used the presidential aircraft of the Ghana Armed Forces for a shopping trip to the United Kingdom in December 2021.
On January 7, Thompson posted an allegation on his Facebook wall, the first two paragraphs of which read: ""So between the 20th and 30th of December, 2021... during the Christmas, the children of a close relative of the President took Ghana's Presidential Jet the Falcon EX jet on a trip to the UK just for Christmas shopping.
""They didn't go alone, they went with their friends and partied in the sky all through the trip, taking snap videos and flaunting their lucky adventure.""
Mensah Thompson later backtracked on his claims and rendered an unqualified apology for peddling the false claims after the Ghana Armed Forces debunked the claims, discredited the reportage, and asked the general public to disregard it.
His apology could not save him from being arrested and charged with the publication of false news and offensive conduct conducive to the breach of peace. He was later granted bail of GHC 50,000.
Accra FM's Bobie Ansah
The host of the Citizen Show on Accra FM, Kwabena Bobie Ansah, was also arrested on Thursday, February 11, 2022, by the police and detained at the Nima Police Station.
In a brief statement on Friday, January 11, 2022, the Ghana Police Service said his arrest was in connection with an ""alleged case of publication of false news and offensive conduct.""
According to the police, Bobie Ansah's arrest was necessitated after he ""turned down several invitations from the police to him and others involved in the case to assist with the investigation.""
Multiple sources indicated that the arrest of Bobie Ansah was about some allegations he made against the first lady, Mrs. Rebecca Akufo-Addo.
Bobie Ansah, on live radio, accused the first lady of appropriating state lands for herself for the use of her private foundation.
""Do you know that Rebecca Akufo-Addo and Samira have appropriated for themselves the aviation lands?"" He questioned in a short video of the programme obtained by GhanaWeb.
""As I speak to you today, there are Chinese nationals working on the aviation lands that were acquired by Kwame Nkrumah for the state for the expansion of the expansion of the aviation sector for its growth. Rebecca Akufo-Addo has had the guts to apportion the state land to herself and is putting up a project in the name of her foundation  an NGO,"" he added.
Media General's Captain Smart
Broadcast journalist Godsbrain Smart, famously known as Captain Smart, was arrested two times in 2022, but only one of the arrests was related to comments he made against the president and his government.
On Wednesday, October 19, 2022, Captain Smart was arrested by officials of the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) while on his way home from work.
Before his arrest, the Ministry of Information had accused the journalist of impugning the character of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
The statement was made on the back of a broadcast made by Captain Smart on October 17, 2022, in which he accused the president of being actively involved in illegal mining, also known as galamsey.
The ministry described the claims by Captain Smart as false and malicious and further accused the journalist of engaging in unethical and irresponsible journalism.
The journalist, after his release, confirmed that he was arrested in connection with the allegation he made against the president.
A mother of four, Salamatu Mohammed
On Wednesday, November 16, Salamatu Mohammed, a mother of four, was arrested for wishing President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo dead in a viral video.
In the said viral video sighted by GhanaWeb, the woman, who was berating the president for the current economic conditions in the country, questioned why witches and ritualists from the northern parts of Ghana have not killed the president yet.
""Akufo-Addo, we are begging you in the name of God, we cannot even afford pots to cook our food. Do you want us to use your head to cook?
""Now the price of an aluminium cooking pot has increased from 6 million (GH 600) to 12 million (GH1200). Why?
""God will punish you. The witches in Ghana and the ritualist from the north can't you kill this man... I have four children; do you know the feeding fees I pay? Do you know the feeding fee, I am going to pay today... Idiot,"" she said in Twi.
The lawyer of Salamatu Mohammed, Gideon Koku Abotsi, said in an interview with GhanaWeb that his client was released by the police without being charged with any crime.
He confirmed that the police arrested Salamatu Mohammed because of the viral video, and that they (the police) said they would be investigating the matter further.

Year In Review: 5 times the police were accused of using deadly force on civilians in 2022,"The Ghana Police Service in 2022 was heavily criticized for the increase in the use of excessive force by its officers on civilians.
In fact, security experts, including the Director of the Faculty of Academic Affairs and Research at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC), Prof. Kwesi Aning, said that police officers in the country have become trigger happy and are shooting down civilians haphazardly.
This article looks at some instances in 2022 where police officers were accused of using unnecessary, brutal force on ordinary Ghanaians.
Death of Albert Donkor in Nkoranza
The Ghana Police Service in May 2022 stated that a robbery suspect, Albert Donkor, died as a result of a gunshot wound, he sustained during a police operation.
But the family of the deceased said that the claim by the police was not true because Albert Donkor was not a criminal.
The family accused the police of masterminding the killing of an innocent man, adding that Albert may have been targeted after he chanced on a robbery operation involving some police officers.
Member of Parliament for Nkoranza South Constituency, Mr. Emmanuel Kwadwo Agyekum (Hon), also said that Albert was seen alive in the custody of the police.
Narrating events leading to the death of the young man, Hon Agyekum said, ""On 25th April 2022 at exactly 1:00am-midnight, Albert Donkor was picked up from his mother's residence at Kasadjan in the Nkoranza South Municipality by the Ghana Police Service on a suspicion of a robbery that had occurred on the Nkoranza- Kintampo road.""
""He was denied access to a lawyer of his choice, his family members were denied access to him, he was never tried by any competent court, and, today, all we are hearing is - Albert is no more,"" he revealed, asking ""how reckless can the police service be?""
Killing of a protester in Nkoranza
The police also shot a mob in May protesting the killing of a robbery suspect, Albert Donkor, whom they claim was killed in the custody of the police.
The shooting of the mob killed at least one person and injured at least five others.
According to the police, six persons were injured as the police defended themselves when the protest evolved into a barbaric attack on its officers at the station and one of the injured persons died at the hospital.
On Tuesday, May 17, 2022, the Nkoranza Police Divisional and District Headquarters were invaded by some irate mob who attacked the stations with all forms of dangerous implements. The mob was allegedly protesting the death of Albert Donkor, an armed robbery suspect who died during a police anti-robbery operation.""
Police responded appropriately to the situation including bringing in reinforcement teams from the Regional Headquarters and adjoining regions to restore law and order. Also, as a result of the attack, six persons were injured and sent to the St. Theresa's Hospital, Nkoranza... one of them died while receiving treatment and five others are currently on admission and responding to treatment, portions of the police statement read.
Arise Ghana Demonstration
The police were also accused of using unnecessary force during the first day of the Arise Ghana demonstration on Tuesday, June 28, 2022.
Arise Ghana demonstrators clashed with police on Day 1 of their mass action. There was chaos as police fired tear gas at protesters while they [protesters] also pelted stones at the police. According to multiple reports, the chaos was caused by confusion over the route to take.
According to the organisers of the demonstration, a total of 93 protestors were injured during the clash with police. They indicated that injuries sustained during the protest included bone fractures and rubber bullet wounds, which led to one of the protestors going blind.
The police, however, blamed the demonstrators for the clash and arrested 29 of them. In addition, it declared the organisers of the demonstration wanted, stating that they would be arrested for their role in the incidents that happened on the first day of the protest.

The team tried to offer her two thousand Ghana cedis, but the family members rejected their offer and instead demanded justice for their daughter.
They demanded that the police produce the name of the recalcitrant officer and also ensure that he is duly sanctioned.
Gunshots at Kumasi Islamic SHS as police allegedly fire live bullets
At least 30 students of the Islamic Senior High School in the Ashanti Region of Ghana were rushed to the hospital on Monday, June 13, after police opened tear gas on them while they were demonstrating over frequent road accidents in front of the school.

One of the students said that ""the shooting incident occurred after the police had successfully sent them the demonstrating students back to the school campus, and for a reason best known to the personnel, they fired tear-gas and bullets suspected to be live ones to scare them.
We don't know what the police wanted to achieve by firing live bullets after they had successfully sent us into the school,"" a student had said.

His arrest was later determined to be in connection with comments he made against President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
Before his arrest, the Ministry of Information earlier accused the journalist of impugning the character of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
The statement was on the back of a broadcast by Captain Smart on October 17, 2022, in which he accused the president of being actively involved in illegal mining also known as galamsey activities.
Describing the claims by Captain Smart as false and malicious, the ministry further accused the journalist of engaging in unethical and irresponsible journalism.
The government in the statement said it was referring the matter to the National Media Commission for review and adjudication.
Despite the statement by government in which a threat of legal action was issued, Captain Smart in a subsequent edition of his programme reiterated his allegations against the president.

Meanwhile no official charges were pressed against the journalist.
Nana Agradaa
The founder and leader of Heavenway Champion International Ministries, Evangelist Patricia Oduro Koranteng alias Nana Agradaa was arrested by the police on October 9, 2022, and pressed with fraud charges.

Year In Review: Unprecedented parliamentary incidents in 2022,"Even though the beginning of the eighth parliament had major happenings like a hung parliament and the election of the speaker from the opposition party, among others, the year 2022 had some unprecedented incidents that got the nation talking.
GhanaWeb compiles a list of some of these happenings;
Majority calls for Dome-Kwabenya's seat to be declared vacant
On April 5, 2022, Speaker Alban Bagbin directed Adwoa Safo, Kennedy Agyapong, and Henry Quartey to the Privileges Committee.
The Speaker's directive was in line with Article 97(1)(c) of the 1992 Constitution and Order 17 of the Standing Orders of Parliament, which states emphatically that ""A Member shall not absent himself during a meeting for more than fifteen sittings without the permission in writing of the Speaker. Any member infringing this Order shall have his conduct referred to the Privileges Committee.""
The Privileges Committee produced a report after meeting the two other MPs, Ken Agyapong and Henry Quartey, and presented it to parliament.
The Privileges Committee said in their report that they could not reach Adwoa Safo; therefore, they could not come out with a decision, but the majority maintained that whether or not they heard from Adwoa Safo, the constitution stated clearly that the seat should be declared vacant, as it was automatic for it to be so.
However, when the report was brought to the house, the majority leader insisted that the committee had submitted the report to the house and the report had been laid for the information of the house and, therefore, a decision had already been determined concerning the three persons and the imperatives of Article 97 would automatically be triggered.
The majority leader added that what was captured as a motion in the order paper had issues, as the purpose of a motion is for the house to make a determination, one he considers already determined (by declaring the seat vacant).
""Mr Speaker, the privileges committee have submitted the report, and indeed, my own thinking and the incumbent of the situation is that once the committee has made a determination in respect of the three persons, then the imperative of Article 97 will automatically be triggered.
""Mr. Speaker, my thinking is that even what is captured here as a motion, the purpose of a motion is for the house to make a determination and thinking that rarely this is not for the house to make a determination.""
The Minority Leader, Haruna Iddrisu, argued that the house is governed by the 1992 constitution and the standing orders of the house.
According to him, the house should not set a precedent that a seat can be declared vacant based on recommendations of a Privileges Committee report, a precedent that could likely affect the house subsequently.
Haruna Iddrisu emphasized that if a report has been submitted to parliament, the house must take a decision.
However, the Speaker dismissed this call by the majority, stating that the report from the committee was not final but to be brought before the house for the plenary to take a decision on the matter.
The Speaker is yet to take a decision on this matter, even though Adwoa Safo officially returned to the House on November 11, 2022.
NPP MPs protesting against an appointee of their govt
On October 25, a group of New Patriotic Party (NPP) Members of Parliament petitioned President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to sack the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, and the Minister of State at the Finance Ministry, Charles Adu Boahen, to restore public confidence in the economy.
This was announced in a media briefing by their spokesperson, Andy Kwame Appiah-Kubi, Member of Parliament for Asante-Akim North.
The group said it will not partake in government business nor support the 2023 budget if the president fails to heed their calls.
According to them, the move follows previous concerns sent to the government that had not yielded any positive results.
""We have had occasions to defend allegations of conflicts of interest, lack of confidence, and trust against the leadership of the Finance Ministry.
""The recent development within the economy is of major concern to our caucus and our constituents. We have made our grave concern to our president through the parliamentary leadership and the leadership of the party without any positive response,"" Andy Appiah Kubi said.
The MPs believe the move would change the current economic situation in the country.
This action has been described as unprecedented, as many have also called on the president to take action to avoid political instability.
However, just at the time these calls were made, a video of Aremeyaw Anas' latest expose, dubbed 'Galamsey Economy' compelled President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to sack the Minister of State in Charge of Finance, Charles Adu Boahen, from office.
Charles Adu Boahen alleged on video that Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia needs just USD 200,000 as an 'appearance fee' and some positions from an investor for his siblings to get his backing and influence in establishing a business in Ghana.
A few days before the budget reading, the leadership of the New Patriotic Party called on the aggrieved members not to boycott the budget reading.
They obliged this plea and showed up in their numbers for the budget.
Joe Wise overturns major decision by Alban Bagbin again
On February 22, 2022, the First Deputy Speaker, Joseph Osei Owusu, threw out a motion by the minority for a bipartisan committee to look into the government's COVID-19 expenditure.
This is after the Speaker, Alban Bagbin, had admitted the motion before leaving his chair for the First Deputy Speaker to continue with proceedings in the chamber on the day.
It is not the first time the First Deputy Speaker has overturned a decision by the Speaker of Parliament.
Motion by Minority to probe COVID-19 expenditure
On February 22, the Minority in Parliament presented a memo to the House seeking to probe the government's expenditure on COVID-19 from 2020.
The motion, championed by three members of the minority, proposed, ""that this house constitutes a bi-partisan parliamentary committee chaired by a member of the minority caucus, to enquire into the expenditures made by the Ghana Government in relation to COVID-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020.""
Haruna Iddrisu, Minority Leader; Mohammed-Mubarak Muntaka, Minority Chief Whip; and Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson, Ranking Member on Parliament's Finance Committee, were the proposed members.
The motion was presented and read by Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson as he outlined the need for the house to probe the expenditure.
Ato Forson stated that an amount of 1.2 billion Ghana cedis was approved by parliament to support the Coronavirus alleviation program, but the government is yet to account for their expenditure, even though they exceeded the approved amount to 8.2 billion Ghana cedis.
Seconding the motion, the Member of Parliament for Asawase, Mohammed-Mubarak Muntaka, added that the health ministry, per the 2021 budget review, was only able to account for an amount of 600 million Ghana cedis.
However, before the debate could continue, Speaker Alban Bagbin requested that the Deputy First Speaker take the chair, leaving the actual debate in the hands of Joseph Osei Owusu.
After the motion was seconded, the Deputy Majority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, raised a preliminary objection to the motion.
He described the motion as baseless and urged the sit-in Speaker to reject the motion.
Making reference to Article 187 of the Constitution, he indicated that the Auditor General is the best person to investigate the matter and not any other committee.
Ruling on the motion, Joe Wise said the Speaker, Alban Bagbin, should not have admitted the motion.
""My view is that the motion ought not to have been admitted and it is improperly before the house. I so rule,"" he said.
Parliament passes 1.5% E-levy amid Minority MPs walkout
On March 29, the Minority Members of Parliament staged a walk-out before the Electronic Transfer Levy (E-Levy) Bill 2021 was passed.
The walkout occurred after the House had concluded the debate on the bill and the Speaker was to put the question on the motion for the adoption of the Finance
The Committee's report in 2.4 million, approximately eight per cent of the population, were registered as personal income taxpayers.
Prior to the walking out, the minority had complained that the  E-Levy bill consideration came as a surprise as it was not listed in Parliament's business statement for the week.
However the bill was passed after the 137 MPs of the Minority side of Parliament staged a walkout of the Chamber, on the grounds that they did not want to be associated with any further proceedings on or approval of the bill, which was being considered under a certificate of urgency.

Year In Review: Demonstrations that rocked Ghana,"2022 is undoubtedly one of the most challenging years Ghanaians have faced in terms of the performance of the country's economy.
The year saw prices of commodities increasing consistently beyond levels seen in the recent past. The country's currency also depreciated at unconscionable rates which many economists have said is the cause of the hardships in Ghana.
In addition to the economic hardships, the menace of corruption in Ghana seems to be on the increase with the country's stance on the global corruption index dropping. The Auditor General's reports and other reports cite the involvement of government officials in instances of corruption as well as allegations of top government officials being involved in illegal small-scale mining (galamsey).
To express their discontent, many Ghanaians poured out on the streets of Accra and other parts of the country to demonstrate against the government. This article takes a look at four demonstrations that rocked Ghana in 2022.
Arise Ghana Demonstration
The two-day demonstration by the pressure group, Arise Ghana, which took place from Tuesday, June 28 to Wednesday, June 29, was one of the demonstrations in 2022 that shook Ghana.
Even before the demonstration started, there was a standoff between the organisers of the demonstration and the Ghana Police Services on the modalities it should follow. The demonstration was also endorsed by leading political figures including members of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) as well as members of civil society organisations in Ghana.
Arise Ghana demonstrators clashed with police on Day 1 of their mass action. There was chaos as police fired teargas at protesters while they [protesters] also pelted stones at the police. According to multiple reports, the chaos was over confusion on the route to use.
The clash resulted from a disagreement over the route demonstrators were to use and an attempt by the protesters to march towards the presidency.
The police announced the arrest of 29 people in connection with violent incidents that marred the June 28, 2022, Arise Ghana demonstration at the Kwame Nkrumah Circle.
The Ghana Police Service even declared the organisers of the demonstration wanted, stating that they would be arrested for their role in the incidents that happened on the first day of the protest.
The police said the leaders will be held responsible for the attacks and damage to public property after the protests turned chaotic at the Kwame Nkrumah Interchange.
However, the second day of the demonstration [June 29] was incident-free and elicited commendation from the Ghana Police Service.
WeBeCitizens Demonstration against the Auditor-General
Another demonstration that made news headlines in 2022 was the WeBeCitizens demonstration against the Auditor General of Ghana. Even though the demonstration was not massive in terms of numbers, the caliber of Ghanaians who took part in it made it impactful.
Over 15 CSOs, under the umbrella name Coalition for Democratic Accountability and Inclusive Governance or Citizen Coalition, protested the failure of the AG's office to retrieve billions of funds lost to financial irregularities on state accounts.
As part of their demands, the group demanded that the AG exercise its constitutional mandate to disallow and surcharge for such irregularities.
The 2021 Auditor General's report shows that Ghana lost some GHC 17 billion in financial irregularities.
But according to the CSOs, it was incumbent on the A-G to implement measures that ensure the recovery of such funds back to the state, hence their decision to protest.
As part of their protest, the group converged at the Afua Sutherland Children's Park and moved through some of the principal streets of the national capital, through the Auditor General's office, and finally ended at Black Star Square.
Prominent members of the Coalition who joined the protest include lawyer Akoto Ampaw, lawyer Samson Ayenini, lawyer Martin Kpebu, Kofi Asare of Africa Education Watch, Nana Ama Agyemang Asante, Edem Senanu, Akwasi Pumpuni and Kofi Bentil.
NABCO trainees protest unpaid stipend
In February, scores of trainees of the Nation Builders' Corps (NABCo) programme hit the streets of Accra, demonstrating against the government's inability to offer them permanent employment.
In addition to the demand for permanent employment, the trainees will also be seeking the payment of arrears owed them, ranging from four to eight months.
The trainees who converged at the Obra Sport- Circle- were clad in red and black attire to show their frustration carrying placards with various sentiments on the abrupt end of the programme.
They moved to the Independent Square to present a petition to the Chief Executive Officer of NABCO, Dr. Ibrahim Anyars.
'Kume Preko Reloaded':
The 'Kume Preko Reloaded' demonstration, organised by renowned legal practitioner Martin Kpebu, also made waves in Ghana, mainly because of the demands of the demonstrators. The demonstration was over economic hardships in the country fueled by high inflation rates and was held on November 5, 2022.
Kpebu led hundreds of demonstrators who marched through the capital, demanding the immediate resignation of President Akufo-Addo over Ghana's current economic woes.
Addressing protesters during the march, he said: ""We are dying; citizens are dying; citizens can't afford food; citizens are starving, all because of misgovernance by President Akufo-Addo.
""It never happened that you have a president in office, and every time that the country borrows, the president's family becomes richer; how? This can't continue.
""We can't borrow all the time and have Databank becoming richer all the time. Citizens have a duty, as stated in Article 41 [of the Constitution], to ask the president to resign, and this is not the first time that a president of Ghana is going to resign,"" Martin Kpebu said.

2022 IN REVIEW: Four times Akufo-Addo made international headlines in 2022,"Captivating speeches that make international news headlines and gain applause from the global community have been a feature of the presidency of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
One of such speeches was Akufo-Addos address to Ghanaians during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, where he said, ""We knew what to do to bring the economy back to life, but not how to bring people back to life.""
2022 was no different, with the president delivering an enchanting speech at the United Nations General Assembly and an interesting interview on the BBC. But this time around, the president also made international headlines for the wrong reasons.
This article looks at four times President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo made headlines in the international media in the year.
Away! away! - Akufo-Addo booed on stage at Global Citizen Festival in Accra
One of the unfortunate incidents that happened was the booing of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo as he was delivering a speech at the Global Citizen Festival, a global entertainment event, held at the Black Star Square in Accra.
Thousands of patrons were at the venue to witness the Global Citizen Festival, which had a number of local and international artistes performing.
When it was the turn of the president to make his presentation, a section of the crowd began clapping and chanting 'away, away...""
""The whole world is in Ghana today,"" the president is heard saying in a video sighted by GhanaWeb amid the 'away, away,' chants.
The chants subsided, and the president continued with his remarks from the brightly lit stage.
Musician 'exposes' Akufo-Addo over graphic theft
President Akufo-Addo was also accused of plagiarizing excerpts of a music video of a Ghanaian musician in a tourism promotional video he shared on social media.
The allegation that the president plagiarized excerpts of the music video made international headlines, with the BBC reporting it instead of its message of encouraging people to visit Ghana.
On September 27, 2022, a video was shared on Twitter by the President of Ghana to promote tourism in the country and welcome expatriates into the country.
The video caption read, ""Beneath the deep blue sky, the Black Star is calling. Follow the stars and let them take you on a journey of our people. I invite everyone to the country at the centre of the world.""
In a tweet that highlighted the tweet, Kirani Ayat, a Ghanaian artiste, said the president had used his video without consulting him.
According to Ayat, this was after the Ministry of Tourism failed to heed his [Kirani Ayat] plea to use the song GUDA to endorse tourism in the North.
""The president of Ghana has used my video ""GUDA"" in this ad to promote Ghana. I was actively reaching out to the Ministry of Tourism in 2018/19 to use this video to push tourism in the North and got NO reply, yet today its in an ad and no one reached out to me for permission,"" he shared.
The president of Ghana has used my video GUDA in this ad to promote Ghana. I was actively reaching out to the Ministry of Tourism in 2018/19 to use this video to push tourism in the North and got NO reply, yet today its in an ad and no one reached out to me for permission. ????

Akufo-Addos interview with the BBC:
The president also caused a stir in his interview with the British broadcaster, the BBC, on its April 4, 2022 edition of its Focus on Africa programme hosted by Peter Okwoche.
There was a banter between President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and the BBCs Peter Okochwe over the health of Ghanas economy when the president granted an interview to the global broadcaster.
The conversation between the President and Okochwe covered various sectors of the Ghanaian economy and recent occurrences in the socio-political space of the country.
The president was asked about the governments recently passed Electronic Transfer (E-Levy) law, the tourism sector, and the Black Stars' qualification for the 2022 World Cup, among others.
On the economy, however, the host suggested that Ghanas economy in its current state was doing terribly with the high cost of living and increasing fuel prices, among others.
But President Akufo-Addo maintained that the situation in Ghana was not as bad and that the current state of the economy was a result of global events in which Ghana was not isolated.
Every bullet, bomb that hits a target in Ukraine hits our pockets  Akufo-Addo tells UN:
The president again did not mix words as he was addressing the United Nations General Assembly when he called out the international for not supporting African countries enough, whom he said were becoming poorer because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.
Akufo-Addo held that the war, which started in February 2022, aggravated an already precarious situation for African economies that were starting to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Akufo-Addo said the war had a direct impact on Africa, especially in the area of food supply, triggering importantly, inflation.
""Two years ago, our world came to a thundering halt, as we cowered from a health pandemic from an unknown, malicious virus, coupled with a devastating global economic pandemic. High budget deficits were no longer concerns of only developing nations.
""By 2021, COVID-19 had pushed Africa into the worst recession for half a century. A slump in productivity and revenues, increased pressures on spending and spiralling public debts confronted us without relent,"" he submitted.
On the specific case of the Russian invasion, even though Moscow insists it was a military operation, Akufo-Addo stated: ""As we grappled with these economic challenges, Russias invasion of Ukraine burst upon us, aggravating an already difficult situation.
""It is not just the dismay that we feel at seeing such deliberate devastation of cities and towns in Europe in the year 2022, we are feeling this war directly in our lives in Africa.
""Every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target in Ukraine, hits our pockets and our economies in Africa. The economic turmoil is global with inflation as the number one enemy this year,"" he added.

"45 timelines, incidents and scandals that defined Ghanas 7th Parliament","The life of Ghanas 7th
Parliament
which started on the dawn of 7th January 2017 with the swearing-in of Prof. Mike Ocquaye as Speaker, will come to an end on the 6th of January 2021 to make way for the 8th
Parliament
the day after.
This 7th
Parliament
has survived bribery and visa fraud scandals, 11 walkouts, the gunning down in cold blood of a member and death of another through illness,
COVID-19
, as well as a street clash between some members and armed men and women of the Ghana Police Service.
Two MPs were reprimanded as well for committing contemptuous acts against the 7th
Parliament
.
Here is a catalogue of 45 timelines, incidents and scandals that defined Ghanas 7th
Parliament
.
27th January 2017: The Agyarko/Ayariga Bribery Scandal
Exactly 20 days after the new MPs were sworn into office, NDC MP for Bawku Central Mahama Ayariga alleged in an interview with Radio Gold, and subsequently Joy FM, that members of the Appointments Committee had been bribed 3,000 Cedis each to approve the nomination of Boakye Agyarko as Energy Minister. He claimed Chairman of
Parliament
s Appointments Committee Joe Osei Owusu and Minority Chief Whip Muntaka Mubarak were the conduits.
The two denied the claim. NDC MP for North Tongu Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and NDC MP for Tamale North Alhassan Suhuyini publicly backed Mr. Ayarigas allegation, insisting the bribe money got to them but was subsequently returned.
Parliament
set up a committee to investigate the allegations chaired by Second Deputy Speaker of the 6th
Parliament
, Joe Ghartey.
31st March 2017: Joe Ghartey Committee reports there is no evidence of bribery in
Parliament
After almost 2 months of work, a five-member investigative committee that looked into allegations of bribery at the Appointments Committee submitted its report on the floor of parliament. The report of the committee chaired by Essikado Ketan MP Joe Ghartey concluded claims by Mahama Ayariga that MPs had been bribed to approve the nomination of Boakye Agyarko as Energy Minister were untrue.
The committee said it found no evidence to back the claim. Joe Ghartey told the house a multiplicity of rumours does not metamorphose into a fact. The committee found him guilty of contempt of parliament and recommended that he be reprimanded and made to apologize. He contested the recommendation. After a long, dragged back and forth with Speaker Mike Ocquaye on the floor, he said; if you want me to apologize, I apologize. Majority MPs rejected the apology, insisting it was not remorseful.
7th April 2017: Mahama Ayariga renders proper apology
On the floor of parliament, NDC MP Mahama Ayariga read out an apology letter he had written to the Speaker over his bribery allegation. In the letter, he apologized to then Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko, Minority Chief Whip Muntaka Mubarak and first Deputy Speaker Joe Osei Owusu, for accusing them of corruption without evidence. He also apologised to all MPs for lowering the image of the house. The Speaker told Mr. Ayariga; ""go and sin no more.""
3rd February 2017: Minority stages first walkout over Otiko Afisa Djabas appointment
The Minority in
Parliament
s first walkout was a partial one. Maybe, they were now warming up to the game. It was over the approval of former Womens Organiser of the NPP Otiko Afisa Djaba as Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection.
The Minority refused to support approval of her nomination at the Appointments Committee after she stood by comments describing former President John Mahama as wicked and evil. They also did not understand why she should serve as minister when she hadnt done her mandatory national service in the past. As parliament approved her nomination, all Minority MPs except 10 members of the appointment committee left the chamber.
The committee members stayed on to argue against her approval. A vote in the house saw 152 Majority MPs vote in favour to approve her nomination.
15th March 2017: Minority stages second walkout
The Minority in
Parliament
staged the second of what would be several walkouts as the house approved the NPP governments first budget statement delivered by Finance Minister
Ken Ofori-Atta
. The minority protested cuts to the District Assembly Common Fund and what they claimed was inefficient planned use of the countrys oil resources in the budget. The walkout was after they lost a vote on the floor that approved the budget.
26th April 2017: MPs involved in alleged visa fraud
Joy News Kojo Yankson broke the story of a confidential letter from the UK High Commissioner Jon Benjamin to Speaker of
Parliament

#TrendingGH: Coronavirus shattered our 2020 resolutions - Koforidua residents,"Correspondence from Eastern Region:
Residents in Koforidua claim most of their new year resolutions for the year 2020 got crashed by the novel coronavirus (covid-19) which broke out in the country in March 2020.
They said all the plans they had and hoped to achieve in their businesses, spiritual and personal lives as well as their academics to enhance their status in life succumbed to the coronavirus.
""For me as a business person with regard to stationery, I was expecting to get a lot more sales during the peak season which is September and October when schools reopen.
""Like I said initially, the plans were great hoping for more sales but coronavirus also had its plans. So, when it came in, the government had to shut down all schools. So there was no season for us. That has done a great deal against us as business people in the stationery business.
""We are hoping for the best. On 31st December 2020 the President will be speaking again and we are hoping schools reopen so we can make more sales. As a businessman I don't need anything better than sales, so that is we are hoping for,"" Forster Agbobafah, a stationery seller said.
Another resident, Belinda Agbesi Watson, who is a student nurse and a trader of African jewelry, expressed disappointment in 2020 saying due to the covid-19, most foreigners did not come down into the country to patronize her products.
""This year most of my plans got crashed due to the covid-19. I'm a student but for covid-19, I would have advanced in my academic level but the covid-19 has retrogressed my schooling. We are hoping that things will normalise so that I go back to school.
According to Belinda, she is praying fervently to see the coronavirus vanish from the world so that business would start booming for her.
Eric Nartey, carpenter based in Koforidua also disclosed that coronavirus erased the need for furniture in the minds of his customers since they were mostly indoors and thinking more about feeding than buying furniture.
""Business did not go on that much. At the beginning of the year, sale was good but when the disease broke, the person did not want to go out. His thoughts were all on food. What will they do with furniture? So, it made our business dwindle. It really affected us my brother,"" he told Ghanaweb.
Eric Nartey expressed hope that the coronavirus would normalise in 2021 for business to enhance so that he can make income to cater for his family and to pay taxes towards national development.
An evangelist, Isaac Anderson, also averred that the year 2020 came with a huge surprise that hampered the attainment of the year's resolutions.
He expressed confidence that 2021 would be a better year and described it as a ""packed year"" since he has deferred his stagnated 2020 resolutions to add onto those for 2021.
Some of the residents, however, expressed with joy that they were able to achieve their set target despite the Covid-19.
""I was able to achieve my target. I planned to work to get money to buy a stuffing chair. By the grace of God before the end of 2020, I have been able to sell, made the money, and bought it. For me I think everything went on well. I was able to achieve my dream. My target in 2021 is to build my house and so I pray that just as all went well for me in 2020, I can make good sales to get money for it,"" Auntie Abena, a trader who hawks with second-hand dresses told GhanaWeb.",,Regional, 31 December 2020,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/TrendingGH-Coronavirus-shattered-our-2020-resolutions-Koforidua-residents-1144616

The purpose was to outline plans for the year 2021.
The meeting was also aimed at reviewing the achievements of the house in the past year as well as ensuring the welfare of the people of GaDangbe.
It further sought to find solutions to numerous problems confronting the GaDangbe people.
Addressing Chiefs and elders, the Osu Mantse and President of the House, His Majesty Nii Okwei Kinka Dowuona VI stated that the major agenda for the year 2021 will be focusing on education.
He said most of the Chiefs are comfortable with what they have and where they find themselves and have therefore forgotten about the education of their people.
He noted that lack of education within the GaDangbe communities was part of the problems confronting the GaDangbe people and therefore called on the Chiefs to ensure education becomes their priority.
According to him, out of 275 seats in Parliament, the Ga people have only four seats. This he said is due to lack of education and boldness among the Ga people hence his call on all Ga Chiefs to take the education in their Communities seriously.
He revealed that the house agenda to straighten education will be in collaboration with the traditional areas in the Ga States to help attain the targets.
Avoidance of litigations
The President of the house Nii Okwei kinka Dowuona VI hinted that the house has started registering all titleholders in the traditional councils and digitalise some.
He said seven of the traditional areas has been registered and the remaining will be roped, this he appeals for support from well-standing and all GaDangbes in home and abroad.
COVID-19
Touching on the COVID-19 pandemic, the President revealed that the house had series of educative programs to educate the masses on the need to control the spread of the Virus.
He added that the virus was prevalent hence the need to wear face masks, regular sanitisation of hands as well as washing of hands with soap under clean running water to avoid the spread of the virus.
Pending Cases
On cases pending at the house, Nii Kinka Dowuona VI revealed that there have been 28 cases and the house have had 93 sittings and given ruling for six (6) which according to him it is a good sign that conflicts are been revolved
The President also thanked the chiefs for their cooperation and without them, nothing could be achieved.
Capacity building
He said the Ga state before 2012 had only one Paramountcy and a traditional council but currently the state has six Paramountcies, traditional council's and Municipalities.
Nii Okwei called on colleague Chiefs to wake up and ensure that the people within their traditional areas benefit from the establishment of government institutions in their localities.
He said the house will collaborate with resource persons to educate and build capacity of Chiefs to enable them utilise the expertise of staff of the various municipalities to the benefit their people.", Faisal Mustapha,Regional, 31 December 2020,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Greater-Accra-House-of-Chiefs-hold-End-of-Year-Meeting-Outline-plans-for-2021-1144406
Top government officials who lost their jobs in 2020,"Coronavirus
brought serious complications, and with it came not only many deaths, but the loss of jobs.
The impact of the pandemic of the lives of many was immeasurable but others had their lots for other reasons; some self-inflicted, and others, inevitable.
Such was the case for some government officials whose appointments were terminated for various reasons.
GhanaWeb compiled a few of these and outlines them in this piece:
PPA Boss  Agyenim Boateng Adjei:
It was hit after hit from all sides and angles after the then boss of the Public Procurement Authority (PPA), Agyenim Boateng Adjei was found culpable by the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) of conflicting his personal interests with the performance of his functions.
His woes began after he was exposed in an investigative piece by journalist, Manasseh Azure Awuni, as having sold government contracts to a company he was affiliated to; Talent Discovery Ltd. Which he established.
The expose titled; Contracts for sale led to the dismissal of Mr Adjenim Boateng Adjei. First, he was suspended in 2019. Then his contract as PPA Boss was terminated by the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, after CHRAJ found him culpable after investigations in October 2020. He was then banned from holding any public office for the next five years.
As though that was not enough, the Ghana Institute of Procurement and Supply, which he belonged to, also suspended him as a member, over what they said was a breach of Article 13 of GIPS Code of Ethics pertinent to conflicts of interest.
Mr Adjei tried fighting back and threatened to sue CHRAJ after the ban, noting that there was nothing incriminating in their report.
Deputy Communications Minister -
Vincent Sowah Odotei
:
His ministerial appointment was revoked in the middle of the year, on April 6, 2020.
Very little information was given about the reason behind the decision which came from the presidency but the announcement was contained in a statement signed by Director of Communications, Eugene Arhin.
It indicated that Mr Sowah Odotei will have his position as Deputy Communications Minister occupied by former Deputy Health Minister, Alexander Kodwo Kom Abban who is also MP for Gomoa West.
Carlos Kingsley Ahenkorah:
Carlos Kingsley Ahenkorah resigned from office as Deputy Minister for Trade and Industry on July 3, hours after he admitted in an interview that he visited some voters registration centres in his constituency despite knowing he has tested positive for
Coronavirus
.
Despite his knowledge of his COVID-19 status, the lawmaker made an appearance at his constituency and was massively criticized for it.
He, however, mounted a spirited defence for his action, while insisting he did not err because he was cautious during his stay at the registration centres. This didnt go well with a section of the public with many calling for his resignation.
They could not fathom why a public official would violate preventive protocols and refuse to accept his wrong. Prior to that, reports were rife the President had given Ahenkorah an ultimatum to resign or be fired.",,General, 31 December 2020,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Top-government-officials-who-lost-their-jobs-in-2020-1144376

Events that shocked the nation in 2020,"The year 2020 has been one that came with many shocking occurrences that took the nation by surprise.
From the death of high-profile personalities, the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic and now a hung
Parliament
of Ghanas legislators in the upcoming year.
Despite these unforeseen occurrences, the country is looking forward on a path to recovery on all fronts over what could be described as a rather shocking year for many.
First case of
COVID-19

News of the novel coronavirus outbreak first emerged in the Chinese capital of Wuhan in the Hubei province.
Described as the novel coronavirus (
COVID-19
) the pandemic began to spread through China and then around world with infections and deaths posing as a major public health crisis and governance concerns.
Ghana's Health Ministry confirmed the first two cases of the coronavirus (
COVID-19
) on Thursday, March 12, 2020.
According to authorities, the cases were recorded after two individuals had returned to Ghana from Norway and Turkey.
Health authorities then began a contract tracing and isolation regime in a bid to curtail the spread of the virus.
President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
subsequently announced partial lockdowns and border closures to also curb the spread of the virus.
The pandemic, however, resulted in some 54,401 confirmed cases for Ghana as of December 23, 2020, with the loss of lives of over 300 persons which have included some high-profile personalities.
Death of Former President Rawlings
The death of the former president sent the nation of Ghana into a sudden state of shock in November 2020.
The news of his demise broke out in the early hours of Thursday, November 12, 2020, with sources indicating he passed away at the Cardiothoracic Centre of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.
Known for his charisma, leadership and a beacon of shaping Ghanas democracy, the former president of Ghana did not shy away from speaking about his ideologies whenever he got the chance.
Jerry Rawlings made great strides on both the international and domestic front for Ghana. His legacy however will remain a topic of controversy and respect for many.
Meanwhile, President

A hung
Parliament
after 2020 Elections
Following the outcome of the December 7 general elections, the Electoral Commission announced the certified
Parliament
ary results of the 275 constituencies.
The ruling New Patriotic Party has won 138 seats in
Parliament
with an independent candidate leaning towards the party while the National Democratic Congress has won 137 seats.
The opposition NDC won the last remaining seat in the Sene West Constituency which was still in contention after presidential results were declared on December 9, 2020, by the Electoral Commission.
The win now meant the NDC has matched the ruling NPPs tally and in turn creating a hung parliament. The ruling NPPs mandate will now be reduced from a 62.7 percent majority in
Parliament
, with seats almost evenly shared between the two main political parties.
A hung
Parliament
which was has never been witnessed in Ghanas democracy still remains a shock to many as fears of a complicated rule of President-elect Akufo-Addo trickle in.
The move poses a threat to his efforts to act decisively in restoring an economy impacted from the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic with a very slim majority in

Top leaks of 2020 that shook the country,"The media in Ghana is among the most vibrant in Africa and leaked tapes, videos, and documents are significant contributors to this vibrancy.
The leaks that hit the public in 2020, just like for other years, were alleged scandals of influential people and heads of public institutions.
Viral sex tapes of popular persons are a key part of leaks every year, and this year the victim was a popular musician and businessman.
Also, some of the alleged scandals in 2020 were later denied by the principal actors amid threats of legal action for defamation after the alleged scandal has grabbed news headlines or made waves on social media.
Below is GhanaWebs compilation of top leaks that caused a major stir in Ghana in the year the pandemic wreaked havoc across the globe.
Nana Akufo-Addos alleged bribery video
A video showing President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
allegedly taking a bribe in his office was leaked in the lead up to the December 7 general elections in a bid to decimate the Presidents reputation.
The real motive notwithstanding, the investigative video by Salis Newspaper forced a public discussion about the reputation of Nana Akufo-Addo.
In the said video, Urban Roads Director, Alhaji Abass Awolu, according to a narrator, sent a delegation to the President in his private residence in Nima.
They were led to the president by Ghanas Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Adjei Bawuah. In his company were a woman and a man who was introduced as wife and brother of the Director of Urban Roads, the narrator said.
In the secret recording, the voice purported to be that of the man introduced as the brother of Alhaji Abass, is heard pleading with the President to turn a deaf ear to some allegations against Alhaji Abass, stressing it was a plot by detractors who are bent on tarnishing Alhaji Abass's image and eventually see him kicked out of office.
Akufo-Addo after the supposed plea is seen receiving a hefty brown envelope from Ambassador Bawuah which according to the narrator contained $40,000 being presented on behalf of Alhaji Abass.
A second video of the same event that was also leaked, however, rubbished the claims in the Salis video as false.
Although the scenes and personalities in both videos are the same, the conversation was entirely different.
The second video sought to suggest that it was a donation and not a bribe.
The unseen man, who was also the man secretly filming the video, was rather heard discussing how they [Alhaji Abass's family] could assist in 2016 electioneering campaign that brought Akufo-Addo to power.
The Presidents party, the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), said the video was doctored and leaked to paint their presidential candidate in a bad light before the 2020 election.
D-Blacks sex tape
D-Black was hit by a sex tape scandal in September after a leaked video of him performing various sex acts on a lady went viral.
Some said it appears D-Black knew he was being filmed as he looked directly into the camera at some point.
Later on, the lady seen with D-Black in the video, Adrienne Nicole Edwards, said in a video published on Instagram that she was surprised about the leak.
She revealed she was working with the authorities both in the US and in Ghana to resolve the leak.
It remains a mystery how the video leaked.
GH52.5 billion transfers to ghost accounts
In the latter part of November, a leaked audit conducted by the Ghana Audit Service purported to show that there were transfer of tax receipts of GH52.5 billion by GCB Bank to unknown sources.
However, to quell public suspicion that the billions had gone missing, the Audit Service released a statement on December 1, 2020, to clarify the leaked document.
Whilst we appreciate the publics interest in this audit, we wish to place on record that the audit in reference, is a special audit exercise which was requested by the Honorable Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta in a letter dated 15th August, 2020, based on the mandate of the President under Article 187 (8), the Service said.
According to the Service, the request included the confirmation of the transfer receipts from the various transit accounts maintained by commercial banks into the respective BoG Holding Accounts from 2015 to date.
Felix Ofosu-Kwakyes side chick
On Monday, November 2, 2020, a video popped up on social media showing Felix Kwakye Ofosu, parliamentary candidate for Abura Asebu Kwamankese in the Central Region, in a room with a woman said to have been engaged to another man.
In the viral video, the staunch National Democratic Congress (NDC) member, was being accosted by relatives of the man the lady was allegedly engaged to.
The returned bribe
Investigative journalist, Manasseh Azure Awuni, in November produced an expose on a longstanding tussle between the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) and Centre of Awareness (COA-FS).
Titled The Returned Bribe, Manasseh interviewed the Executive President of COA FS Global Peace Mission, Prof. Samuel Ato Duncan on what exactly is the reason his widely praised herbal food supplement is failing to get FDA approval.
Ato Duncan then revealed he was asked to pay some money to grease the palms of some big shots at the FDA.
After doing so, he got a surprise call that the bribe money was too small for that reason it would be returned.
Dr Duncans exchanges with the official of the FDA about plans to return the bribe was caught on an audio tape.
The FDA later denied the allegation of taking a bribe from COA FS.
Mzbel and Tracey Boakyes Papa no conversation
A leaked audio of a conversation between actress Tracey Boakye and popular former musician Mzbel ended the controversy about the true identity of the papa no.
Before the leaked audio, there were speculations that the papa no was former President
John Dramani Mahama
. But it was just a rumour at the time.
In the audio, Tracey Boakye could be heard accusing MzBel of tarnishing her image to John Mahama.
She stressed that MzBel has been taking screenshots of her Instagram post only to edit it with bad caption and send to the papa no.
That leaked audio settled the saga of the papa no, which is Twi for the man.
A hug from you will put me to sleep
In January this year, a video of the National Security Minister, Albert Kan Dapaah, in a bedroom conversation with a lady who sources allege is his girlfriend leaked online.
In the video, the Minister who is supposed to be conscious of his security is clearly taken off-guard and being ordered around while in the said video conversation to show the make of his pyjamas.
He was seen displaying his pyjamas which he claims is classy and a depiction of his taste for good things.
There was never a reaction from the Minister or government.",,General, 30 December 2020,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Top-leaks-of-2020-that-shook-the-country-1143764
Media transfers of 2020 that shook the industry,"The competition in the Ghanaian media space is gradually becoming intense like what we see in the sporting fraternity particularly football when the transfer window is open.

This quotation was coined during the surge in COVID-19 cases globally. With the sharp increase of persons affected by the global pandemic and the number of persons who had died at the time, Ghanaians were of the view that there would be no one left on the earth by June.
Fellow Ghanaians
Anywhere you hear of fellow Ghanaians, the first person that comes to mind is President Akufo-Addo. This is because the President-elect makes use of these words in his introductory message to Ghanaians anytime hes about updating the country on measures taken by the government in the fight against the deadly coronavirus.
Fellow Ghanaians, I have come to your homes again..., he commences his message with.
This too shall pass
In troubling times, most people look forward to sailing through the storm to become victorious. As some look to God by way of motivation, others get their inspiration from other means.
President Akufo-Addo, amidst the increase in coronavirus cases both locally and internationally, is optimistic the pandemic will be swept off the country.
In almost all his address to the nation, he concludes by saying this 'too shall pass.' This is a way to encourage Ghanaians not to give up in the fight against the coronavirus.
Akufo-Addo is the mother serpent of corruption
""Akufo-Addo is the mother serpent of corruption"" quote was used by the former Special Prosecutor, Martin Amidu.
Reacting to some allegations levelled against him by the Presidency, the anti-corruption campaigner described President Akufo-Addo as the kingpin of corruption.
This wild accusation came after he conducted an audit into the governments controversial Agyapa Royalties deal.
In a 27-page response to allegations levelled against him from the presidency, Mr. Amidu wrote ...It was divinely revealed to me that the President whom I trusted so much for integrity only looked like the innocent flower of anti-corruption but he was really the mother corruption serpent under the innocent-looking flower
Mahama Afa
Before the 2020 general elections, the opposition
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) came up with so many tag lines for their campaign but the one that stood tall amongst all was 'Mahama Afa', to wit Mahama has won the elections. Unfortunately, they lost the elections.

This gained attention after wrongly pronouncing the word.
Akyem Mafia
This term was mostly used by the opposition
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) anytime they wanted to speak on an issue concerning the governing New Patriotic Party.
Aside from describing the NPP as running a family and friends government, they tagged the leader of NPP, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo as an Akyem mafia.
This was widely used after the special prosecutor, Martin Amidu identified some anomalies in the controversial Agyapa Royalties deal.

Top crimes unresolved in 2020,"They say the wheels of justice grind slowly, but if you are a crime victim or a relation of a victim seeking justice, then that saying will either seem like an eternity or it will make little to no sense until justice is finally done.
This has been the narrative of some crimes which have remained unsolved and are still under investigation by the countrys security apparatus.
Ghanaweb highlights some criminal cases which have not been solved all year round in 2020.
Murder of Sogakope assemblyman
Residents of Sogakope in the Volta Region were awoken with news of the gruesome murder of assemblyman of the area, Mawutor Adzahli on March 1, this year.
According to reports, the victim and family were attacked by armed robbers who shot and killed him after a scuffle ensued between him and his assailants.
Initial accounts suggested that his death was as a result of a contract killing, but further investigations by the Criminal Investigations Department revealed that his assailants were armed robbers who had gone there to raid his home.
The Police, as well as former President JJ Rawlings, placed bounties on the heads of the assailants to help accost the gang members.
In August, the Police disclosed that they had arrested the alleged ring leader of the killers of Mr Mawutor Adzahli, bringing to a total of seven suspects remanded.
Richard Adikyere, 23, a mason and the leader of the gang; Stephen Adzibolo also known as (aka) Tseko, 29, mechanic; Emmanuel Hedzro, 25, motor rider; Kofi Zotorvi, Christian Zotorvi, 30, farmer; Micheal Sam, 29 and Obed Agornu, 21, are in the custody of the police.
Despite the arrests, the court is yet to pronounce judgment on the killers of the assemblyman.
Murder of Prof Benneh
Senior Lecturer at the University of Ghana Law Faculty, Professor Emmanuel Yaw Benneh was on the morning of Saturday, September 12, found dead in his Adjiringanor house in Accra under circumstances suspected to be murder.
After intense investigations, four suspects who were initially arrested and charged with murder were discharged by the court after no incriminating evidence was found against them.
The prime suspect, however, a cleaner in the house of the victim later gave a chilling account in court about his involvement in the killing of the law professor.
Weeks after confessing his involvement in the murder of Prof Benneh, lead suspect, James Nana Womba reportedly died at the Police Hospital in Accra following a short ailment on October 19, 2020.
The development has since thrown the investigations into limbo.
Murder of Mfantseman MP
On Friday, October 9, Member of Parliament for the Mfantseman constituency, Ekow Quansah Hayford was shot and killed by armed robbers while he journeyed back after embarking on a political campaign.
The incident happened at dawn on the Abeadze Dominase - Abeadze Duadzi - Mankessim Road in the Central Region.
The Ghana Police Service announced after about a week that they had arrested five suspects in connection to the killing of the lawmaker.
Further manhunt and investigations have led to the arrest of the ringleader of the suspects responsible for the death of Mr Quansah Hayford.
So far, eight persons have been apprehended in connection to the crime.
In a recent development, the prosecutor handling the case revealed that police have begun an examination of forensic evidence gathered at the scene of the crime.
Assault of Nii Lante Vanderpuye
Member of Parliament for the Odododiodio constituency, Nii Lantey Vanderpuye was reportedly assaulted by security operatives on his way to secure bail for a reporter who was working for him.
According to Mr Vandepuye when he arrived at the James Town Police Station, 12 persons from the National Security, some of whom wielded guns approached him and hit him in the chest.
They asked him to leave the area and proceeded to land slaps and punches on his face.
Mr Vanderpuye said it took the intervention of the police to stop the operatives from further assaulting him.
Despite his report, however, no action was taken as we did not see the end of the matter.
Lynching of Madam Akua Denteh
Residents of Mempeasem in the East Gonja Municipality in the Savannah Region were thrown into a state of shock on Thursday, July 23, when a 90-year-old woman was whipped and lynched to death after she was accused of being a witch.
The incident generated a nationwide furore, leading to security agencies mounting a manhunt for persons who were responsible for the murder.
Seven suspects were picked up for their roles in the lynching of the 90-year-old victim identified as Akua Denteh.
In October, hearing and prosecution of the suspects in court failed to come off due to the non-appearance of their counsel. The hearing was duly adjourned but is yet to be concluded.
Western Togoland separatists
Their brazen attacks on state-owned institutions and attempts to declare parts of the Volta Region as an independent state was squarely tackled by security agencies to restore calm and order.
Over 60 persons identified as members of the Western Togoland separatists have since been arrested with prosecution pending while investigations continue.
Hawa Koomson shooting incident
Minister of Special Initiatives, Mavis Hawa Koomson came under scrutiny after admitting to opening fire at her constituency during a voters registration exercise early this year.
The Minister who doubles as Member of Parliament for the Ewutu Senya Constituency reportedly fired a gun in July to protect herself.
Despite several calls by CSOs and Ghanaians stakeholders for her to be brought to book for endangering the lives of the citizenry, 5 months down the line, investigations have not given much to write home about.
There were also complaints of colleague MPs on the Minority side of the divide who claimed she was been protected by the incumbent government.
Kumasi Central market fire
Over 70 shops at the Kumasi Central market were razed down when fire gutted the place in the early hours of Sunday, October 18.
The items, worth over 100million Ghana Cedis were destroyed around the Dr Mensah area known as French line.
Although preliminary investigations suggested that the fire was caused by electrical faults, Police noted that they will delve deeper into the matter as the incident was the second in the same area in 3 months.
Kaneshie, Kantamanto market fires
Portions of the Kaneshie market in Accra were gutted under bizarre circumstances with several traders losing properties and means of livelihoods.
The incident formed part of a recent surge in fire outbreaks at market places across the country. Although investigations are ongoing, it remains to be seen what the actual cause of the fires is.",,General, 30 December 2020,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Top-crimes-unresolved-in-2020-1143656
Rambo of 2020 - High-profile 'fights' and 'fighters' of the year,"Everything but unexciting was 2020. A year full of unexpected happenings; tragedies, pandemic, drama and all. It certainly left a lot of memories with Ghanaians and indeed the world over. But of course, it didnt end without a fight; literally!
There were a few occasions where some personalities stirred up talk with their actions and utterances. In different settings and under different circumstances but they did happen and caught the attention of newsmakers and in some instances social media users.
GhanaWeb brings you a flashback of a few of these in this piece:
Mavis Hawa Koomson
:
She gained the title Rambo Minister after news of her gunfire incident broke out during the Electoral Commissions voters registration exercise.
Mavis Hawa Koomson
, Member of Parliament for the Awutu Senya East constituency fired a gun at a voters registration centre in her constituency after she heard her opponent had bussed people from other places to the registration centre.
In her defense, she claimed to have done that to protect herself considering her police escorts were not working at the time she left for the place and she didnt feel safe.
Charles Bissue and George Mireku Duker:
It was an unexpected physical fight between two prominent persons; a Member of Parliament and a presidential staffer.
Tarkwa-Nsuaem MP, George Mireku Duker and Charles Bissue exchanged blows after the former raised concerns about how the latter was supporting an independent candidate in the constituency ahead of the December 7 polls.
This happened during a workshop in the Western Region in November, where the two were present. The situation resulted in a swollen face for Mr Bissue and a bitten finger with deep cuts for Mireku Duker who later apologized.
The two have since smoked the peace pipe after the intervention of some party leaders.
Ayisi Boateng and Alhaji Saani Mohammed:
Ghanas High Commissioner to South Africa, Ayisi Boateng, clashed with his 40-year-old good friend and a founding member of the opposition
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) in the Ashanti Region, Alhaji Saani Mohammed.
The two nearly engaged in fisticuffs on Monday, December 14 when they appeared on the GhanAkoma morning show on Akoma FM to do a review of the December 7 polls.
The High Commissioner had suggested that people who decide to make truth and justice secondary in their lives because of their individual inclinations to their tribe and political parties have had useless education. He said this after Mr Mohammed had described the Electoral Commission as liars and fraudsters for declaring the elections for the NPP.
Mr Ayisi Boatengs comments obviously didnt go well with his friend who got vexed by his response and this generated into verbal exchanges and a near-brawl but for the intervention of the host of the show.
Nii Lante Bannerman and Nii Lante Vanderpauye:
This may not have been direct, but it got bloody and happened under the watch of both parliamentary candidates for the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) and the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC). It was supposed to be a health walk led by Member of Parliament of the area, Edward Nii Lante Vanderpuije.
Though both parties had planned for their floats in the constituency on the same day; October 24, 2020, the health walk which began earlier turned chaotic when some members of the NPP clashed with some members of the NDC during their walk.
There were pelting of stones and bottles and a number of people were injured. The NPP candidate Nii Lante Bannerman accused the incumbent of inciting the youth to cause chaos in the constituency but many including sports personality and popular boxer, Bukom Banku believes the youth were incited by both leaders to act in the manner they did and therefore called for the arrest of both of them.
Kennedy Agyapong:
He is vociferous, that is undisputed and he speaks his mind on whatever issues he deems fit. So he did on several issues in 2020 like previous years, and this time, it involved a Judge of the High Court.
He described as stupid, a decision by a judge to grant an injunction against him without conducting any due diligence.
He threatened to deal with him and this attracted a charge of contempt and he was subsequently arraigned before court.
Mzbel and Tracy Boakye
They came at each other, hard and were at it for a long while. A series of videos released by both parties had them accusing and making several allegations.
Tracy even at a point advised her fans to refrain from gaining wealth by sleeping with people. Hard work she said was the way out.
And then out of nowhere, the papa no controversy emerged. It is unclear what started the banter between Tracy Boakye and Mzbel, but the two kept dissing each other and revealing secretes in a live video with Tracey Boakye claiming Mzbel couldnt get much from the sugar daddy they are both chasing, unlike her that got a house and many other things. She bragged among other things that she has asked the sugar daddy not to give Mzbel any more gifts.
Mzbel also replied with a video teasing and laughing at the actress that she uses blackmail and fights to take things from the said man and that for someone sleeping with a married man, she should not be bragging about it the way she is on social media.",,General, 28 December 2020,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Rambo-of-2020-High-profile-fights-and-fighters-of-the-year-1142315
