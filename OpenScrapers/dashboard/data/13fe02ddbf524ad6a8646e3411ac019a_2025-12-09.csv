Increasing human rights abuse and criminalisation of speech under present regime worrying - Dr Zaato,"Political analyst Dr George Jebuntie Zaato has expressed concern over the recent increasing spate of arrests of citizens by state investigative institutions under the new Mahama administration.
Since the assumption of the second Mahama administration, EOCO and the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) have been in the news over the detention of several members of the erstwhile government and for demanding bail conditions, which have been roundly condemned.
The latest was the surprise detention of Lawyer Martin Kpebu last week by the OSP, and a demand for landed property as a condition for his bail.
Speaking on the issue on TV3's Big Issues yesterday, Dr Zaato condemned the arrest of Martin Kpebu and expressed worry over the abuse of the rights of citizens under a government which is claiming to be more democratic than the previous government, which he said did not abuse the rights of citizens for speaking their mind.
""Martin Kpebu said worse things about Akufo-Addo and Bawumia but he was never arrested. Nobody touched him,"" Dr. Zaato said.
""Then all of a sudden under a so-called liberalised regime, under the so-called new freedom  we are told that the Akufo-Addo regime was repressive and we are told that we are in a second independence  and under the new liberalised regime, Martin Kpebu cannot express his mind without the state arresting him.""
Martin Kpebu detained by OSP
Dr Zaato said Kissi Agyebeng, like those in charge of EOCO who have also been abusing the rights of citizens, were state officers acting in the name of the state under the present regime.
""Kissi Agyebeng was not acting in his personal capacity. He was acting as an agent of the state.""
""What the OSP is doing is not different from what EOCO has done. They have all done that. How do you take somebody in and then you say landed property? Where is Martin Kpebu going? I'm not a lawyer but I'm just asking, where is Martin Kpebu going?""
Dr Zaato added that if without the new cyber security law, which the Mahama government has proposed, the likes of Martin Kpebu and Paul Adom-Otchere could be arrested and their rights abused, he wondered what would be the fate of citizens and their rights to free speech if the cyber security law, which has been condemned as seeking to restrict free speech, is passed.
""My point is that both Martin and Paul are victims of a state that is increasingly criminalising speech. And all this is happening before the new cyber law or whatever is yet to come. Imagine for a minute if that law passes.""

Is OSP's office unconstitutional? - Kofi Bentil weighs in,"The Vice President of Imani Africa, Kofi Bentil, has stated that the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) is not unconstitutional.
Speaking on TV3's Keypoints on Saturday, December 6, 2025, he emphasised that although it is not unconstitutional, its powers are limited.
The Office of Special Prosecutor has no constitutional basis' - Speaker Bagbin
The OSP is not unconstitutional. It is specific for anti-corruption issues and related matters. They are given some police powers, not plenary powers. They didnt have any jurisdiction to arrest Martin Kpebu. Absolutely zero.
It is Martins right as a citizen to say whatever he wants to say to anybody, without due respect from President Mahama down to any public office holder. If offended, sue him for defamation, Bentil said.
He recalled the historical context of the OSPs creation.
It really got into gear around President Kufuors time We got the search charge and disallowance, we got RTI, we got all kinds of things done. But the Attorney General had consistently failed for almost a century,"" he noted.
On the recent invitation of private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu, Bentil said he was only invited voluntarily to provide information.
He has no charge. He is invited to assist the OSP in the investigation. No man has a responsibility to assist the state institution, but if you want to help, fine. That is voluntary,"" he remarked.

Fearmongers Online: Stop or we will come after you - Muntaka tells citizens,"Individuals who use online platforms to spread fear and panic have been warned by the Minister of Interior, Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak, that security agencies now have the tools to track and apprehend them.
He issued the caution on December 5, 2025, in Ho, during the inauguration of the Volta Regional Command of the National Signals Bureau (NSB), where he joined President John Dramani Mahama to commission the new facility.
Highlighting the expanded regional presence of the NSB, Muntaka said it had strengthened national security operations.
Interior minister condemns attacks on security personnel, urges professional conduct
He noted that following the opening of the Eastern Regional Office in Koforidua in September, additional offices in Sunyani and Techiman are set to serve the Bono and Bono East regions. By the end of the year, four more regional commands are expected to be operational, bringing intelligence support closer to local communities and enhancing coordination among security agencies.
The new Volta Regional Command is equipped with advanced surveillance systems, analytical tools, and real-time data equipment. The facility will act as a hub for intelligence gathering and speed up security responses across the region.
Muntaka called on the Ghana Police Service, Ghana National Fire Service, Ghana Immigration Service, and Ghana Prisons Service to collaborate closely with the NSB, emphasising that security challenges cannot be handled by a single agency.
To our citizens who use technology online and other means to create panic and fear, the time for you to stop is here. And I can assure you, we will come after you. You will have to stop or we will come after you. Now we have what it takes to track you, to observe what you are doing, to trace you wherever you are hiding, he said.
He reassured the public that the upgraded systems are not meant to intrude on private lives.
This facility is not to spy on you. It is to make sure every citizen goes about his or her duty without watching his or her back, he stated.

What did Nana Konadu do to deserve this 'low-class' funeral?  Adomako Baafi asks,"Former Communications Director of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Yaw Adomako Baafi, has accused the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) of failing to honour the late former First Lady,
Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings
properly, despite her significant contributions to the party founded by her husband, the late former President Jerry John Rawlings.
Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings
, wife of the late former President Rawlings, was given a state burial on November 28, 2025.
However, speaking in an interview on Movement TV on December 5, 2025, Adomako Baafi criticised what he described as a low-class funeral held for the late former First Lady.
According to him, the publicity surrounding the funeral was so minimal that many Ghanaians were still unaware that she had been buried.
See Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings funeral. Till date, people dont even know that she is dead and has been buried. What the NDC has done to the woman is painful. If there is life after death she would think twice. They didnt even do posters for the funeral, he lamented.
He further compared the situation to preparations for the burial of highlife legend Daddy Lumba, noting the number of posters and billboards already circulating even before his funeral.
Look at Lumba, his funeral is not even up yet but look at the number of posters and billboards in town. But
Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings
did not get that publicity.
Adomako Baafi also contrasted her funeral with that of her late husband, which he said received massive support from the state during the tenure of former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
Compare her funeral to that of her late husband when Akufo-Addo was President, the kind of honour they gave him. So, what wrong did she do? If nothing at all, the Greater Accra NDC could have mobilised members to attend. The low-class funeral they did for her was painful. So wicked. Even her own child is part of the NDC.
Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings
makes final journey home
Ghana on Friday, November 28, 2025, laid to rest one of its illustrious daughters,
Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings
, the countrys longest-serving First Lady.
Despite the solemn atmosphere at the State Funeral held at Independence Square in Accra, there were moments of humour that briefly lifted the spirits of mourners.

'Wontumi is financially struggling; MTN even reverses MoMo sent to him'  Yandoh alleges,"The
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) Ashanti Regional Communications Director, Paul Kwabena Yandoh, has alleged that the Ashanti Regional Chairman of the NPP, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, popularly known as Chairman Wontumi, is facing severe hardships due to his ongoing trial with the state.
According to Paul Yandoh, Chairman Wontumis mobile money (MoMo) number has been blocked by the government as part of actions linked to his trial.
He explained that Wontumis financial situation has become extremely challenging, alleging that the chairman is currently suffering financially.
Yandoh further claimed that he has personally attempted to assist Wontumi through mobile money transfers.
However, anytime money is sent, the service provider, MTN, allegedly reverses the funds back into his account a situation he described as worrying.
Speaking on Kumasi-based Ezra FM, in an interview that has since been shared on social media, he stated, When you send the money, MTN sends it back. His account has been frozen and MTN will tell you not to send money into that account.
So, Wontumi has been deprived a lot. Now, if he will talk, its only through WhatsApp. They even want to take his number from him.
Meanwhile, Chairman Wontumi is currently being prosecuted by the state for allegedly engaging in illegal mining (galamsey) activities.
In the first case, the state has charged the Ashanti Regional Chairman, his company Akonta Mining Limited, and the companys director, Kwame Antwi, with six criminal offences.
'Trial yet to commence' - Wontumis lawyer dismisses claims of 15-year jail sentence
The charge sheet indicates that Wontumi and the other accused persons face three counts of assigning mineral rights without the necessary approval and three counts of facilitating an unlicensed mining operation.
In the second case, Wontumi and four other accused persons Edward Akuoko, Owusu Bempah, and Kwame Antwi (Director of Akonta Mining Limited, who is currently at large) have been charged with seven criminal offences related to alleged illegal mining activities in the Tano Nimri Forest Reserve.
The state has since dropped charges against Edward Akuoko after he agreed to serve as a prosecution witness.

"Haruna, Ablakwa in serious 'fight' over NDC 2028 running mate slot  Adom-Otchere alleges","Former Board Chairman of the Ghana Airports Company Limited (GACL) and host of Good Evening Ghana, Paul Adom-Otchere, has alleged an ongoing rift between the Minister of Education,
Haruna Iddrisu
and the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa
.
According to him, the tension stems from internal competition for the 2028
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) vice-presidential slot.
Speaking on his Good Evening Ghana programme on December 3, 2025, Adom-Otchere said both ministers have recently taken contradictory public positions on the debate over student hairstyle regulations an issue he claims reflects deeper political rivalry rather than mere policy differences.
Adom-Otchere said Ablakwas recent public disagreement with
Haruna Iddrisu
over students hairstyle in Senior High Schools breached government communication discipline, adding that such contradictions between cabinet members should not occur.
The broadcaster asserted that the real source of tension is the race to become the NDCs running mate in the 2028 general election.
The tussle for VP in NDC. That's what they are fighting about. That is the fight. Both of them want to be the next Vice President if the NDC were to win 2028. And both of them want to be Vice President for the same presidential candidates, he said.
He claimed that both ministers aspire to partner the current Vice President, Prof Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, should the party choose her as its presidential candidate in 2028.
Adom-Otchere explained that Ablakwa enjoys a longstanding political relationship with Prof Opoku-Agyemang dating back to her days as Minister for Education under the then former President John Dramani Mahama, where Ablakwa served as her deputy.
Haruna Iddrisu
, on the other hand, is said to be positioning himself based on his own political stature and influence within the party.
He further suggested that leading NDC figures including former National Chairman Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo and former Health Minister Alex Segbefia are key actors in the partys internal alignment in favour of Prof Opoku-Agyemang.
According to Adom-Otchere, the Vice Presidents camp sees Ablakwa as a strong bridge to the Volta Region, a strategic electoral bloc in NDC politics.
He argued that, both Iddrisu and Ablakwa have begun positioning themselves early for the 2028 contest.

'Mahama appointing Lordina as EC chair would be better than Jean Mensa'  NPP's Masawudu,"The competence of
Electoral Commission
Chairperson Jean Mensa and her deputies have been downplayed by the Third National Vice Chairman of the opposition
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Osman Masawudu.
Speaking on Top TV, Masawudu said he would prefer a scenario in which the NDC administration led by President
John Dramani Mahama
appoints his wife, Lordina Mahama, as EC Chairperson, rather than have Jean Mensa and her deputies remain in office.
He also took aim at the Special Prosecutor, Kissi Agyebeng, saying if there were a term stronger than incompetence, it should be used to describe him.
Presidency forwards petitions for removal of EC Chair, Deputies & Special Prosecutor to Chief Justice
If
John Dramani Mahama
appoints his wife Lordina Mahama as the next EC boss in Ghana, its better than Jean Mensa being seen as the EC boss, he said.
President
John Dramani Mahama
has so far received ten petitions seeking the removal of two heads of public institutions and two deputies appointed under Article 70 of the Constitution.
The petitions target officials at the
Electoral Commission
(EC) and the Office of the Special Prosecutor (SP).
Seven petitions have been filed against EC Chairperson Jean Mensa and her two deputies, Dr Bossman Eric Asare, responsible for Corporate Services, and Samuel Tettey, in charge of Operations.
Three more petitions seek the removal of Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng.
All petitions have been forwarded to the Chief Justice, Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie.

2024 Kpandai NDC PC seeks contempt action against EC chair Jean Mensa,"The National Democratic Congress (NDC) Parliamentary Candidate for Kpandai in the 2024 general election, Daniel Nsala Wakpal, has filed a motion at the Tamale High Court seeking to have the Chairperson of the
Electoral Commission
(EC), Jean Mensa, cited for contempt.
According to court documents filed by his lawyers, the EC Chair allegedly failed to comply with a High Court order issued on 24 November 2025, which directed the Commission to conduct a fresh parliamentary election in Kpandai within 30 days.
The application states that the EC Chair was officially served with the order on 25 November 2025 but has shown no sign of implementing the directive.
By the conduct of the respondent, it is clear that she has no intention to abide by the court order dated 24 November 2025, the affidavit supporting the motion reads.
The affidavit further argues that willful disobedience of a lawful court directive constitutes contempt of court.
The EC chairs refusal to abide by the order of the court... is contemptuous of this Honourable Court, it stated, adding that the conduct interferes with the administration of justice.
The motion therefore prays the High Court to convict the EC Chair for contempt over what Wakpal describes as an obvious disregard of the courts ruling.
On 24 November 2025, Justice Emmanuel Brew Plange of the Tamale High Court ordered a fresh parliamentary election in Kpandai within 30 days after ruling on a petition filed by Wakpal challenging the results of the 2024 parliamentary election.
The petition centred on alleged irregularities during voting and result collation, targeting 41 out of 152 polling stations, where discrepancies were said to compromise the integrity of the final outcome.
Wakpal, who served as MP in the eighth parliament, argued that the 7 December 2024 election breached Regulations 39 and 43 of the Public Elections Regulations, 2020 (CI 127).
He sought an annulment of the disputed polling station results and a rerun.
The court upheld his petition, nullifying the contested results and directing the EC to conduct a fresh election to determine the duly elected MP for the constituency.
The ruling overturned the declared victory of the New Patriotic Partys (NPP) Matthew Nyindam.",,Politics,  6 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/2024-Kpandai-NDC-PC-seeks-contempt-action-against-EC-chair-Jean-Mensa-2012422
Rule of law must apply to all - Abu Jinapor challenges Majority over OSP scrutiny,"A former Minister of Lands and Natural Resources and Member of
Parliament
for Damongo, Samuel Abdulai Jinapor, has launched a blistering challenge at the Majority Caucus, urging them to stop posturing and boldly repeal the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) Act if they truly believe the institution is unconstitutional.
Speaking on the floor of
Parliament
on Thursday, December 4, 2025, Jinapor recalled that the current Majority Leaderthen Member of
Parliament
for Bawkuvehemently opposed the establishment of the OSP in the previous
Parliament
.
He argued that it is therefore inconsistent for the same figure to now raise constitutional questions about an office he had opposed from the beginning.
According to him, he has long articulated the national importance and rationale behind the establishment of the OSP, yet members of the Majority still persist in questioning its constitutionality.
He added that the Speakers own concerns regarding the budget allocation to the OSPciting non-performancefurther fuel the renewed debate over the existence of the institution.
Quoting the former Minister, he said: Mr Speaker, they have the Majority  and the Super Majority. Whats happening in this country? You just made the point about allocations to the OSP and the issue of reset.
""Too much talking; the country needs action. If you think the OSP is not fit for purpose, repeal it. You call yourselves Super Majority and call us micro minority, but we believe we are a mighty minority. What are you waiting forone year down the road?
Jinapor also expressed worry over what he described as the selective application of Ghanas laws, pointing to individuals who have endured severe bail conditions while others appear cushioned when they fall foul of the law.
Kpebu drops bombshell on Kissi Agyebengs OSP appointment
He referenced several cases: Mr Speaker, you spoke about how we enact the laws and how they are applied. Look at how Chairman Wontumi had to spend months in custody because the bail conditions were too much.
""Today, Osei Assibey is still in custody because he cannot meet the conditions. I recall what happened to Paul Adom-Otchere. But now that the law has caught up with one of their own, suddenly the OSP is being questioned?
Background
The Minority has consistently maintained that the renewed attention and heightened criticism from the Majority regarding the OSP is directly linked to recent developments involving the institution, particularly its altercation and subsequent arrest of one of their own, Martin Kpebu.
'The Office of Special Prosecutor has no constitutional basis' - Speaker Bagbin
According to the Minority, the sudden scrutiny is not driven by principle but by political discomfortfurther fueling their belief that the Majoritys posture is a reactionary attempt to shield allies.

Bawumia's favorability rate increases as NPP primaries near - Global InfoAnalytics,"With less than two months for the NPP to go to the polls to elect its 2028 presidential candidate, former Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia is on course to be retained by members of the NPP as Flagbearer, Global Info Analytics have reported.
In a detailed breakdown and analysis of its latest survey yesterday, the Executive Director of Global InfoAnalytics, Mussa Dankwah said the favorability rate of Dr Bawumia, among NPP delegates, had risen from the last period of survey, while those of the other contenders had declined.
Dankwah explained that questions were posed to respondents about how favorable they saw each candidate - a process used to measure the popularity of the candidates as the election nears.
According to Global InfoAnalytics, Dr Bawumia had 91% favorability rate in the last period of survey, and with the election getting closer, his favorability rate has gone up by 1% to 92% - a situation he described as positive.
""It tells you something here. When your favorability is increasing, it means you are going to translate that into vote. If it is reducing, it means you're going to lose to votes,"" explained Mussa Dankwah.
From Mussa Dankwah's analysis, the latest survey will be concerning to Kennedy Agyapong and the other contenders, as their favorability rate dropped.
Kennedy Agyapong dropped 5% from 88% to 83%, which means he's losing votes, while Bryan Acheampong also dropped from 83% to 81%. Osei Adutwum maintained his favorability rate of 77% while Kwabena Adjei Agyepong dropped 4 points from 76% to 72%.
On the general outlook, the Global InfoAnalytics noted that Bawumia is way ahead with 43%, while Kennedy Agyapong follows with 18%. The rest are Bryan Acheampong at 5%, while Yaw Osei Adutwum and Kwabena Adjei Agyepong are at near zero.
However, as much as 34% of delegates were either undecided or unwilling to disclose their votes, thus presenting the candidates to battle for the 34% at stake.
With Bawumia at 43%, he will require less than one third of the 34% undisclosed and undecided votes to cross the 50% plus 1 margin to win.
Bawumia Stretches Lead In New Social Media Poll
Meanwhile in a separate survey conducted only on social media among NPP supporters, the Global InfoAnalytics reported that Bawumia has increased his votes from the last poll in September, while his closest contender, Kennedy Agyapong has declined.
""For the NPP race according to the social media edition of the poll among NPP voters, DMB (Bawumia) extends his lead from 56% in September to 75% in December 2025 poll. Kennedy Agyapong saw a sharp drop from 40% to 18%, Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum also recorded a decline from 3% to 1%, Dr Bryan Acheampong rose from 1% to 5% and Kwabena Agyepong also from 0% to 1%.",,Politics,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Bawumia-s-favorability-rate-increases-as-NPP-primaries-near-Global-InfoAnalytics-2012345
91% of NPP delegates say religion and ethnicity don't matter for flagbearer  Poll,"Latest survey by Global InfoAnalytics has revealed that overwhelming majority members of the NPP don't consider religious and ethnic affiliations important in the party's Flagbearership race.
Ethnic and religious commentaries have characterised the NPP Primaries campaign, with some of the aspirants urging delegates to consider dominant ethnic and religious groups in the NPP in their selection of Flagbearer for the party.
However, the Global InfoAnalytics, in an extensive  analysis of its latest survey on the NPP Primaries, said majority of delegates don't see it as important, as the percentage in this category keeps growing.
""We asked them about the importance of religion; how important was it. 4% said it was important, neutral 5% and not important 91%,"" the Executive Director of Global InfoAnalytics, Musa Dankwa said.
PP Primaries: 63% of 'die-hard' NPP members rooting for Bawumia - Poll
He explained further that from their last survey, the percentage of those who said religion and ethnicity was key for them had also sharply declined.
""We have seen a sharp decline in those who say religion is not important. In the last period it was 13%. It is now down to 4%,"" he said.
Musa Dankwa added that the same figure  also said ethnicity was not an important consideration, meaning 91% said it was not an important consideration, 5% remained neutral while 4% said it's important.",,Politics,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/91-of-NPP-delegates-say-religion-and-ethnicity-don-t-matter-for-flagbearer-Poll-2012344
Dr Prempeh's team says key education reforms were completed before Adutwum,"The office of former Education Minister Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh has escalated its response to what it calls deliberate historical distortions being pushed by associates of former Minister Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum.
According to Dr Prempehs camp, claims that Dr Adutwum spearheaded major curriculum reforms, teacher training transformation, and the turnaround in WASSCE performance are factually wrong and undermine the work of dozens of education agencies that delivered these reforms before 2021.
This latest clarification dismantles three key claims: curriculum reform, teacher education restructuring, and the improvement in Integrated Science pass rates.
Curriculum reforms were designed and completed before 2021
The statement stresses that Ghanas most sweeping curriculum reforms in decades were already completed under Dr Prempeh.
Key timelines include:
2018: Launch of the Standards-Based Curriculum for KG and Primary.
2019: Full implementation of the new KG and Primary curriculum.
2020: Finalisation of the Common Core Curriculum (CCC) for JHS and SHS 1.
These landmark reforms, it notes, were executed through the coordinated work of NaCCA, NaSIA, GES, and other sector agencies.
Teacher training transformation started long before Adutwum became Minister
Dr Prempehs office also rejects suggestions that the teacher training overhaul originated after 2021.
It points out that the transition from the Diploma to the four-year Bachelor of Education (B.Ed) in Colleges of Education took effect in 2019, well before Dr. Adutwum assumed full ministerial leadership.
The reform was implemented with strong technical support from T-TEL, and forms the backbone of Ghanas modern teacher education system.
WASSCE integrated science pass rates improved before 2021  WAEC data confirms
To counter assertions about WASSCE gains under Dr. Adutwum, the statement cites verified WAEC statistics:
2016: 26.7% pass rate in Integrated Science
2019: 62.94% pass rate
These remarkable improvements happened before 2021, the statement emphasises, describing them as the result of systemic reforms, not individual political credit-taking.
Give Credit Where It Is Due
The release concludes with a strong caution against attempts to reassign the achievements of the education sectors workforce:
Over 20 agencies contributed to these reforms. Their work must be acknowledged, not rewritten for political convenience.",,Politics,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Dr-Prempeh-s-team-says-key-education-reforms-were-completed-before-Adutwum-2012321
"'Stop the Distortion': Dr Opoku Prempeh says Free SHS, ESP not Adutwum's legacy","The office of former Minister of Education, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has issued a strong rebuttal to what it describes as deliberate historical distortions contained in a recent pro-Adutwum publication that sought to credit Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum with major national education reforms.
In a firm statement titled A Necessary Correction, Dr Prempehs camp accuses Team Adutwum of misrepresenting timelines, appropriating policy achievements, and overlooking the foundational work executed under the first Akufo-Addo administration.
ESP 20182030: It is not his strategic plan
A major point of contention is the claim that the Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 20182030 is Dr Adutwums creation.
The rebuttal sharply refutes this, outlining the actual chronology:
Work on the ESP began in 2016.
It was completed and launched for implementation in 2018.
The ESP is a sector-wide national development blueprint, developed under Dr Prempehs leadership during his tenure from 2017 to 2021.
The statement calls attempts to brand the ESP as a personal achievement of Dr. Adutwum a clear effort to rewrite Ghanas educational history.
Free SHS: The timeline is not up for debate
Dr Prempehs office also takes issue with suggestions that Dr Adutwum played a central role in the rollout of Free Senior High School.
According to the rebuttal:
Free SHS was launched in September 2017.
The first Free SHS cohort completed WASSCE in 2020.
Dr Adutwum had not yet been approved by Parliament as Deputy Minister when the budget funding Free SHS was read in March 2017.
The statement underscores that Free SHS was conceptualised, designed, costed, funded and rolled out under Dr Prempeh, making any attempt to reassign credit both misleading and historically inaccurate.

Ntim Fordjour demands NDC apology to Akufo-Addo,"The Ranking Member on Parliaments Defence and Interior Committee, Rev John Ntim Fordjour, has called on the governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) to render an unqualified apology to former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and the people of Ghana for what he describes as the partys longstanding opposition to critical investments in the Ghana Armed Forces, particularly the Ghana Air Force.
In a statement issued on Thursday, December 4, 2025, the Assin South MP revisited events from 2008, when then-President John Agyekum Kufuor initiated the procurement of two presidential jets for the Ghana Air Force, making an initial payment of US$38 million.
Rev Ntim Fordjour noted that when the NDC assumed office in 2009 under the late President John Evans Atta Mills, the administration cancelled the agreement and opted instead to acquire only one Falcon 900EX.
According to him, that decision marked the beginning of a pattern of politicised resistance by the NDC toward defence-related expenditure a trend he believes continued during President Akufo-Addos tenure from 2017 to 2025, when efforts were made to retool and modernise the military.
Rev Ntim Fordjour argued that the same NDC that resisted Akufo-Addos retooling agenda is now seeking to undertake a major Air Force revitalisation programme, as outlined in the 2026 Budget presented by Finance Minister Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson on November 13, 2025.
The budget announced plans to procure four modern helicopters, one long-range aircraft and one medium-range aircraft beginning in 2026, aimed at replacing the countrys severely depleted fleet, which has now been reduced to just one operational military aircraft.
While the initiative has been broadly welcomed, some opposition voices have accused the NDC of inconsistency, criticising the Akufo-Addo administration for similar proposals, only to pursue the same agenda now that it is in government.
Rev Ntim Fordjour stated that, unlike the NDC in previous years, the current NPP Minority will support the procurement process without politicisation.
Today, we NPP MPs in opposition  the Mighty Minority take the moral high ground to support the acquisition of aircraft for the Ghana Air Force, he said.
We will not politicise nor oppose what is right for the state and the Air Force.
He insisted that the NDC must apologise for what he described as actions that undermined Ghanas defence capacity.
We urge the NDC government to apologise to Ghanaians and President Akufo-Addo for opposing investment into the Air Force, he added.
The debate over military retooling has intensified as Parliament prepares to consider defence-related provisions in the 2026 Budget, with both sides trading accusations over past and present commitments to national security.

"Dr Amoakohene sues Democracy Hub's Wendell, media house","A lawsuit has been filed by Ashanti Regional Minister Dr
Frank Amoakohene
against Wendell Nana Yaw Yeboah of Democracy Hub, accusing him of defamation over comments made during a live radio interview and later circulated on social media.
The minister has also sued Aluta FM and its presenter, Agyaba Owusu, also known as Agyaba Kwaku.
The suit, dated December 4, 2025 and filed by his lawyer Ibrahim Halidu, stems from comments made on November 18, 2025, during the Anopa Koko Morning Show on Aluta 92.1 FM, a Madina-based station with a sizeable online audience.
According to the court filings, Wendell Yeboah appeared as a guest on the morning show and falsely and with malicious intent alleged that Dr Amoakohene was involved in illegal mining, commonly known as galamsey.
Police arrest Democracy Hub member over galamsey allegations against regional ministers
The documents also indicated that Yeboah made the allegation in both Twi and English, telling listeners: Alright, mene wo kasa sesei, the Ashanti Regional Minister is into Galamsey, and later repeating, Alright, as I speak with you right now, the Ashanti Regional Minister is into Galamsey.
Dr Amoakohene insists the accusations were unfounded and aimed at damaging his reputation.
The suit further accuses Aluta 92.1 FM of amplifying the claims by livestreaming the interview on Facebook and subsequently republishing the content.
The minister also alleges that the station produced and circulated a promotional flyer that echoed the allegations.
He argues that these actions caused significant harm to his reputation and subjected him to public ridicule.
He is therefore seeking damages and a full retraction of the statements.
Yeboah, meanwhile, was released from CID custody on December 3, 2025, after spending a week in detention.
His arrest followed his claims on live radio accusing three regional ministers of involvement in galamsey: Eastern Regional Minister Rita Akosua Adjei Awatey, Ashanti Regional Minister Dr
Frank Amoakohene
, and Western Regional Minister Joseph Nelson.
His detention was prompted by a petition to the CID filed by Daniel Sasu Omari and two others on behalf of the ministers, calling for a full investigation into the allegations.

Parliament approves US$60 million deal for new aircraft for Ghana Air Force,"$60 million has been approved by
Parliament
for the purchase of a Falcon 6X aircraft for the Ghana Air Force under a deal between the Ministry of Defence and Dassault Aviation.
Parliament
also greenlit a 125 million agreement with Airbus Helicopters SAS for one H160 and three H175 helicopters.
The government said these acquisitions are part of modernisation and retooling programme aimed at addressing the Air Forces ageing fleet and improving its operational capabilities.
Here's how many new helicopters the GAF is getting from 2026
The minority caucus had previously questioned the governments decision to procure new aircraft, asking why earlier requests for similar purchases had been repeatedly turned down.
This follows Finance Minister Dr Cassiel Ato Forsons announcement in
Parliament
on November 13, 2025, that the government plans to acquire four modern helicopters, one long-range aircraft, and one medium-range aircraft starting in 2026.
The new aircraft are expected to be delivered within four years and will support a variety of Air Force operations, including aerial surveillance, troop and logistics transport, maritime patrols, air defence, disaster response, and medical evacuations.
Dr Ato Forson explained that the acquisitions are necessary because the current fleet is ageing and requires extensive maintenance, which limits operational readiness.
Speaking on November 20, 2025, former Defence Minister and Bimbilla MP Dominic Nitiwul highlighted the urgent need for a strategic lift to strengthen national defence.
I have served the military for eight years, and I hold the same view now as I did then: it is not in our interest as a country to be without a strategic lift. We need it, Nitiwul said.
He also challenged the government to justify its previous inaction, adding: The government should own up. If you want to buy two aircraft now, one long-range and one medium-size, explain why similar purchases were rejected over the past five years, apologise to Ghanaians, and convince us of your plan.

Former President Kufuor names his top-rated minister during his era,"Dr Richard Anane, a former Minister of Roads and Highways under former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
's administration, has been described by the ex-President as his favourite minister for his hard work and competence.
Dr Anane served as Minister of Health and later as Minister of Roads and Highways between 2001 and 2006.
In an interview on TV3 on November 26, 2025, the former President said Dr Anane played a central role in the development of major road networks in Accra and beyond during his tenure as Roads Minister.
He pointed to major road projects such as the AccraKumasi stretch, the MallamYamoransa highway, and the road from Tema to Aflao.
He also noted that significant policy initiatives, including the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme, happened while Dr Anane was Health Minister.
Anane wins at Supreme Court
He was instrumental in the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme, which benefited many Ghanaians. And when he moved to the Roads Ministry, the impact was clear. If you look at the AccraKumasi Road, from Nkrumah Circle through the George Bush Highway, from Mallam all the way to Yamoransa, and then Tema to Aflao, up to areas in the Volta Region like Nkonya and Dambai, even from Tamale to Yendithese developments happened within just four to five years. He was very hardworking, Kufuor said.
He added that, in his view, Dr Anane was second to none as a minister.
Kufuor described him as a capable medical doctor with a strong work ethic, adding that although some people were overly critical of him, Dr Anane consistently delivered wherever he was placed.
In 2006, while serving as Minister of Road Transportation, Dr Anane faced corruption allegations that led him to resign.
A CHRAJ investigation claimed he had used state funds to send about $100,000 to a woman in the United States, a matter linked to a personal relationship. CHRAJ recommended his dismissal.
Dr Anane stepped down and challenged the findings in court, insisting he had done no wrong. The court later cleared him, ruling that CHRAJ had overstepped its authority by conducting an investigation without any formal petitioner. Following the ruling, President Kufuor asked him to return to his post.
Speaking about the matter, the former President maintained that no evidence of corruption was ever established against Dr Anane, noting that some people chose to attack his reputation without proof.
It wasnt established anywhere that Dr Anane was corrupt. He had a personal issue involving a lady in America and was supporting her and their child. Somehow people twisted it to suggest he had sent $90,000, but there was no evidence. People just chose to malign him, Kufuor stated.
Kufuor said he believed he managed the situation appropriately by advising Dr Anane to resign early and clear his name through legal processes, which eventually vindicated him.
When the issue came up and CHRAJ got involved, I advised him to resign and go through the legal process. The court later ruled that the case had not been properly established. That is why I asked him to return to continue his work. Politics is tricky, I can tell you, he noted.
He concluded by reiterating that Dr Anane remained one of the most effective ministers in his government, He was my favourite for good reason. I came into government to assemble ministers who would work for the people, and Anane was one of the very best.

'Is this how Ghana's liabilities should be discussed?' - Agyemang criticises UK envoy,"Kingsley Agyemang, the former Registrar of the Scholarships Secretariat, has refuted allegations made by Ghanas UK High Commissioner, Sabah Zita Benson, that he left Ghanaian students stranded abroad with a 32 million debt.
In a statement to journalists, the Abuakwa South MP characterised the accusations as misleading, politically motivated and ignorant of the Secretariats longstanding financial framework.
According to him, he inherited a debt of GH230 million (approximately $54 million), yet no student was sent home during his tenure.
He explained to the journalists that scholarship debts naturally roll over because academic years do not align with the governments financial calendar.
Scholarship debt is continual and moves according to the academic year... This is not new, he claimed.
In his view, the commentary made by the High Commissioner was unbecoming of a diplomat and risked tarnishing Ghanas international image.
Her Excellency is above this pettiness... Is this how Ghanas liabilities should be discussed in the United Kingdom? he asked.
I am waiting for them to do their work. And let me be clear, the money we are talking about is not in my pocket, he added.",,Politics,  5 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Is-this-how-Ghana-s-liabilities-should-be-discussed-Agyemang-criticises-UK-envoy-2012300
'The Office of Special Prosecutor has no constitutional basis' - Speaker Bagbin,"The Speaker of Parliament,
Alban Bagbin
, has questioned the constitutional basis of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP).
According to him, the office was established as a statement of intent to fight corruption than as a constitutionally mandated office.
Speaking during a debate in Parliament on the effectiveness of the OSP, on Thursday, November 4, 2024, he noted that Ghana only created the OSP to prove a point that it was prepared to tackle corruption.
If you recall during the deliberation on the OSP, a number of us stated on the floor of this House that it has no constitutional basis, but we wanted to signal to the world that we are going to fight corruption, Bagbin stated.
The Speaker warned that continued funding of the Office without tangible results is unsustainable.
Kpebu to drag OSP before Mahama
At the end of the day...we cannot continue to allocate huge sums to the same office when we are not getting the results. This is one of the agencies we should be looking at, he remarked.
His comments follow the arrest and detention of private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu by the OSP.
Kpebu, accused of obstructing an OSP officer, had been invited on December 3, 2025, to assist with investigations into corruption allegations he had made against the Special Prosecutor.

"Dr Opoku Prempeh's camp refutes claims on double-track, STEM, TVET and data reforms","The office of former Minister of Education, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has issued a strong rebuttal to claims suggesting that former Minister Dr
Yaw Osei Adutwum
introduced or implemented some of Ghanas major education sector reforms, including the Double-Track system, the national STEM agenda, TVET restructuring and key data reforms.
In a detailed statement, Dr Prempehs team described the assertions as historically inaccurate, stressing that the reforms were conceived, approved and executed under his leadership between 2017 and 2020.
According to the statement, the Double-Track system, introduced to manage the surge in enrollment following the Free Senior High School policy was announced in 2018, approved by Cabinet the same year and developed under the supervision of Dr Prempeh with technical input from Dr Tandoh.
The camp insists that attributing the implementation of Double-Track to Dr Adutwum has no factual basis.
The statement further notes that Ghanas current STEM push was already embedded in the Education Strategic Plan (ESP) 20182030, a blueprint prepared during Dr Prempehs tenure.
The team emphasised that the foundational direction, planning and strategic orientation for STEM education were in place long before Dr Adutwum took office as Minister.
The rebuttal also challenges claims regarding TVET restructuring.
According to the document, the national TVET reform framework now widely recognized as transformational was designed by TVET expert Dr George Afeti and his team.
The statement categorically asserts that Dr Adutwum made no contribution to the formulation of this framework.
The team also rejects claims that data system cleanups and accountability reforms were introduced after 2021.
They argue that major reforms, including EMIS cleaning, data audits and system restructuring were executed between 2017 and 2020.
The statement concludes with a caution to Dr Adutwums supporters, Facts must remain facts.
The national reforms delivered between 2017 and 2021 cannot be reassigned for political expediency.
It calls on Team Adutwum to withdraw what it describes as unfounded and misleading claims, insisting that the historical record of Ghanas education reforms must be preserved.

Parliament to invite Kissi Agyebeng over detention of Martin Kpebu,"The Majority Chief Whip in
Parliament
,
Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor
, has called for Special Prosecutor Kissi Adjebeng to appear before the House over allegations of gross abuse of power.
His comment follows the arrest and detention of private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu on Wednesday, December 4, 2025, by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), which accused him of obstructing the work of one of its officers.
Speaking on the floor of
Parliament
on Thursday, December 4, 2025, Dafeamekpor
accused the Special Prosecutor of 'weaponising the powers of his office against citizens.'
Martin Kpebu recounts reason for his detention by OSP
He explained that The Office of the Special Prosecutor has abused his powers in this matter, and I will not hesitate to say that this House, we created the office and if he continues to abuse its powers, then we may have to abrogate it.
You had no business inviting Kpebu - Prof Mike Oquaye slams OSP
Let me place this matter on record that this House shall be inviting him (the OSP) to come and brief the House on the circumstances under which he would detain a citizen under such flimsy, whimsical circumstances. It is untenable, and yesterday his conduct was frowned upon by the entire nation.
Kpebu, a critic of the OSPs handling of high-profile investigations, including the probe into former Finance Minister
Ken Ofori-Atta
, was arrested on December 3, 2025, after an altercation with an OSP officer.
He was held at an undisclosed location before being granted bail with one surety in the form of landed property and released hours later.

'The Office of Special Prosecutor must be abolished' - Majority Leader,"The Majority Leader in
Parliament
,
Mahama Ayariga
, has renewed calls for the abolition of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), insisting that the recent detention of private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu points to
constitutional flaws within the institution.
According to him, the Attorney Generals Office should be strengthened to investigate and prosecute corruption cases.
Contributing to discussions on the floor of
Parliament
on Thursday, December 4, 2025, he recounted the circumstances that led to Martin Kpebu's detention.
Mr Speaker, it is obvious that that practitioner had publicly criticised the manner in which the Special Prosecutor was going about performing his functions. He was invited and I'm told that at the entrance to the Special Prosecutor, he sought to address the media which was objected to by the security detail at the office, and I think there was some altercation between him and the security responsible for the building that houses the Special Prosecutor,"" he stated.
Mahama Ayariga
noted that the decision to detain Kpebu triggered widespread public reactions.
Subsequently, it was ordered that he should be detained. It took the intervention of most Ghanaians on social media and people calling the Special Prosecutor and demanding that he should release the legal practitioner, he said.
He further explained that he opposed the idea of the establishment of the OSP in
Parliament
from the onset.
Mr Speaker, I recall vividly in this chamber when the proposal to establish the Office of Special Prosecutor was presented, I opposed it. I opposed it. The Hansard will bear me out because I took a position that it is unconstitutional to strip the Attorney General of the power to be responsible for the prosecution of criminal cases, he argued.
He noted that
Parliament
struggled from the outset to align the institution with the  1992 Constitution.
The fact that we had to struggle and nuance the whole process clearly betrays the fact that we knew we were doing something that didn't sit well with our constitutional architecture, he added.
The Majority Leader also questioned the impact of the office after nearly eight years.
Tell me what is really the achievement of that office. What has been the achievement of that office? I cannot see my way clear in terms of the achievement of that office, he said.
Kpebu to drag OSP before Mahama
He maintained that corruption is fought with political will, not the creation of multiple institutions.
Fighting corruption is not about littering the place with institutions. It is the political commitment of those who lead that fight corruption, not the designations of institutions that have been established, he said.
Mahama Ayariga
, thereby, urged
Parliament
to abolish the OSP, arguing that a strengthened Attorney Generals office would deliver better results.
You had no business inviting Kpebu - Prof Mike Oquaye slams OSP
I believe that it is high time that this
Parliament
reconsider its decision to approve the establishment of the Office of Special Prosecutor. I think that we should abolish it. I honestly think we should abolish it because we've experimented it and we cannot see any achievement.
If the institution of Attorney General that we establish in our constitution is adequately resourced and protected by
Parliament
and held accountable by
Parliament
, I believe that that office will equally deliver, he stressed.
Meanwhile, private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu, who was detained by the OSP on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, for allegedly obstructing an officer, has been released after almost five hours.
He described the arrest as unnecessary and insisted it reflected broader problems at the OSP.
According to him, My arrest is a confirmation that Kissi Agyebeng is incompetent.
Kpebu reaffirmed that he would petition President
John Dramani Mahama
to remove the Special Prosecutor.
I will petition for his removal. I have 15 allegations against him, he said.
The OSP has clarified that Martin Kpebu's arrest stemmed from a repeated pattern of confrontational behaviour toward security staff and not his accusations against
Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng.

The former Speaker of
Parliament
also condemned the manner in which bail conditions and investigative powers are sometimes used to show people where power lies, insisting that such practices undermine human rights and principles of law.
Martin Kpebu recounts reason for his detention by OSP
All well-meaning Ghanaians must condemn it. Bail being used to show people where power lies is not a yesterday matter; we have known this decades ago. Bail being manipulated in this regard, there is no principle in law anywhere in a civilised country. The bail that must be justified must have landed property in the name of the person who is a suspect. Does that mean that people who dont have landed properties can never get bail? What is this?
""These are matters of principles, issues of law, issues of human rights. Now, because they cant get the man on what they really wanted, they say why do you grant an interview? Do you want to suppress his freedom of speech? You cannot question his granting an interview,"" he noted.
The Office of the Special Prosecutor was established in 2018 as a specialised independent institution aimed at combating corruption in Ghana.
It operates under the framework of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and is designed to address the inadequacies of existing anti-corruption agencies.
The OSP has the authority to investigate, prosecute, and recover proceeds from corruption-related offense.

Mr Chairman, on December 7, 2024, from all the 152 polling stations in Kpandai, results were duly counted, announced, and declared by the Electoral Commission, Kodua said.
He stated that the NPPs candidate, Matthew Nyindam, won with 27,947 votes compared to the NDCs 24,213 votes, insisting that the ruling calling for a rerun was unjust.
NDC has captured state institutions, including the judiciary  NPP
Mr Chairman, it is also important to note that after the collation internally, our candidate, Honourable Matthew Nyindam, won with 27,947 votes compared to the NDCs 24,213 votes.
""Mr Chairman, it is important to state that contrary to the false impression created, which the court says that the parliamentary candidate of the NDC had no representative at the collation centre or was not present, the regional secretary of the NDC was at the collation centre,"" he said.
He further stated that, ""The NDC parliamentary candidate did not show up at the collation centre because he knew he had lost.
Kodua also criticised the High Court ruling delivered on November 24, 2025, which went beyond the 41 polling stations challenged by the NDC and disregarded the results of all 152 polling stations.
""Mr Chairman, on November 24, 2025, the High Court judge gave a ruling. It was expected that the ruling was going to centre on the 41 polling stations that were before the court, but surprisingly, the High Court judge went beyond the 41 polling stations and ignored the results of all 152 polling stations.
""Mr Chairman, this is very abysmal and disheartening to our democracy,"" he added.
Kodua also added that the NPP has, therefore, resolved to pursue the matter through the courts.
""Because we are a party of rule of law, we have decided to file an appeal on this judgment and also raise serious issues of jurisdiction of the High Court on this matter,"" he stated.

The caucus expressed concerns that the process lacked transparency and may not have delivered value for money.
The Minority pointed out discrepancies in figures and contracts surrounding the initiative, warning that these could undermine public trust and accountability.
They called on the government to provide a detailed explanation to Parliament and the public, stressing that such essential interventions must be managed with integrity to ensure resources reach the vulnerable groups they are intended to support.
The implied cost per pack would be approximately 44 Ghana cedis, raising concerns about value for money, especially considering the average market price of a sanitary pad pack is around 15 Ghana cedis, Assafuah said during a press conference at Parliament on December 3, 2025.
He added that government figures allegedly showed that 12.2 million pads were procured at a cost of GH292 million, translating to GH24 per pad.
Meanwhile, a local manufacturer had submitted a tender at GHS 20 per pad, indicating potential overpricing by the government. We demand transparency on procurement, contracts, and costs, Assafuah emphasised.
The Minority also sought answers to several questions, including who submitted tenders, which companies were awarded contracts, what criteria were used to select vendors, and what safeguards ensured fairness and competitive pricing.
They said the governments public responses had been inconsistent, raising concerns over overpayment, non-reconciliation of beneficiary numbers, and requests for new allocations despite undistributed pads.
Dr Clement Apaak, Deputy Minister of Education, denied allegations of corruption or scandal, describing claims that pads were sold at GH45 as chop bar arithmetic.
Dr Apaak explained that the cost of transportation and distribution was factored into the procurement process, accounting for variations in price.
He added that the government had distributed 3.9 million packs of sanitary pads to students in 20,744 public basic schools and 2.6 million packs to girls in secondary and T-VET institutions, benefiting 2.5 million female students from Primary Five to Senior High School.
The Deputy Minister dismissed the Minoritys allegations as a desperate attempt to create a scandal and discredit the government, noting that the NDC under President John Dramani Mahama and the Ministry of Education had never procured pads at GH45 and would not do so.
The Free Sanitary Pad Policy, launched in April 2025, aims to provide free sanitary pads to schoolgirls nationwide, improve menstrual hygiene, reduce absenteeism, and promote gender equality.

"NDC has captured state institutions, including the judiciary  NPP alleges","The
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) has been accused by the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) of systematically capturing key state institutions, particularly the Judiciary, following what the opposition describes as the unlawful removal of former Chief Justice Gertrude Araba Esaaba Torkonoo.
Speaking at the launch of the NPPs Amended 2025 Constitution, General Secretary Justin Frimpong Kodua alleged that the NDC is tightening its grip on state institutions to influence court cases, overturn legitimately lost parliamentary seats, and weaken democratic checks and balances.
Unfortunately, the Judiciary, which is supposed to be the last vanguard of the rule of law, has suddenly been captured by the Executive, particularly after the unlawful removal of Chief Justice Gertrude Araba Torkonoo, Kodua said.

He further claimed that judges are increasingly hesitant to deliver rulings strictly based on the law for fear of retaliation from the Executive.
Some judges now invoke the chilling words of dictators like Idi Amin, you may have freedom of speech, but freedom after speech cannot be guaranteed, Kodua added.
He also accused certain judges of overstepping their authority, assuming jurisdiction where none exists and issuing politically questionable rulings in parliamentary matters.
The NPP General Secretary warned that these developments pose a serious threat to the democratic stability in Ghana and called on civil society, the clergy and the international community to take note of what he termed creeping authoritarianism.
Kodua further stated that nearly a year into the NDCs administration, the country is witnessing escalating abuse of incumbency and state-sponsored intimidation of political opponents, citing in particular the governments increasing reliance on nolle prosequi to discontinue cases involving NDC members accused of embezzling public funds.

"'Touch One, You Touch All': Sosu rallies Parliament against OSP over Kpebu arrest","The Member of
Parliament
for Madina and human rights lawyer, Francis-Xavier Sosu, has called for parliamentary intervention following the arrest and detention of private legal practitioner Martin Kpebu by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP).
Kpebu was released on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, after spending nearly five hours in OSP custody. He had been detained over allegations of obstructing an officer during a verbal confrontation at the OSP premises.
Speaking in an interview on TV3 on December 3, 2025, Sosu condemned the circumstances surrounding Kpebus arrest, describing them as unacceptable and a threat to the rights of citizens.
According to him, the incident provides ample grounds for the Constitutional, Legal and
Parliament
ary Affairs Committee on which he serves to summon the Special Prosecutor to answer questions.
I think this forms a very good basis for the Constitutional Legal and
Parliament
ary Affairs Committee, in which I also serve as a member, to call the OSP back to
Parliament
and then question the circumstances under which that happened and why that shouldn't happen in the first place.
Youre Nobodies Insult, Lawyer on Rampage: OSP speaks on Martin Kpebus arrest and detention

Parliament
is the house of the people. If you touch one, you touch all, he said.
He continued, Any Ghanian who is exercising his free right, who has not breached any law, cannot be subjected to what Martin has been subjected to. And for me, there is no way I will ever condone it, there is no way I will ever support it.
The Madina MP also questioned why the OSP was leading investigations into allegations made against the office and its head, Kissi Agyebeng, by Kpebu.
He described the development as a breach of natural justice.
If allegations are made against you, you cannot investigate yourself. You will be a judge in your own cause, he stressed.
Sosu suggested that such matters should be referred to independent bodies such as the Police Professional Standards Bureau (PPSB/IOCO) to avoid conflict of interest and restore public confidence.

Ablekuma North MP calls for inclusive policies as Ghana marks International Day of PWDs,"The Member of
Parliament
for Ablekuma North, Ewurabena Aubynn, has called for stronger enforcement of disability accessibility standards and increased investment in inclusive education as Ghana joins the world to mark the 2025 International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Delivering a statement in
Parliament
on Wednesday December 3, 2025, the MP highlighted this years global theme, Fostering disability-inclusive societies for advancing social progress, stressing the need for Ghana to strengthen systems and policies that ensure full inclusion and equal participation of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in national development.
Aubynn noted that the 2025 commemoration is historic for Ghana, which has begun implementing the Free Tertiary Education for Persons with Disabilities policy.
Launched on 25th October 2025, the policy absorbs tuition fees for all PWDs admitted to public tertiary institutions and is being executed through the Students Loan Trust Fund with support from GETFund.
She emphasised that the initiative ""is not an act of charity but a fulfilment of constitutional justice, grounded in Article 25 of the 1992 Constitution and the Persons with Disability Act, 2006 (Act 715), both of which guarantee equal access to education.""
NDC's Ewurabena Aubynn to be sworn in as MP on July 22
The Ablekuma North MP cited the 2021 Population and Housing Census, which shows that 8% of Ghanas population about 2.1 million people live with a disability.
Disability prevalence is higher among females and more common in rural communities, where access to assistive devices and services remains limited.
Visual impairment is the most prevalent disability type.
Among the elderly, 38% live with at least one disability, increasing their risk of poverty and social exclusion.
She described the statistics as evidence of ""serious socioeconomic disparities"", noting that unemployment among PWDs is nearly double the national average, while only 2530% progress beyond basic education and fewer than 5% reach the tertiary level.
She warned that despite the progress made through the free tertiary education initiative, PWDs continue to face barriers such as inaccessible public buildings, mobility challenges, high costs of assistive devices and persistent stigma.
To ensure meaningful progress, Aubynn proposed seven key interventions:
Sustainable Financing: Continuous support to SLTF and GETFund for tuition absorption.
Strict Enforcement of Building Code: Mandatory audits to ensure compliance in all public tertiary institutions.
Assistive Technology: Provision of sign-language interpreters, Braille and audio materials and screen-reading software.
Mobility Support: Transport stipends or dedicated shuttles for PWD students.
Data Systems: Better monitoring of PWD enrolment and completion rates.
Public Awareness: Nationwide campaigns to reduce stigma and promote inclusion.
Employment Opportunities: Encouraging institutions to create fair job pathways for graduates with disabilities.
She described the free tertiary education programme as bold and progressive, but warned that its impact hinges on sustained policy reform and national commitment.
Our collective responsibility, is to build a society where every Ghanaian irrespective of physical, sensory, intellectual or psychosocial disability has the environment, support and opportunity to thrive.

Here is why NPP has amended its constitution,"The opposition
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) has amended its constitution as part of measures to build a strategic framework aimed at addressing the factors that led to its defeat in the 2024 general elections.
Speaking at the unveiling of the amended constitution on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, the General Secretary of the NPP, Justin Kodua Frimpong, stated that neglect of party executives as well as weakness in communication contributed to their defeat.
National Delegates Conference: NPP delegates to vote on over 50 motions to reshape the party
Many of the challenges that resulted in our defeat in the 2024 Election have been addressed through this amendment. We are aware that one reason we did not secure the necessary votes to win the election was voter apathy, which was also fueled by the neglect felt by several former party executives.
""Under the revised constitution, we have expanded the electoral college to include former executives at both district and national levels with voting rights. This measure seeks to tackle the issue of apathy within our party, he explained.
Justin Kodua also acknowledged criticisms regarding the partys communication strategy.

He noted that despite the partys numerous achievements, lack of coordination among communication directors limited the effectiveness of its messaging.
Another factor contributing to our loss was criticism of our communication. We had accomplished a lot, but failed to communicate these achievements effectively, largely due to poor coordination among our communication directors, he said.
Justin Kodua said the amendments reflect lessons learned from the 2024 Election and are designed to strengthen party structures, engagements, and messaging ahead of future contests.

Your ministries are hurting but you say Ato is forcing - Boamah jabs government,"The Member of Parliament for Okaikwei Central, Patrick Yaw Boamah, has criticised the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) members and appointees serving under President John Mahamas administration.
During a Parliamentary debate on the 2025 sector budget estimate, the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) MP questioned why ministers from the ruling government appeared unbothered about what he called the poor release of funds to their ministries, insisting that claims that Finance Minister Dr Cassiel Ato Forson was forcing were completely unfounded.
Ato Forson warns against audit infractions by Internal Audit Committee
Taking the floor, Patrick Boamah cited the report of the Committee on Transport, which reviewed the ministrys performance for the 2025 fiscal year.
According to the committee, by September 2025 the Ministry of Transport had received only GH43 million out of its approved KPS allocation of GH165 million representing a 26 percent release rate.
Boamah expressed shock that despite the low disbursement, no expenditure had been recorded on the planned activities for the period.
Mr Speaker, the committee noted that by September 2025, the Ministry of Transport had received 43 million out of a 165 million allocation. A release rate of 26 percent and you sit here and say Ato is forcing? Forcing what? he said.
He challenged ministers and MPs on the minority side to admit they were dissatisfied with the state of their budgetary releases.
Nikpe, Hon Nikpe, are you happy with a 26 percent release? how were you able to survive the whole of 2025 on 26 percent? And you think Ato is forcing, how? you are not happy... He is collapsing your ministry. We know. The minister says you are not happy with releases.  You are not, he quizzed.
Boamah argued that the poor release of funds was undermining the effectiveness of the ministries under the NDC-led government and questioned why affected ministers were not more vocal in demanding better support.
The minister himself is not happy. Trade Minister, you are not happy. You just walked in while weve been debating your report all day, he said.
The MP further teased that some ministers had become frequent absentees because they were embarrassed by the poor resource flows to their ministries.

Ministry of Roads and Highways' GH5.3bn allocation approved by Parliament,"Parliament has approved GH5.3 billion for the Ministry of Roads and Highways for the 2026 financial year, marking a key step in governments push to expand and modernise Ghanas road network.
The allocation forms part of a broader infrastructure drive targeted at strengthening nationwide connectivity.
Alongside the approved amount, government has earmarked GH30 billion in oil revenue under the Big Push Programme to support major road development projects across the country.
The initiative is expected to finance significant upgrades aimed at easing transportation bottlenecks and improving regional access.
Presenting the Roads and Transport Committees report, sector minister Governs Agbodza welcomed the allocation but cautioned that it falls far short of the ministrys actual financial requirements.
He disclosed that the ministry is currently supervising road contracts valued at over GH110 billion.
Describing the allocation as inadequate, the Minister said the ministrys obligations extend far beyond what the 2026 budget provides.
I agree with my colleagues on the GH5 billion, but the GH5 billion allocated is not enough. Though it may sound like one of the biggest allocations, it is not enough at all, he stressed.
Despite the shortfall, the ministry says it remains committed to advancing critical road projects while continuing to engage government on securing additional resources to address funding gaps.

did after losing power, according to Member of

for Nsawam-Adoagyiri, Frank Annoh Dompreh.
Speaking to NPP delegates during Dr Bawumias campaign tour in the Eastern Region, Annoh Dompreh argued that Mahamas political comeback sets a precedent.
He said that since Mahama once served as president, left office, and later reclaimed the position, the same could happen to Dr Bawumia, who has also left office after serving two terms as vice president.
Bawumia is the kind of leader we need; he's humble and does not insult people  Ama Sey
If the so-called dead sheep could return and become president, and if Mahama could lose power and come back to lead again, then I believe former Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia can also return and become president, Annoh Dompreh said.
Dr Bawumia, the NPPs 2024 flagbearer, is currently on a regional campaign tour to meet delegates, share his vision, and court support ahead of the partys flagbearer election scheduled for January 31, 2025.
The race is expected to be competitive, with Bawumia facing opposition from former Assin Central MP Kennedy Agyapong. Other contenders include former NPP General Secretary Kwabena Agyepong, Abetifi MP and former Agric Minister Bryan Acheampong, and former Education Minister Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum.
A four-time running mate, a two-term vice president, and the NPPs 2024 presidential candidate, Dr Bawumia has told delegates that his experience and track record make him the most prepared candidate to lead both the party and the nation in 2028.

'No amount of intimidation can cow Minority Leader Afenyo-Markin' - Prof Kingsley Nyarko to NDC,"Professor Kingsley Nyarko, the Member of Parliament for Kwadaso, has said that no amount of intimidation will deter the focus of the Minority Leader, Osahen
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
, or the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) minority in Parliament.
His statement comes amidst heightened political tensions, accusing the ruling
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) of resorting to intimidation, brute force, and crude tactics to manage the minority.
In a sharp critique, Prof Nyarko challenged the NDC, asserting, ""The NDC, with all their majority in Parliament, the so-called super majority, cannot handle the NPP, the mighty minority, unless they resort to intimidation, brute force, and crude tactics. Isnt this strange?""
He directly addressed the alleged attempts to cow the opposition: ""Let somebody tell them that they cannot intimidate the minority. They cannot intimidate the leader of the minority, Osahen Alexander Afenyo-Markin. Who told them that their inferior tactics, unaccommodating posturing, and intolerant nature will cow us, especially the minority leader, into submission? That will not happen.""
The Kwadaso MP affirmed the minority's unwavering resolve, declaring, ""We shall stand resolute, solid, and repel their orchestrated onslaughts on us as we continue to expose their incompetence, short-sightedness, and lack of ideas and vision to run the affairs of the country.""
Prof Nyarko then turned his criticism towards the John Mahama-led government, claiming a lack of tangible progress since taking office approximately 11 months ago.
""This government hasnt been able to implement a single transformational policy that can yield positive gains in the economy. All that we hear is reset, reset, reset. We dont exactly know what they are resetting, except the impunity, dissipation of the image of the judiciary, and wanton abuse of power that they have been pursuing so far,"" he stated.
He added that the governments obvious incompetence and lack of capacity to deliver should be their major worry and not the intolerant and intimidating posturing they are demonstrating in Parliament.
According to Prof Nyarko, Ghanaians have belatedly realised that the reset agenda touted by the government was only a fluke, a meaningless campaign tool, and a smokescreen that puts the nation on a steep slope of social, economic, and political retrogression.
Despite being ""minute in size,"" Prof Nyarko emphasised the NPP minoritys might in strength, reiterating, ""We cant be intimidated."" He concluded by affirming the minoritys commitment to its democratic role: ""We shall continue to be the vanguard of our democracy, ensure the protection of the rule of law, individual liberties and freedoms, and the complete well-being of the citizenry.""", Nana Peprah,Politics,  2 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/No-amount-of-intimidation-can-cow-Minority-Leader-Afenyo-Markin-Prof-Kingsley-Nyarko-to-NDC-2011820
Abu Kansangbata cuts sod for modern NDC office at Fian Zone,"A former Deputy Minister and former District Chief Executive of the Nadowli District, Abu Kansangbata, has once again demonstrated his unwavering commitment to the growth and consolidation of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Fian Zone.
His vision came alive with the official sod cutting for the construction of a modern party office complex at Fian  a project that promises to bring growth, opportunity, and lasting benefits to party members in the zone.
This milestone follows the successful completion and handing over of similar offices in Wogu, Kojokpere, Issa, and Tabiasi, representing the first phase of his legacy initiative to strengthen party structures across the constituency.
These projects underscore his long-term commitment to enhancing the operational capacity and visibility of the NDC at the grassroots level.
The project is fully funded by the former minister.
Party members expressed overwhelming joy and appreciation for his action, describing it as a powerful display of loyalty and dedication to advancing the NDCs mission.
The initiative was well patronised by all well-meaning party faithful, including constituency executives, ward leaders, polling station executives, and committed supporters from across the zone.
Abu Kansangbatas investment, part of his broader legacy programme, is widely recognised as a strategic step toward strengthening the partys organisational structure and grassroots engagement.
His continued commitment has greatly boosted morale and earned commendation from leaders and supporters alike.
The ceremony recorded a massive turnout and a vibrant atmosphere, with members affirming that the new office complex will serve as a modern centre for coordination, strategic planning, and mobilisation.
It is expected to enhance engagements with youth, women, and other community stakeholders while reinforcing the partys operational strength.
Looking ahead, a similar modern NDC office is planned for construction at Bussie in the coming days, once community leaders provide a suitable plot of land.
With this development, the NDC in Fian is confident of elevating its operational efficiency and strengthening its presence across all electoral areas.
The party extended deep gratitude to Abu Kansangbata for his exemplary leadership and called on members to sustain the unity and momentum this project has inspired.",,Politics,  1 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Abu-Kansangbata-cuts-sod-for-modern-NDC-office-at-Fian-Zone-2011793
Kpandai Rerun: Nyindam runs to Supreme Court to overturn annulment of results,"The Member of
Parliament
for Kpandai, Mathew Nyindam, has filed an application at the Supreme Court to overturn a High Court ruling in Tamale that annulled the 2024 parliamentary election results and ordered a rerun of the election results.
According to a report by channelonenewsonline.com, lawyer for the embattled lawmaker, Gary Nimako Marfo, argued that the High Court, Commercial Division in Tamale, wrongfully assumed jurisdiction over the petition filed by NDC candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal.

High Court dismisses NPRAs motion in dismissal case involving NPP regional secretary,"The legal battle between the National Pensions Regulatory Authority (NPRA) and its former Takoradi Zonal Manager, Richard Takyi-Mensah, took a new turn on Monday when the Accra High Court (Human Rights Court 1) dismissed the Authoritys attempt to set aside his lawsuit.
Justice Kwame Amoakoh, who sat as a relieving judge due to the elevation of the original Labour Court judge to the Court of Appeal, ruled that the NPRAs motion was incompetent and upheld the preliminary legal objection raised by Takyi-Mensahs lawyers.
In a brief but decisive ruling, the court held that the motion filed on June 30, 2025, seeking to strike out the writ of summons and statement of claim under Order 9 Rule 8(a) and Order 11 Rule 18 of CI 47, could not stand.
'
The motion on notice... is hereby struck out as incompetent, the judge declared, clearing the way for the substantive case to proceed.
How the dispute began
The case dates back to February 2025, shortly after the change of government. Richard Takyi-Mensah, who serves as the
New Patriotic Party
s Central Regional Secretary, had been appointed in March 2023 as NPRAs Takoradi Zonal Manager. His dismissal came by way of a letter signed by the Authoritys acting Chief Executive Officer, Chris Boadi-Mensah.
The termination letter invoked a clause in his employment contract dated July 26, 2023, which allows either party to end the employment relationship with a months notice or salary in lieu of notice.
Your employment with the Authority as Manager for the Takoradi Zonal Office is hereby terminated with immediate effect, the letter stated.
The decision drew public attention partly because Takyi-Mensah had been a key witness in both the civil and criminal trials of Assin North MP, James Gyakye Quayson.
His role in those proceedings had made him a visible political figure, sparking debate over whether his removal from NPRA was political or procedural.
Speaking to Adomonline.com on the day of his dismissal, he described the action as unlawful and politically motivated.
This is illegal and amounts to pure victimization of a political opponent by the NDC government. There is no law in Ghana that bars political party executives from working at the NPRA, he said.
From dismissal to the courtroom
NPRA's Push to Raise Retirement Age to 65: A threat to Ghana's youth and workforce
In response to what he called a wrongful, politically motivated termination, Takyi-Mensah filed a suit challenging the legality of his dismissal. The case was originally filed at Labour Court 1, but the judge handling it was recently promoted to the Court of Appeal, prompting an administrative reassignment.
The NPRA, as the defendant, filed a motion to strike the suit entirely. That motion has now failed.
With the preliminary objection upheld, Takyi-Mensahs substantive claims, expected to test the boundaries of public service neutrality, political activity, and employment rights, will now move forward.
What happens next
The High Courts ruling means the NPRA must now respond fully to the substance of the allegations rather than relying on procedural objections.
The matter will return to the Labour Court for further hearing once administrative arrangements are completed.

"Bawumia Frenzy Sweeps Through Eastern Region: Akwatia, Kade and Asene Manso Akroso","There have been more emphatic endorsements for former Vice President
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
in the Eastern Region as he continues his campaign tour.
For about a week, Dr Bawumia has been engaging NPP delegates and members across the region, receiving public endorsements from key groups and influential party stalwarts.
That momentum continued on Sunday November 30, 2025, when he toured four constituencies: Kade, Akwatia, Asene Manso Akroso and Lower West Akim.
In each constituency, Dr Bawumia received a rousing welcome and open endorsements, which speakers described as the will of the people.
Constituency chairmen, MPs, former parliamentary candidates and other party influencers declared their support, a development that strengthens his campaign with two months left until the NPPs January 31 presidential primaries.
In Akwatia, where Dr. Bawumia was warmly received by delegates, the Constituency Chairman, speaking on behalf of the people, assured him of their continuous support.
Two years ago, we gave you nearly 68%. No one coerced us to vote for you. And now, when we look at your commitment, your message and your hard work, I believe the 68% you had in 2023 will increase to 86% by January 31 to honour you, the Chairman said.
So here in Akwatia, we are determined to vote for you massively. Not only that we want you to win and be President, so we are committed to working very hard to ensure that happens.
The NPP Parliamentary Candidate in the recent Akwatia by-election reiterated the Chairmans remarks, saying the constituency would repay the strong support Dr. Bawumia gave them during the by-election.
On this journey youre embarking on, we know you will be victorious by the grace of God, he said.
I am the latest victim in an election, and I know what it takes to go into an election, give your all, and not win.

Ghanaians prefer the one they know, assess him with time, and then accept him. So I am appealing to all of you not to be deceived into making a change. Let us continue to support Dr. Bawumia.

These three individuals hold significant influence in Akwatia, and tensions are often perceived to be high among their loyal supporters. However, their joint presence for a common objective sent positive signals of unity within the party.
All three stalwarts joined constituents in welcoming Dr Bawumia and later addressed party members, rallying support for his bid.
Constituency Chairman Nana Yaw Addo, speaking on behalf of the constituents, assured Dr Bawumia of their unwavering support.

Afenyo-Markin stated that MPs from both sides of the House endure challenges but insisted that the situation was more pronounced among their colleagues in the NDC.
Our brothers in the NDC, we are in Parliament with them and they are suffering. Some of them come to Parliament with Uber. Some of them are on the backbench and they are not on any board, he said.
He noted that despite these challenges, NDC MPs exhibit patience and discipline, prioritising the long-term interest of their party.
They are suffering but they have a common understanding that they have to take time for the party, he added.
Using the NDCs example, Afenyo-Markin urged members of the opposition the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) to exercise similar restraint and remain committed to party unity, even in difficult times.
According to him, political parties operate on long-term strategies and MPs and supporters alike must be willing to endure temporary hardship for wider organisational goals.

'Don't let NPP mark you down' - Maurice Ampaw cautions Kpandai rerun case judge,"Legal practitioner Maurice Ampaw has issued a warning to Justice Plange of the Tamale High Court following his recent ruling ordering a rerun of the Kpandai parliamentary election.
Speaking in an interview on his Mmra No Se Sen show on Wontumi TV, Ampaw cautioned the judge about the potential repercussions of his decision, suggesting that similar actions in the past had adversely affected other judicial officials.
Judges can be marked down, and they can say they will deal with you like they did to Torkonoo. Dont let the NPP mark you down Justice Plange, if they do who caused it? They can sit on your promotion or deal with you. So, when you are making a ruling, think about the future, he said on November 30, 2025.
He referenced comments made by Justice Baffoe-Bonnie in the famous Atta Ayi case, adding, Remember what Justice Baffoe-Bonnie said, that he was thinking about the future. So, they should ask him, if he were the Kpandai MP, would he be happy about the decision?
The Tamale High Court has ordered a rerun of the Kpandai parliamentary election, which is currently held by Matthew Nyindam of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP).
Multiple reports indicate that the petition challenging the December 7, 2024, election results was filed by National Democratic Congress (NDC) candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal.
Wakpal alleged that the polls were marred by significant irregularities.
A report by GH One TV on Monday, November 24, 2025, highlighted the development, noting, Tamale High Court orders rerun of parliamentary elections in Kpandai in 30 days. The seat is currently occupied by NPPs Matthew Nyindam.
In its ruling, Justice Plange held that non-compliance with electoral regulations substantially affected the integrity of the vote.
High Court orders rerun of Kpandai parliamentary election
The petitioner claimed that irregularities were recorded in 41 out of the 152 polling stations in the constituency.
As a result, the court has directed the Electoral Commission (EC) to supervise a rerun of the parliamentary election across the entire Kpandai constituency.
Matthew Nyindam was initially declared the winner of the December 2024 general election.
The Electoral Commission is expected to announce a date for the rerun within the 30-day directive issued by the court.

Whoever thought John Mahama can be president again? Let us face the facts, it took Asiedu Nketiah to charge through the storm after Mahama lost by over one million votes in the 2016 elections.

Look, I am pleading with every NPP member: even if the government was not fair to you, put all your anger somewhere and let us work together to win, he said.
It took Asiedu Nketiah, the Ahwois and others to put the NDC together. So, NPP, there is hope.

Kpandai rerun: GFL boss urges NDC to contest all disputed seats,"The Secretary-General of the Ghana Federation of Labour (GFL), Abraham Koomson, has called on the governing
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) to remain steadfast and aggressively pursue every parliamentary seat affected by legal or electoral disputes.
Koomson believes that winning such seats particularly those currently held by the opposition
New Patriotic Party

Speaking on Ahotor FMs Saturday show, he specifically urged the NDC to go all out to secure victory in the upcoming parliamentary rerun in the Kpandai constituency.
The NDC should be poised. They should go all out and contest any seat that has issues. And if they end up taking all such seats, I will be very happy, he said.
His comments follow a ruling by the Tamale High Court ordering a fresh parliamentary election in Kpandai.
Presided over by Emmanuel Brew Plange, the court directed the Electoral Commission (EC) to conduct the rerun within 30 days.
The decision stems from a petition by former MP and NDC parliamentary candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal, who contested the election of Matthew Nyindam as MP.
Wakpal alleged widespread irregularities in the December 7 parliamentary polls, including inconsistencies on FORM 8A (Pink Sheets) in 41 out of 152 polling stations.
The court upheld these claims, concluding that the irregularities compromised the integrity of both the voting and collation processes, thus warranting a rerun.
In response, incumbent MP Matthew Nyindam has said he is unfazed by the ruling and remains ready to contest again if required.
The Electoral Commission is expected to announce the modalities for the fresh election in the coming days.
However, Koomson insists that the NDC must prepare adequately to reclaim the seat.
He argued that workers suffered severely under the NPP administration and cautioned voters against giving the party another mandate.
As a unionist, the suffering Akufo-Addo brought to workers was unbearable. Look at the bank closures, the haircut, and the rest. We cannot afford to entertain this kind of mindset again. The NDC needs to remain focused, he added.",,Politics,  1 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Kpandai-rerun-GFL-boss-urges-NDC-to-contest-all-disputed-seats-2011648
Afenyo-Markin seeks written judgment on Kpandai election nullification,"Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin has raised fresh concerns over the judgment delivered by the Tamale High Court in the Kpandai constituency election petition which has since been declared null and void and a fresh election ordered.
The caucus leader in a statement said the outcome of the case was unlawful or unconstitutional while expressing worry over the failure of the judge in releasing the written judgment.
According to him, the failure to deliver the judgment is a procedural inconvenience and prevents the sitting MP from preparing his appeal.
He indicated that it prevents the public from understanding how a court can purport to nullify 152 polling stations when only 41 were challenged. It prevents constitutional scrutiny of a shocking decision that appears to lack constitutional and legal foundation.
He has therefore called on the presiding judge to release the written judgment.
""Hon Mathew Nyindam has filed a notice of appeal and an application for stay of execution of the order purporting to nullify the election result. The Minority group remains solidly behind him. We maintain our commitment to the rule of law. However, that commitment presupposes a functioning appellate system. Without the written judgement, the appellate process is paralyzed.
""I therefore call upon His Lordship to immediately publish the full written judgement.
""Our constitutional democracy cannot function on unexplained directives. Justice cannot be done or be seen to be done when a court issues a constitutionally questionable order affecting parliamentary representation but fails to provide timely written reasons purporting to justify that order.",,Politics,  1 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Afenyo-Markin-seeks-written-judgment-on-Kpandai-election-nullification-2011644
Current and former Abuakwa North lawmakers endorse Bawumia for 2028 NPP race,"The
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) in the Abuakwa North Constituency in the Eastern Region has thrown its unequivocal support behind former Vice President
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, affirming him as the preferred flagbearer for the party ahead of the 2028 general elections.
This strong endorsement came from both the former and current Members of Parliament for the constituency during Dr Bawumias visit to Akyem Tafo. 
Gifty Twum-Ampofo, popularly known as Hajia Kande, former Deputy Minister of Education in charge of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), and Nana Kwame Ampaw Addo Frempong, the incumbent MP for Abuakwa North, publicly declared their commitment to Dr Bawumias candidature.
Their remarks were made during a gathering at the Mid-Tafo Presbyterian Church Auditorium on November 29, 2025.  
Hajia Kande, addressing the delegates, sharply criticised what she described as propaganda deployed by the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) during the 2024 general elections. She stated that the NDC falsely blamed Dr Bawumia for Ghanas economic challenges, deliberately overlooking the significant global impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
She further noted that even President John Dramani Mahama later acknowledged at a United Nations meeting that the conflict had indeed affected Ghana's economic stability.  
Dismissing other accusations as baseless, Gifty Twum-Ampofo vehemently rejected claims that Dr Bawumia supplied weapons to his Mamprusi tribe against the Kusasi in the Upper East Region.
""Killings during the NDCs nine months in office have already surpassed the total during the NPPs eight years,"" she emphasised, asserting that Dr Bawumia's record is ""beyond reproach.""
She cautioned against introducing a new candidate, arguing it could expose the party to unnecessary criticisms. 
Urging delegates to support Dr Bawumia, Hajia Kande described him as a candidate who embodies both the welfare of the NPP and the broader development of Ghana.
She employed an analogy, advising, ""Delegates shouldnt crush the housefly eating their sour out of anger, lest they hurt their own sour while the fly escapes,"" implying that rejection of Bawumia could harm the party itself. 
Current MP Nana Kwame Ampaw Addo Frempong echoed these sentiments, stressing that for the NPP to secure victory in 2028, the party must present a ""strong and credible candidate.""
He harked back the energetic mobilisation of the youth wing during the 2016 Election, which contributed significantly to securing votes for former President Nana Akufo-Addo, and called for a similar enthusiasm to be rekindled for the 2028 general elections.  
Speaking from personal conviction, Nana Addo Frempong declared, I want to win 2028, not 2032.
He appealed for unity ahead of the flagbearer election and beyond, encouraging delegates to set aside past grievances for the collective good of the party.  
Nana Addo Frempong also claimed that NDC Members of Parliament are reportedly apprehensive about Dr Bawumias candidature due to his proven competence. He expressed concern over the oppositions attempts to reclaim NPP seats through by-elections and court rulings, citing the recent Kpandai rerun as an example.
He reassured delegates that
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
is already widely accepted within the party, possesses an ""unblemished"" record, and therefore ""requires no replacement that could jeopardize the NPPs future."" 
The event saw the presence of several notable party figures, including Nana Akomea, the former CEO of STC; Samuel Atta-Kyea, former MP for Abuakwa South; Umar Babs Bodinga, former MCE for Abuakwa North; Kofi Okyere Agyekum, former MP for Fanteakwa South; and Sammy Awuku, MP for Akuapem North. 
Nana Addo Frempong concluded by rallying delegates to vote for Dr Bawumia to ensure continued socio-economic development across Ghana.",,Politics, 30 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Current-and-former-Abuakwa-North-lawmakers-endorse-Bawumia-for-2028-NPP-race-2011615
"When Bawumia was defending NPP in difficult moments, some were making noise - Okyere Baafi","Member of Parliament for New Juaben South, Michael Okyere Baafi, has recalled the dedication and committed service of former Vice President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, to the
New Patriotic Party
over the years.
Addressing delegates of his constituency in Koforidua yesterday, during a campaign tour of Bawumia, the MP said when the going got tough for the party and bold men were required to defend the party, Bawumia came forward to do that, while some people, whom he described as ""cowards who are now making noise,""  hid under their tables.
""When it was very tough in Ghana here and some NPP big members were hiding under tables, he was the one who stood up for the party,"" Otchere Baafi said, referencing the 2012 election petition at the Supreme Court, which Bawumia was the chief witness for the NPP for 8 months.
""He defended the party at the 2012 election petition at the Supreme Court after the NPP was cheated at the polls. Some of the cowards who went into hiding are now out saying they are the real party members and Dr Bawumia is not a true member.""
Baafi, while endorsing the candidature of Dr Bawumia, also commended Dr Bawumia for standing for the party in the elections petition, as well us his contribution to electoral reforms in Ghana, which he said, helped the NPP to come to power.
""The person who stood up and defended the party at the Supreme Court and ensured that many elections reforms were implemented to pave the way for the NPP to win power, is the one I am endorsing and I am urging all of you to support on January 31.""
He described the 2028 election as a crucial one which the NPP requires an experienced and well-marketed person such as Dr. Bawumia to win.
""I'm saying that the 31st January election is not a joke. It's a crucial election and we need an experienced person. We need someone who has been well-marketed and is well known by Ghanaians. That person is
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
,"" the MP said.

Parliament
for Afram Plains South, Joseph Appiah, to withdraw a comment he made about former President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
.
According to the National Democratic Congress (NDC) MP, the former President plunged the country into a state of hardship, claiming that everyone in the nation including the former Presidents close associates was experiencing hunger.
He referenced an incident in
Parliament
where the former Presidents bodyguard collapsed in the chamber during a State of the Nation Address.
Always his people go hungry. Thats why we were starving. And it was manifest in this chamber when the former Presidents bodyguard fainted because he was hungry...under Mahamas administration, this would not happen, he said.
However, Deputy Speaker

The 'F' word is an acceptable slang and will win us the 2028 elections - OAK Coordinator,"Dr Palgrave Boakye-Danquah, the National Coordinator for the OAK (Ohene Agyapong Kennedy) movement, has asserted that the phrase motherfucker is not necessarily profane but can be interpreted as acceptable slang in certain contexts, particularly in the United States and the United Nations.
His comments were a direct response to remarks made by private legal practitioner and former Abuakwa South Member of Parliament, Atta Akyea, concerning the temperament of presidential aspirant
Kennedy Agyapong
.
Atta Akyea had advised
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) delegates against electing the former Assin Central Member of Parliament,
Kennedy Agyapong
, as the partys candidate for the 2028 presidential election.
The legal practitioner argued that the party requires a candidate who is level-headed, disciplined, and diplomatic.
While Akyea did not explicitly name the aspirant, Dr Boakye-Danquah maintained that the description and characterisation were clearly directed at Agyapong.
Dr Boakye-Danquah, who referred to the lawyer as his uncle, reminded him of the alternative interpretation, stating that motherfucker is acceptable slang that symbolises boldness, courage and strength.
To contextualise his argument, he referenced the 1992 US presidential election, noting how former President Bill Clintons famous campaign focus, Its the economy, stupid, resonated with voters and led to his victory.
Motherfucker is not a profanity or an insult. It is acceptable slang in the US and the United Nations.
""I urge the lawyer to recall 1992 in the US when Bill Clinton won the elections with the Its the economy, stupid approach. I want to tell my uncle that motherfucker is understood by Americans and the United Nations; it is a contextual issue. If Its the economy, stupid won Clinton the elections, Mother Fucker will secure our victory in 2028.
He further elaborated that the use of such strong language signifies a leader who is courageous and who will not tolerate cheats or those who undermine others.
We need a president who is bold enough to speak the language of the foreigners. A person lacking courage or boldness cannot utter Mother Fucker in the US or America. Atta Akyea is aware that Mother Fucker is not an insult and that will win us the election.
""He did not mention anyones name, but everyone knows the presidential race is a two-horse race, and thus, his comment was a stray bullet directed at our candidate.
Dr Boakye-Danquah concluded by appealing to delegates to vote overwhelmingly for the former Assin Central Member of Parliament.
He stressed that the OAK movement is neither moved nor worried by endorsements from some party leaders for Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.
He noted that with over 250,000 delegates expected to vote, the support of a few party leaders for a particular candidate does not concern the movement.
We remain strong and resolute and believe that on January 31, 2026,
Kennedy Agyapong
will be declared the presidential candidate for the NPP for the 2028 elections.

Deputy Minority Leader slams Speakers referral of Afenyo-Markin to Privileges Committee,"Deputy Minority Leader and Asokwa MP, Madam Patricia Appiagyei, has launched a blistering attack on Speaker Alban Bagbins decision to refer Minority Leader Osahen Afenyo-Markin to the Privileges Committee, describing the move as political persecution and an assault on parliamentary democracy.
Addressing journalists in Accra on Friday, 28 November 2025, Madam Appiagyei said the Speakers ruling marked the height of an orchestrated campaign to intimidate and undermine the Minority Leader.
She accused the Majority Leadership and the Speaker of weaponising parliamentary procedure to silence dissent.
Madam Appiagyei revisited the controversial events of 22 July 2025, when the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, moved to replace the Minority Leader on Ghanas ECOWAS Parliament delegationan action she said occurred without her knowledge or consent.
According to her, the Majority Leader acted stealthily and clandestinely, attempting to insert her name on the delegation while the Minority Leader was indisposed.
She said she rejected the move immediately, protesting formally in writing to the Speaker.
Despite her objection, she said, the Speaker forwarded the altered delegation list to ECOWAS, a decision she described as diplomatic orchestration and a violation of Ghanas obligations under Article 18 of the ECOWAS Supplementary Act.
Madam Appiagyei noted that the ECOWAS Parliament formally rebuked Ghana over the incident and dispatched a diplomatic mission to Accra to seek clarification.
She argued that the episode brought international embarrassment to Ghana and exposed serious procedural breaches by the Speaker and Majority.
The Deputy Minority Leader insisted that Mr Afenyo-Markin committed no wrongdoing by continuing to perform his duties as a sworn ECOWAS MP.
She said the disputed July 22 resolution was unconstitutional and thus did not bind the Minority Leader.
Quoting Articles 1, 3 and 41 of Ghanas Constitution, Madam Appiagyei stressed that every citizen is duty-bound to resist unconstitutional actions, arguing that Mr Afenyo-Markins stance was not insubordination but an act of constitutional defense.
Madam Appiagyei accused the Majority, the Speaker, NDC party operatives, and elements within the Attorney-Generals office of engaging in a coordinated effort to intimidate and discredit the Minority Leader.
She cited alleged threats from NDC National Vice-Chairman Chief Sofo Azorka, media leaks suggesting criminal investigations, and social media attacks.
In her statement, the Deputy Minority Leader called for:
Immediate withdrawal of the petition against Afenyo-Markin at the Privileges Committee.
A public apology from the Speaker and Majority Leader to ECOWAS and Ghanaians.
Restoration of Afenyo-Markin to Ghanas ECOWAS delegation.
An end to alleged state-enabled intimidation of the Minority Leader.
Prosecution of Chief Sofo Azorka for threatening the Minority Leader.
Madam Appiagyei concluded that the Minority will continue to stand by Afenyo-Markin, not only for partisan reasons but in defense of constitutional rule.
This episode is an indelible stain on Ghanas democracy, she said. We shall defend the rule of law, we shall uphold the Constitution, and we will not rest until power is exercised lawfully.",,Politics, 30 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Deputy-Minority-Leader-slams-Speaker-s-referral-of-Afenyo-Markin-to-Privileges-Committee-2011544

Bawumia, who has been campaigning in the Eastern Region all week, has had a number of MPs and party stalwarts from the region giving him firm support with their presence, and on Friday, November 28, 2025, in Akuapem, another set of electoral coordinators, also joined the growing number of coordinators who have endorsed the former Vice President.

""We want to encourage you that all is not lost. As for records, they are there to be broken. In 2016, after Mahama lost by about 1 million votes, many people thought that was the end for him.

Why the word 'tsobo' caused a prolonged stir in Parliament,"On Tuesday, November 29, 2025, the word tsobo sparked debates in Parliament during the 2026 Budget debate.
Parliamentarians are sometimes known to use colorful and dramatic expressions that are deemed unparliamentary to emphasise their arguments. As such, the use of tsobo, a slang term in Ghanaian parlance, by the Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, was not taken lightly by the Majority side.
NDC is ready for the re-run in Kpandai, so the NPP better prepare too - Dafeamekpor
During proceedings, Assafuah accused the government of inflating the prices of sanitary pads, referring to them as a tsobo government.
He argued that although the Ministry of Finance had earlier announced a drastic reduction in prices, the figures presented in the 2026 Budget appeared to show inflation instead.
In response, the Majority Chief Whip,
Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor
, strongly objected to his colleagues use of the word tsobo, describing it as unparliamentary. He called for the term to be expunged from the Hansard.
On a lighter note, amid the stir, Speaker of Parliament
Alban Bagbin
, who appeared not to understand the meaning of the word tsobo, sought clarification.
His confusion and attempt to grasp its meaning threw the chamber into a fit of laughter among some lawmakers.
Read the conversation that ensued in Parliament below:
Assafuah: Mr Speaker, the Ministry of Finance posted this on their Facebook wall. They said that sanitary pads have reduced from GH25 to GH15. According to their own words, if indeed a sanitary pad is now GH15, why are they now accounting to the people of Ghana that one sanitary pad is GH45? This is a tsobo government.
Dafeamekpor: Mr Speaker, I rise in pursuance of Order 123(1), content of speech. The Honorable Assafuah refers to the government as tsobo government. Mr Speaker, that is very unparliamentary.
Bagbin: Sorry, I didn't hear the statement.
Dafeamekpor: Mr Speaker, you may not have heard it, but it has gone into the Hansard. Mr Speaker, the Honorable Member, as part of his commentary, said the NDC government is a tsobo government. Mr Speaker, that is unparliamentary. You can say so on radio, but in this House, that language is not permissible, and so, Mr Speaker, I am seeking your guidance that that portion of the speech be expunged. Mr Speaker, thank you.
Bagbin: Are you mentioning the word T-O-G-O? Did you say Togo government?
Dafeamekpor: Mr Speaker, not Togo. He said tsobo.
Bagbin: Choco? Choco.
Dafeamekpor: Tsobo. C-H-O-B-O or T-S-O-B-O.
Bagbin: Honorable Member, please, did you say the government is tsobo government?
Assafuah: Mr Speaker, precisely so.
Bagbin: What does that mean?
Assafuah: Mr Speaker, that means that 6.6 million pads that we could have used GH99 million, they are using GH292 million to buy. More than three times of the amount.
Bagbin: Please, the meaning of tsobo government.
Minority blasts Bagbin, Ayariga; demands immediate withdrawal of contempt petition against Afenyo-Markin
Assafuah: Mr Speaker, it means wasteful. You can also say that there is no value for money.
Dafeamekpor: Mr Speaker, not at all. Mr Speaker, it is a strict expression for fleecing somebody. When you are fleecing somebody, that is the phrase we use that you are taking tsobo from the person. You are fleecing the person, and that is what he is suggesting.
Bagbin: Honorable Members, these are words I don't know which language, but I don't understand the meaning of tsobo at all, and particularly the spelling, I am told either it is C-H-O-B-O or C-H-O-G-O or whatever. I don't know.

Tarkwa-Nsuem NPP women rebuke Kennedy Agyapong over 'disrespectful' remarks,"A group of women within the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) in the Tarkwa-Nsuem Constituency have issued a strong warning to presidential aspirant
Kennedy Agyapong
, urging him never to return to the constituency following what they describe as offensive and disrespectful comments made during his recent campaign tour.
The women, who were captured in videos chanting war songs and expressing outrage, accused the Assin Central MP of exhibiting arrogance and utter disrespect toward the people of Tarkwa-Nsuem. Some even questioned whether the presidential hopeful was mentally sound enough to lead the country.
According to them, Agyapongs remarksparticularly his claim that there is no man in Tarkwa-Nsuem as brave as himselfwere not only insulting but also dangerously divisive.
This evening we are very angryangry because
Kennedy Agyapong
has infuriated us, one of the women said. He wants to tell us that when he speaks, nobody else can speak. Let me tell you something: Tarkwa-Nsuem ladies are mothers. Our children matter to us, so we do not want someone who brings disunity. Anytime he opens his mouth, there is chaos.

The women explained that their men were currently focused on identifying a capable presidential candidate to lead the NPP into the 2028 general elections, and therefore would not waste time responding to Agyapongs provocations. They stressed that they had taken it upon themselves to respond directly to him.
Another woman challenged Agyapong to point to any meaningful development he had brought to his own constituency despite serving as MP for 24 years. She contrasted this with the contributions of George Mireku Duker, who, within just eight years as MP for Tarkwa-Nsuem, instituted a teachers award scheme and donated three cars to outstanding teachers.
Background
Kennedy Agyapong
recently toured parts of the Western Region, including Tarkwa-Nsuem, as part of his campaign ahead of the NPP presidential primaries scheduled for January 31, 2026.
In videos circulating and monitored by GhanaWeb, he is seen harshly criticising former MP and Deputy Minister George Mireku Duker, accusing him of rising from poverty to wealth without showing respect.
He also questioned why Hon. Mireku Duker was made MCE for Mankessim.
Agyapong is seen in the video urging the constituency  members to blame the  constituency executives and George Mireku Duker for losing the Tarkwah / Nsuem seat
However, his claim that theres no man in Tarkwa-Nsuem as strong as himself appears to have been the final trigger that provoked the fierce backlash from the women.

NDC government is an enabler of galamsey through GoldBod  Afenyo-Markin,"The decision to allow the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod) to purchase gold from small-scale miners effectively funds galamsey, with the NDC government accused of supporting illegal mining activities, according to Minority Leader
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
.
Delivering his concluding remark to finally end the debate on the 2026 budget delivered by the Finance Minister Dr
Cassiel Ato Forson
, Afenyo-Markin argued that the NDC government has surrendered to galamsey instead of fighting it.
This government has surrendered to galamsey activities. This government has become its enabler, he said.
Prof Stephen Adei alleges President Mahama has 'legalised galamsey' through GoldBod
The Minority Leader pointed out that the budgets provision empowering the GoldBod to purchase gold from small-scale miners contradicts the governments claim of tackling illegal mining.
According to him, this move amounts to state approval of unregulated mining operations.
In this budget, the government announced that the Gold Board will buy gold from small-scale miners. They are not fighting illegal mining. Instead, the NDC government is financing it. This gives it official endorsement, he stated.
Afenyo-Markin also pointed the dangers faced by personnel tasked with combating illegal mining. He recalled the tragic loss of eight lives when a team was travelling to launch a programme against galamsey, criticizing the government for abandoning these frontline workers.
Today, members of NAIMOS are getting hurt, shot at, and even killed while fighting a battle their own government has abandoned. Eight lives were lost on their way to launch a programme to fight illegal mining, he lamented.
He further criticised the government for failing to show the necessary commitment to end illegal mining.
According to Afenyo-Markin, setting up a GoldBod to buy gold from miners who cannot be verified only encourages complicity rather than enforcement.
Today, their own government is showing neither seriousness nor commitment to stop illegal mining. They have created a Gold Board to buy gold they cannot trace and from miners they cannot verify, a system built for complicity, not enforcement.

"Character is like diarrhoea, you can't hide it forever - Atta Akyea jabs Ken Agyapong","Former New Patriotic Party Member of Parliament for Akim Abuakwa South,
Samuel Atta Akyea
, has defended 'don't elect a leader that will embarrass Ghana at the UN, which some have said was an attack on
Kennedy Agyapong
, a flagbearer hopeful of the party.
Speaking in an interview with Adom FM, shared on Facebook, on November 27, 2025, Atta Akyea did not withdraw his statement despite backlash from it.
He asserted that the supporters of Ken Agyapong, who are attacking him over his remarks, know that his comments are not far from the truth.
The person you want to become the flagbearer is not someone you can advise. Whatever Ken, who was my classmate in Adisadel, says he will do, he will do it; you cant stop it. He would even do it in public for people to record it.
So, nobody has invented any story about him. His actions that have been recorded, the things he says, the pastors who have been insulted, the leaders who were insulted, all these things are not the invention of Atta Akyea. They are things he has said, he said.
Atta Akyea, a former Minister of Works and Housing, took a swipe at Ken, saying that he cannot hide his true nature forever.
Atta Akyea once used filthy words on Akufo-Addo, so I'm not surprised - Ken Agyapong
If you have diarrhoea and you take medication, it does not mean it (the diarrhoea) has stopped... You cannot fake the condition you are in. So, if you are having a running tummy, and you go and take medication, the diarrhoea will not stop. That is what we are seeing now.
Some of the things Ken said are coming out, and people are running. People have quit on some of the issues about Ken; more could even come out, he said.

Oppong Nkrumah likens NPP primaries to biblical Solomon and the two women,"Member of
Parliament
for Ofoase Ayirebi and former Minister for Works and Housing,
Kojo Oppong Nkrumah
, has likened the ongoing internal contest of the 2028 flagbearership race of the NPP to the famous Biblical story involving King Solomon and two women over the rights to a baby.
In the Biblical narration, one of the two feuding women for the rightful ownership of the baby did not care about the safety of the baby and asked King Solomon to slit the baby into two and give equal parts to them. But the wise King Solomon was able to determine the rightful mother, following the insensitive and jealous posture of the other woman, who did not show empathy and care for the baby.
Speaking to NPP delegates of his constituency today, Oppong Nkrumah said some of the NPP aspirants were behaving like the woman who wanted the baby destroyed because she was not the rightful owner.
""I want to refer all to the Bible, First Kings 3:16. This is where you find King Solomon and the two women who were fighting for the rights to a baby,"" Oppong Nkrumah told his constituents.
When one of the women had opted for the baby to be slit, the other maintained that the baby be kept in the custody of the one who insisted the baby be killed, for it might grow to serve mankind.
However, King Solomon saw this woman's ingenuity and ruled that she was the mother of the baby.
Likening the situation to the ongoing internal contest of the NPP, Oppong Nkrumah said utterances by some of the aspirants are aimed at creating confusion and disaffection for the party, just as the jealous woman in the King Solomon story who wanted the baby killed.
""When you look at the conversations going on in our internal contest, you'll realise that whilst some of the aspirants are conducting themselves in a manner that promotes party unity and internal cohesion, others are stoking fire and fuelling disunity, just like the woman who wanted the baby killed,"" he said.
""When you listen to the messages of some of the aspirants, it is all about disunity, knocking heads together and causing confusion in our party. They only say things that will make the party unattractive.""
""However, one man, Dr Bawumia, never does that. Today that he's here, he won't insult anybody; he won't say things that will bring disunity to the party. He always talks about his vision and what he will do for this party and the country.""
NPP Primaries: 63% of 'die-hard' NPP members rooting for Bawumia - Poll
""So if you want to know, in Biblical context, who you think is the rightful owner (of the child) in this our internal context, as is said in Kings 3:16, the one who is creating disunity and chaos is not the rightful owner.""
Oppong Nkrumah appealed to the party's delegates to see through and make the best decision for the NPP by electing Dr Bawumia to continue what the party is building.
""I always say that in this party, we always build up to a level and then some people try to bring everything down. God has given us a gift because despite all the challenges in 2024, we had a man who was able to lead us to secure 41.7%.
""We have an opportunity to present him again and build on what we have done, but some people are bent on destroying everything with divisive comments and asking you to destroy everything. These are people who do not love the party's progress.""

"Dr Ekua Amoakoh slams 'bogus anti-Zipline agenda' report, regressive politics","A Deputy Spokesperson to the former Vice-President, Dr Ekua Amoakoh, has faulted the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) of attempting to drag Ghanas health sector into the dark ages through what she describes as deliberate misinformation about the operations of medical drone-delivery project that has saved many lives
In a statement, the Deputy Spokesperson to the former Vice-President questioned whether, when a new maverick system is introduced, it is not wiser to tweak and improve it to better serve the citizenry rather than embarking on a needless smear campaign, and cited Leo Szilards words: Do not destroy what you cannot create.
She said the NDCs recent commentary on Zipline reflects a shameful and laughable attempt to discredit an initiative that has improved access to essential medical supplies in remote areas. According to her, the NDCs posture is only an attempt to conceal what she called the partys gross incompetence and lack of innovative policy direction for the health sector.
Her comments come in response to remarks by the Member of Parliament for Lambussie, Dr Titus Beyuo, who disclosed findings from a review of Ziplines operations ordered by the Minister of Health.
Speaking on Adom TV on November 26, 2025, Dr Beyuo said the review uncovered instances where Zipline allegedly used its drones to deliver non-essential items such as condoms, uniforms and textbooks.
He claimed that the primary purpose of Ziplines services was to deliver essential medical supplies to hard-to-reach areas, yet the company was only serving 12 percent of facilities in those communities.
'Bogus report'
But Dr Amoakoh maintained that the narrative being circulated is misleading. She explained that part of the review referenced a study conducted by Prof Kenu of the School of Public Health, which noted shortages of certain medical commodities at Zipline distribution centres.
However, she stressed that these shortages were the result of inadequate supplies at the regional medical stores, a responsibility of the Ghana Health Service.
It is surprising that a whole professor is spinning this study for political reasons and personal gain, she said, questioning the motives behind the interpretation of the findings.
She further described the report being used to justify potential policy reversals as absolutely bogus, arguing that it is merely another excuse to undermine a system that has proven effective.
This is just another cheap excuse for the minister to drag us centuries back, cancel the project, and create room for their own interests, simply because there is no chop chop for them  just like we saw with LLIMS, she stated.
She warned that attempts to roll back successful innovations in the health sector would ultimately hurt citizens who depend on timely medical deliveries, especially in difficult-to-access areas.
Ziplines report
According to Ziplines report, it operations have demonstrated significant impact and cost-effectiveness: facilities supported by Zipline in the Ashanti Region saw a 56% reduction in maternal mortality, while antenatal visits increased by 20% due to improved product availability and public confidence.
Across Ghana, routine immunization rates rose by 21 percentage points, and Zipline-supported facilities spent 58% less on product pickup compared to non-supported facilities.
The cost per additional fully immunized child was just $0.66, making Zipline more cost-effective than other vaccination interventions.
Crucial role
She also emphasised the crucial role Zipline plays in Ghanas healthcare infrastructure, stating that the company delivers essential medical supplies that save lives, expand access, and strengthen the national health system.
She noted that Zipline delivers products that are requested by healthcare providers and are supplied and authorized by the Government of Ghana.
She clarified that among the millions of products delivered, condoms account for only one in every 20,000 deliveries, a tiny fraction of the total products delivered.
She explained that these deliveries occur only when government health facilities request them and are part of standard public health supply chains.
According to her, Zipline serves more than 3,100 health facilities and community health worker drop sites, reaching over 19 million Ghanaians with hundreds of deliveries every day.
She added that through this extensive network, millions of people have immediate access to a world-class, on-demand pharmacy, whether for emergency medicines, vaccines, blood products, family planning commodities or other essential items provided by the government.
Dr Amoakoh mentioned that over the last six years, in partnership with the Government of Ghana, Zipline has delivered measurable and independently validated improvements in healthcare outcomes.
She stated that the company has contributed to a 56.4 percent reduction in maternal mortality in supported districts, a twenty-two-fold increase in access to essential health products, a 60 percent reduction in medicine stockouts, and 60 percent fewer referrals to distant facilities due to lack of supplies.
Public-private partnership
She attributed these achievements to a strong, collaborative public-private partnership designed to strengthen Ghanas health system and serve communities across the country.
Dr Amoakoh further explained that Zipline operates six distribution centers in Omenako, Mpanya, Vobsi, Sefwi Wiawso, Anum and Krachi, distributing essential medicines, malaria medication, routine and novel childhood vaccines, emergency treatments for dog and snakebites, blood products, and livestock vaccines.
She noted that 100 percent of the products delivered by Zipline are requested by healthcare providers and provided by the government, and that the company employs over 100 trained Ghanaians in high-tech careers across the country.
Dr Amoakoh highlighted that Ziplines work has saved over 9,600 lives, including more than 1,600 from snakebites, demonstrating the companys significant impact on the health and well-being of Ghanaians.
Real impactful change
She said Ziplines operations represent real impactful change that continues to save lives and improve access to essential medical supplies, particularly in hard-to-reach communities.
According to her, since 2022, Ziplines medical drone delivery network has saved 6,341 lives through emergency deliveries, including blood products and snake antivenom. She noted that the service has become an indispensable part of Ghanas health infrastructure, bridging the gap between remote facilities and critical medical supplies.
She stated that the Government of Ghana has delivered more than 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, out of which Zipline alone transported over 2.8 million doses by drone. This, she said, demonstrates the vital role technology continues to play in Ghanas public health delivery.
Beyond the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Dr. Amoakoh mentioned that Zipline has made more than 550,000 drone deliveries nationwide. She explained that Zipline now distributes vaccines, blood and blood products, essential medicines, and diagnostic specimens to over 3,000 health facilities across Ghana, ensuring swift and reliable delivery regardless of geographical location.
She also cited Ziplines critical intervention during the Anthrax outbreak in June 2023. Working in partnership with the Veterinary Services Directorate and with support from USAID, Zipline undertook an emergency distribution of 200,000 Anthrax vaccines across 15 districts in Northern Ghana.
According to her, this rapid and effective response helped to curtail the spread of the disease and reduce its socio-economic impact, reinforcing the importance of technology-driven solutions in public health emergencies.
Boosted childhood vaccination
She noted that in areas served by Zipline, vaccination rates have increased by an average of 21 percentage points across all routine childhood vaccines. She added that health facilities relying solely on Zipline have reduced stockout durations by 60 percent, compared to those supplied through traditional means.
Facilities served by Zipline have also recorded a 42 percent reduction in missed vaccination opportunities, she said, describing the drone delivery system as a tangible example of how innovation can enhance efficiency and save lives.
She emphasised that these achievements are a testament to the foresight and leadership of Dr. Bawumia, whose commitment to digital transformation has reshaped public service delivery in Ghana.
She reiterated that under his leadership, technological innovation has not only modernized healthcare logistics but also expanded access to essential medicines and vaccines, even in the most remote areas of the country.
Dr Bawumias vision for a digitally empowered Ghana continues to bear fruit, she said, and the success of Zipline is just one of many examples showing how innovation can drive national progress and improve lives.

'Politically-procured judgement a threat to peace'  Nyama reacts to Kpandai MP case,"A leading member of the new Patriotic Party (NPP) figure, Richard Nyama, has described the Tamale High Courts order for a rerun of the Kpandai parliamentary elections as a politically procured judgement that threatens peace and stability in the constituency.
According to him, waking up to news of the ruling initially appeared to be fake news, only for subsequent checks to confirm the development.
He argued that the decision undermines the clear mandate delivered to the NPPs Matthew Nyindam in the 2024 polls.
Nyama emphasised that the Kpandai constituency has experienced a significant political shift over the past decade.
For 20 years, the seat had been a stronghold of the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) until Matthew Nyindams breakthrough victory in 2012.
He noted that the area had since evolved from a safe NDC seat to a swing constituency, and by the 2024 election results, was gradually becoming a safe seat for the NPP.
He pointed out that, for the first time, an NPP presidential candidateformer Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumiadefeated former President John Dramani Mahama in the constituency by over 500 votes.
Citing the strong performance of the NPP in both the parliamentary and presidential ballots, Nyama described the courts decision as a corrupt judgement aimed at overturning the will of the people.
He questioned why the presiding judge would seek to give what was not asked for, especially when the NDCs own petition centred on 41 polling stations which, he argues, would not have altered the final outcome even if awarded entirely to the opposition.
He referenced the Supreme Courts 2012 ruling led by Justice Atuguba, which affirmed that elections are won and lost at the polling station.
The NPP stalwart further accused the NDC of attempting to disrupt the electoral process on the day of declaration, claiming that the partys agents vandalised the collation centre upon realising they were losing, forcing election officials to move the process to the regional capital.
He cautioned that the ruling could embolden further attempts to overturn legitimate mandates if the NPPs leadership does not unite swiftly to support Nyindam and the people of Kpandai in contesting the decision.
Nyama concluded with a rallying call to NPP loyalists, warning that complacency could result in the party losing all its parliamentary seats by the end of the current administration.
He insisted that the people of Kpandai would fight this till justice is done, adding that the judiciary appeared to have been reset to kowtow to the NDC government.
He urged Nyindam to remain steadfast, assuring him of the unwavering support of his constituents and party faithful.",,Politics, 27 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Politically-procured-judgement-a-threat-to-peace-Nyama-reacts-to-Kpandai-MP-case-2011288
Nyindam will stay as MP until 7 day mandatory stay of execution expires - Bagbin rules,"The Speaker of Parliament,
Alban Bagbin
, has described as premature the claims and positions made by some members of the Majority Caucus seeking to prevent Matthew Nyindam, the Member of Parliament for Kpandai, from participating in parliamentary proceedings.
According to him, the Kpandai lawmaker, despite a court order annulling his parliamentary election and directing a rerun within 30 days, may still attend proceedings until the seven-day stay of execution of the High Court ruling expires.
'What kind of kangaroo court is this?'  Minority reacts to Kpandai election rerun
Bagbin made this known while addressing the floor of Parliament on Thursday, November 27, 2025.
This means that Nyindam will continue to serve as an MP until December 1, 2025, when the stay of execution will expire.
Honorable members, it is, therefore, premature to say that the Honorable Matthew Nyindam is disqualified from entering and participating in the proceedings of the House, because this period still falls within the seven days' mandatory stay of execution of the order.
Honorable members, this is not a declaratory order, it is an executive order that was delivered by the High Court, and so the Honorable Member is right to have been in the House yesterday and to have participated in the proceedings, he said.
During proceedings on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, Nyindams attempt to participate in debates was opposed by the Majority Chief Whip,
Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor
, who argued that, in line with the courts ruling and the law, Nyindam can no longer be recognised as a member of the House.

NPP Primaries: 63% of 'die-hard' NPP members rooting for Bawumia - Poll,"Former Vice President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, was reported by the Global InfoAnalytics this week, as having maintained a national lead in its latest survey on the NPP Primaries.
According to the poll, Dr Bawumia was leading his other competitors in 14 out of 16 regions, and was also ahead nationally with 42%, while
Kennedy Agyapong
was at second with 18% and as much as 34% of respondents being either undecided or unwilling to disclose their preference.
NPP Primaries: Bawumia stretches lead, projected to win 15 out of 16 regions in new poll
Nonetheless, one other key finding the Global InfoAnalytics latest survey reported was how Dr Bawumia was totally favored among the NPP's core supporters, or die-hards.
Using what it called the committed voters' model, Global InfoAnalytics reported that 63%, of committed NPP voters favored Dr Bawumia, while 29% of such voters were for
Kennedy Agyapong
.
Dr Bryan Acheampong has 7% while Dr
Yaw Osei Adutwum
had 1%, Kwabena Agyepong had 0.
Committed Voters, as Global InfoAnalytics explained, ""are delegates who have mentioned a candidate by name and committed to vote for that candidate.""
Reporting on the  model, Global InfoAnalytics noted that it excluded the ""undecided and those who don't openly disclose their vote.""
From Central to Eastern Region: Bawumia's relentless 'Journey Together to Victory' continues
Being extremely popular among committed voters comes as a huge boost to Dr Bawumia, as committed voters model, in political surveys, represents hard-core supporters who will not change their mind and would even go a step further to influence votes for their preferred candidate.

Watch as Dafeamekpor blocks debate attempt by disputed Kpandai MP in Parliament,"It was another tense session on the floor of Parliament during the sitting on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, when a debate on the annulment of the Kpandai election arose.
The disputed Member of Parliament for Kpandai,
Matthew Nyindam
, appeared in Parliament and attempted to participate in debates in the House.
However, his attempt was opposed by the Majority Chief Whip,
Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor
, who argued that, per the courts ruling and laws, Nyindam can no longer be recognised as a member of the House.

Mr Speaker, ipso facto, the Honorable Nyindam is no longer a member of this House. Hes not. By operation of law, hes no longer a member of this House with a voice.""
Dafeamekpor, in his submission, contended that Nyindams appeal of the courts ruling does not mean the ruling is paused or put on hold.
He argued that the courts decision still stands unless a separate order is issued to stop it.
The South Dayi lawmaker added that once the House has been served with the courts decision, it is bound by law to comply with and adhere to the directive accordingly.
Mr Speaker, by operation of law, the Honorable Nyindam can no longer participate in our proceedings. If he's minded to appeal the decision of the High Court, it is his right, and he has done so but it is right that mere filing of an appeal does not operate as a stay of execution of the court's orders, he stated.
He continued, ... there are two processes involved here. I have seen both copies. He has filed a notice of appeal. It does not operate as a stay against the execution of the orders of the High Court in Tamale. A mere filing of a stay of execution application also does not operate as a stay against the execution of the orders of the court. So, Parliament, having been duly served, has a duty under law to ensure that the Honorable Nyindam is no longer extended by the House as extended to members.
He insisted that, as there are no contrary orders from the courts against the earlier ruling, he will ensure that the courts orders are observed and obeyed, urging the Minority side to address their grievances with the courts.
'Kpandai seat must be declared vacant'  Majority to Speaker Bagbin
Mr Speaker, there is no contrary order from the High Court, properly constituted, nor the Court of Appeal. Staying that order of the High Court, and me as the Majority Chief Whip of this side, we will not sit and disobey the Court... We will observe the orders of the court. If you are minded, the tournament for doing so is in the courtroom.
Matthew Nyindam
, the disputed MP, has filed an appeal seeking a stay of execution against the ruling of the High Court in Tamale.
His appeal also challenges the courts verdict and seeks to temporarily halt the rerun pending the outcome of the appeal.

Dr Opoku Prempeh calls for support for the vulnerable during festive period,"Presidential running mate of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) in the 2024 general elections and former Minister for Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has called on Ghanaians to renew their commitment to compassion and support for the vulnerable as the Christmas season approaches.
Drawing inspiration from Scripture, he noted that God reveals His heart through the divine titles He bears  the Father of the fatherless and Protector of Widows. These names, he said, remind society of its moral responsibility to uphold the dignity of the weak and extend care to those who depend on communal support.
According to Dr Opoku Prempeh, true leadership is anchored in service.
A just society must look after the vulnerable and never turn its back on those who need help the most, he emphasised.
He praised institutions such as the Kumasi Cheshire Home, the Kumasi Childrens Home, and the Edwenase Rehabilitation Centre for their longstanding dedication to children, the elderly, and persons with special needs.
He encouraged the public, especially during the festive seasonto extend support to these homes, which continue to embody the spirit of service and hope.
During his visit to the Kumasi Rehabilitation Centre, administrators lamented the burden of high electricity bills affecting their operations.
In response, Dr Opoku Prempeh donated GH5,000 to settle the Centres electricity expenses from now through the Christmas period. He also presented assorted food items, including:
Bags of rice
Bags of beans
Bags of gari
Boxes of oil
Boxes of canned fish
Boxes of canned tomatoes
These donations, he noted, were meant to ease the pressure on the Centre and ensure that the residents enjoy a more dignified and fulfilling festive season.
As we prepare to celebrate the season, let us remember that we are called to be stewards of one another. Let us be instruments of care and compassion to the vulnerable among us, he appealed.
Dr Opoku Prempeh reaffirmed that leadership is not only about policy and governance but also about embodying values that uplift communities and strengthen the bonds that hold the nation together.

Ayew Afriye exposes 'high-level inconsistencies' in goverment's 2026 health budget,"Ranking Member of the
Parliament
ary Health Committee, Dr
Nana Ayew Afriye
, has taken a strong swipe at the NDC government, accusing it of high-level inconsistencies in its 2026 Budget Statement as presented by Finance Minister Dr
Cassiel Ato Forson
.
Contributing to the budget debate in
Parliament
, Dr Ayew Afriye said the ministers claims of expanding access to healthcare under the Mahama Care initiative sharply contradict the governments own fiscal actionsparticularly regarding the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF).
He quoted the ministers assertion: Mr Speaker, the National Health Insurance Scheme has been uncapped to provide financing for vaccines, essential commodities, HIV services and Free Primary Health Care under the Mahama Care initiative.
According to the Ranking Member, this statement does not reflect the real situation on the ground. He revealed that last year, although GH8 billion was allocated to the NHIF, the amount was capped at GH6.8 billion, and ultimately only GH6.5 billion was releasedrepresenting about 95.5 percent.
Dr Ayew Afriye argued that this years figures present even deeper contradictions. He noted that the projected NHIF envelope of GH10 billionlater revised to GH8 billionwas again subjected to a further 20 percent cap to fund the Mahama Care Trust. This, he explained, translates to about GH1.6 billion being withheld, significantly reducing the funds available to the NHIA.
Mr Speaker, if this pattern persists, about GH6.4 billion will eventually be released to the NHIAa drastic drop from last year and a clear indication of inconsistency in the governments budget narrative, he said.
The Ranking Member further demanded clarity from the government on the true scope of the Mahama Care initiative and the Primary Health Care programme.
He stated: Mr Speaker, they said they have capped about 20 percent of the GH8 billion budget and allocated it to Primary Health Care under the so-called Mahama Care. This is confusing because they also claim Mahama Care is for specialist treatment and non-communicable diseases. Which is which? The government must come clear.
Dr Ayew Afriye concluded that these contradictions undermine the ministers claims of expanded healthcare access, insisting the actual allocations point to a contraction rather than an improvement in health sector financing.

'What kind of kangaroo court is this?'  Minority reacts to Kpandai election rerun,"The Minority Leader in
Parliament
, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, has sharply criticised the Tamale High Courts decision ordering a rerun of the Kpandai parliamentary election.
Speaking to journalists in
Parliament
on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, he described the ruling as legally unsound and deeply troubling.
High Court orders rerun of Kpandai parliamentary election
Hes fixed a date for judgment, no matter what; hes supposed to deliver a judgment, yet he decided to stay away from determining the matter because a party decided belatedly to file a notice of withdrawal of the case, Afenyo-Markin lamented.
He argued that the courts subsequent directive for a complete rerun of all 152 polling stations defies ordinary legal reasoning.
The Effutu MP further alleged that the NDC candidate and his supporters were aware of the judgment in advance.
Kpandai MP speaks on High Court's election rerun decision
The NDC candidate and his supporters were aware of the judgment before the day, to the extent that on the day of the set judgment, the regional minister led a team of NDC party faithfuls into the courtroom, anticipating the expected results, the result that they were going to have judgment in their favour. The judge, who spent minutes, walked out of the courtroom claiming that his judgment would be ready on Friday. Meanwhile, in less than 24 hours, a court order was being sent to
Parliament
and Honorable Nyindam, Afenyo-Markin alleged.
Questioning the integrity of the process, the Minority Leader asked, What kind of kangaroo judicial system do we have now in Ghana?
He also warned that actions by the judiciary could threaten national stability.
The judiciary must know that their actions and inactions to serve the interests of whoever their paymaster is have the tendency of destroying our peaceful republic, he said.
Afenyo-Markin stressed that the Minority would not be silenced.
We will not mince words. They can conspire to call us one by one for a so-called contempt of court. We are criticising their shameful conduct. We are not afraid. We are ready to be in Nsawam for their so-called contempt. The world will see their disgraceful conduct. We will not sit aloof and allow them to undermine the very rule of law that they are supposed to protect. How can a judge who calls himself a judge sit in court and misconduct himself in such a manner? he added.
The Tamale High Court had ordered a rerun of the Kpandai parliamentary election within 30 days from Monday, November 24, 2025.
The ruling followed a petition filed by the 2024 National Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentary candidate, Daniel Nsala Wakpal, who challenged the validity of the 2024 election results.

Here's how much Ghana pays anytime President Mahama and his vice use his brother's jet",,Politics, 26 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/What-kind-of-kangaroo-court-is-this-Minority-reacts-to-Kpandai-election-rerun-2011160
How Naa Torshie's withholding of funds to MMDAs undermined development efforts,"Official correspondences obtained from the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development (MLGDRD) and the Ministry of Finance under the
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
administration reveal how the two Ministries, together with Ghana's development partners, engaged with the then Administrator of the District Assemblies Common Fund, Irene Naa Torshie, over her refusal to release funds to Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) for local development.
'We will expose your mismanagement of Common Fund'  Former MCE to Naa Torshie
The correspondences consist of two letters: one from the then Local Government Minister, Dan Botwe, to
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
reporting the Common Fund Administrators refusal to disburse approved funds to districts; and the second, from the Ministry of Finance, reminding the Common Fund Administrator of the urgent need to release the funds.
The details of these letters contradict claims by Irene Naa Torshie that the Akufo-Addo government did not approve funds for her office and that all her appeals, including those to Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, were ignored.
At a recent press conference the former Common Fund Administrator accused her former bosses of withholding funds.
The President, Nana Akufo-Addo and Bawumia refused to release the common funds to me. Every fund approved by Parliament was disbursed according to the laid-down formula, Naa Torshie said.
However, the official documents from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development show that monies were indeed approved and released. It was instead Naa Torshie, as Administrator of the Common Fund, who refused to make the disbursements, prompting official correspondences from both Ministries directing her to make urgent disbursements to concerned MMDAs.
Greater Accra NPP disassociates itself from chairman's statement on Naa Torshie Addo
Dan Botwe Writes to Akufo-Addo
On July 10, 2023, the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development, in a letter signed by Minister Dan Botwe, wrote to President Akufo-Addo expressing concern over the Common Fund Administrator's refusal to disburse approved funds to district assemblies.
The Ministry would want to bring to the attention of His Excellency the President, some challenges being faced in the utilisation of the District Assemblies Common Fund for the development of the District Assemblies as a result of lack of cooperation from the Office of the District Assemblies Common Fund Administrator, the letter stated.
The letter highlighted a total lack of cooperation from Naa Torshie and how her conduct negatively impacted the work of MMDCEs, halting development at the local level. Following this letter, the Ministry sent another reminder to the Common Fund in December 2023, which was also ignored, according to subsequent correspondence from the Ministry of Finance.
Finance minister Amin Adam expresses concern
Six months after the local Government Ministry reported the matter to the President, and two months after its follow-up letter, the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Common Fund Administrator expressing serious concern over her conduct.
We are in receipt of a copy of a letter dated 12th December 2023 by which the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development (MLGDRD) requested the Office of the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF) to transfer an amount of GH181,837,022.00, GH 170,142,722.00 to the sub-consolidated accounts of the Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies and  GH11,694,300 to the DPAT Secretary for the implementation of DPAT VI activities (copy of letter attached), the letter, signed by Minister of Finance Dr Mohammed Amin Adam, stated.
The finance minister further expressed concern that the refusal to release the funds stalled development activities in 2023.
We have noted with concern that these funds have since not been received in the accounts of the beneficiaries to facilitate the implementation of DPAT VI activities in 2023. This is hindering the progress of work and effective operations of the MMDAs, the Ministry added.
Development partners threaten withdrawal of support
The finance ministry noted that Naa Torshies actions had raised serious concerns among Ghana's development partners, whose financial support for local development was being held up.
The Ministry has received concerns from our Development Partners on the delayed transfer of funds to MMDAs as planned. This situation is worrying and threatens the current and future DP support to the DACF-RFG.
The Ministry further stated that the Swiss Government was reluctant to execute a new grant financing agreement of CHF 22 million, of which CHF 6 million is meant for DPAT VII activities in 2024, due to the fact that the CHF 4 million they disbursed in December 2022 plus the corresponding GOG contribution for implementation of DPAT VI activities in 2023 have not been transferred to the MMDAs.
The finance ministry warned that Ghana risked losing external support for local development due to the refusal of the Common Fund Administrator to release approved funds.
Naa Torshie faces criticism
Naa Torshie has faced strong criticism from
New Patriotic Party
members for her role in frustrating district-level development, which many say negatively affected the partys electoral fortunes. While she has campaigned for NPP members to elect Kennedy Agyapong as the party's next flagbearer, she has accused her former bosses, President Akufo-Addo and Vice President Bawumia, of failing to support her.
The official documents now reveal that it was her office that obstructed the district assemblies, potentially exacerbating public sentiment against her.

Kennedy Agyapong vows to beat Nkrumah's infrastructure legacy,"Former Member of Parliament for Assin Central and flagbearer hopeful of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP),
Kennedy Agyapong
, has declared his ambition to outdo Ghanas first president, Dr
Kwame Nkrumah
, in the area of infrastructure development if given the opportunity to lead the nation.
Speaking in a recent interview shared on X on Tuesday, November 25, 2025, Agyapong described Nkrumah as his role model and praised the visionary projects undertaken during his presidency.
He emphasised that despite Ghanas relatively small population at the time, Nkrumahs initiatives remain relevant to the countrys current needs.
If given the opportunity to lead Ghana, my goal is to surpass the records of Dr
Kwame Nkrumah
, who remains my role model. When he was president, Ghanas population was only 4 million, yet his vision and the projects he undertook continue to serve our current population of over 33 million. That is the kind of foresight I aspire to bring to our nations development, he stated.

He pointed to the universities, senior high schools, and the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital as enduring examples of Nkrumahs vision.
Despite identifying with the UP Tradition, Agyapong acknowledged Nkrumahs remarkable achievements and stressed that his own ambition is to surpass those records by focusing on development.

Kwame Nkrumah
made remarkable use of Ghanas lands to build universities, senior high schools, and even the Korle Bu Hospital. For me, he remains great.

Ntim Fordjour slams President Mahama over delay in appointing defence minister,"Assin South MP and Ranking Member on
Parliament
s Defence and Interior Committee, Reverend John Ntim Fordjour, has condemned President Mahamas decision to delay appointing a Defence Minister until 2026, saying it is reckless and a threat to national security.
Speaking on Joy FM on November 25, 2025, Ntim Fordjour said the delay is risky at a time when Ghana is dealing with serious security pressures.
President Mahama shares when he will appoint defence, environment ministers
It is very unfortunate on the part of President Mahama. Deferring the appointment of a substantive Defence Minister indefinitely to 2026 is reckless, it is dangerous, and it puts national security at risk, he said.
He pointed out that Ghana is currently facing a mix of security challenges, from violent extremism and terrorism threats to a well-organised galamsey network equipped with advanced weapons.
Ntim Fordjour also referenced the Gbenyiri conflict, which has displaced more than 48,000 people.
He noted that 23,000 of them are now refugees, with 10,000 in Burkina Faso and 13,000 in Cote dIvoire.
In the midst of the sub-regional geopolitics and the threats we face, and in the midst of the heightened insecurity we face currently, I dont know what else the President is waiting for before he prioritises our security, he stated.
President Mahama insists there is no need to rush the process of appointing a Defence Minister. Mahama noted that appointments to replace the late Defence and Environment Ministers will be made in 2026 after the 2025 Christmas season.
Speaking at the Jubilee House on November 25, during a courtesy call by the Ghana Muslim Mission, the President addressed public speculation about the vacant positions, which became available after the August 6, 2025, helicopter crash that claimed the lives of both ministers and six others.

'We will expose your mismanagement of Common Fund'  Former MCE to Naa Torshie,"Former Suhum Municipal Chief Executive, Margaret Darko, has warned that Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) are prepared to expose former District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF) Administrator, Irene Naa Torshie Addo, over how she allegedly treated them during her tenure.
According to a report by adomfmonline.com, she made the remarks on Adom FMs Dwaso Nsem on Tuesday, November 25, 2025.
Greater Accra NPP disassociates itself from chairman's statement on Naa Torshie Addo
I want her to know that we, the MMDCEs, are ready to expose her because of how she treated us,"" she remarked.
Margaret Darko also alleged unfair distribution of the Common Fund under Naa Torshies leadership.
Naa Torshies working team members disown her for switching to Kennedy Agyapongs camp
Every assembly is supposed to get about GH1.2 million, but she gave some assemblies GH4 million, others GH1.2 million, and some GH1,220,000. That alone shows she had her own interests, she claimed.
She also urged members of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) not to be swayed by what she described as Naa Torshies attempts to tarnish the image of some party leaders.
Whatever Naa Torshie is claiming to dirty some party leaders, I am urging the NPP not to pay attention to her rants. We must vote for Dr Bawumia in the 2026 flagbearership contest.
The NPP should remember the good things we did while in power and vote for the party to return and save the country again, she explained.
Margaret Darko insisted that Naa Torshie should stop attributing challenges under the DACF to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.
I want to tell Naa Torshie that she should stop blaming Bawumia. When she was buying fertiliser, when she awarded ten-seater toilet projects in Accra, and all the other things she did, she used her own means to award those contracts, she argued.
She emphasized that she would not publicly tarnish the partys image as she claims Naa Torshie is doing.
She should think about what I have said. I will not wash NPP linen in public the way she is washing her dirty linen out there, Margaret Darko stated.
Her remarks follow responses from Irene Naa Torshie Addo, who dismissed claims that she contributed to the NPPs defeat in the 2024 general elections.
Speaking to the media, Naa Torshie said it was unfair to accuse her of withholding funds from MMDCEs. She explained that the responsibility for releasing the money did not lie with her.
The President, Nana Akufo-Addo, and Bawumia refused to release the Common Funds to me. Every fund approved by Parliament was disbursed according to the laid-down formula, she said.

NPP Minority raises concerns over sanitary pads expenditure in budget,"The
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) Minority Caucus in
Parliament
has accused the government of profligate spending under the Free Sanitary Pad policy for schoolgirls in basic and senior high schools.
Addressing the
Parliament
ary Press Corps in Accra on Tuesday, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, the NPP Member of
Parliament
for Old Tafo, cited figures from the 2025 and 2026 budget statements to back the Caucus concerns.
He explained that in the 2025 budget, the government announced plans to purchase 3.1 million packs of sanitary pads at a cost of GH292 million.
However, in the 2026 budget estimates, the government reported that the same amount of GH292 million was spent to procure 6.6 million packs.
Mr Assafuah said a simple calculation based on the total number of pads purchased implied that the government procured each pack at about GH45, far above the prevailing market price, ranging between GH15 and GH25.
The Old Tafo legislator thus described the procurement as Choobo, meaning wasteful, and urged the media to interrogate the expenditure on the free sanitary pads policy.
He stressed that while the Minority Caucus supported initiatives that promote menstrual hygiene and access to education for girls, the government must ensure transparency and value for money in its procurement processes.
The Free Sanitary Pad policy in Ghana was launched in April 2025 to provide free sanitary pads to schoolgirls from Primary Five through Senior High School nationwide, aimed at improving menstrual hygiene, reducing absenteeism, and promoting gender equality.",,Politics, 25 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/NPP-Minority-raises-concerns-over-sanitary-pads-expenditure-in-budget-2011008
Dr Ayew Afriye raises alarm over government's failure to prevent Zipline shutdown,"The Ranking Member on the Health Committee of
Parliament
, Dr
Nana Ayew Afriye
, has expressed deep concern over what he describes as governments worrying inaction in preventing the decommissioning of several Zipline medical drone distribution centres across the country.
Zipline, which has become a critical component of Ghanas emergency health delivery system, transports blood and other essential medical supplies to hard-to-reach communities. But according to Dr Ayew Afriye, the company is now being forced to scale down operations due to the governments inability to settle
accumulated debts.
'We know why we lost election 2024, stop blaming Dr Bawumia'  Dr Ayew Afriye
Speaking during the debate on the 2026 Budget Statement presented by the Minister of Finance, Dr Cassiel Ato Forson, the Effiduase-Asokore legislator questioned why an administration that came into office on the promise of resetting the nation would allow such a vital health service provider to face operational collapse.
GAF failed in public health risk assessment during recruitment stampede - Dr Ayew Afriye
As we speak now, the government owes Zipline about GH175 million, yet only GH120 million was allocated in the 2026 budget. This action is clearly intended to frustrate Zipline and gradually pave the way for decommissioning, he stated.
Dr Ayew Afriye revealed that three distribution centres  with designations 4, 5 and 6  have already been affected. He added that the Anum Distribution Centre has been fully decommissioned, cutting off emergency blood supply to the entire Volta Region, parts of the Eastern Region, and the Afram Plains.
He further disclosed that the situation is equally dire in the western corridor. The Sefwi Wiawso Distribution Centre, which serves the Western North Region, the wider Western Region, parts of the Central Region, and sections of the Ashanti Region, is also shutting down.
In addition, he noted that the Krachi Distribution Centre is being closed, a development he says will affect parts of the Savannah Region and all of the Oti Region and additional sections of the Afram Plains.
The Ranking Member warned that the governments continued failure to honour its financial obligations to Zipline poses catastrophic risks to public health.
Mr Speaker, people are going to die as a result of governments inability to pay this critical service provider. Is this what we call resetting Ghana? he questioned.
Dr Ayew Afriye urged the government to immediately settle Ziplines outstanding arrears in order to restore full operations and avert preventable deaths, stressing that drone-delivered blood services have saved countless lives, especially in rural communities.

Minority challenges High Court decision on Kpandai election,"The Minority Caucus in
Parliament
has raised concerns over the High Court ruling that annulled the 2024 parliamentary election in the Kpandai Constituency, insisting that the process was transparent and the outcome reflected the will of the people.
In a statement issued on Monday, November 24, 2025, the caucus reiterated that the election was conducted in a credible manner and that the facts leading to the declaration had been properly verified.
Court throws out NDC injunction, orders EC to re-collate Ablekuma North election results
""The Minority Caucus wishes to clarify the facts surrounding the 2024 parliamentary election in the Kpandai Constituency and recent developments that have followed. The records show a transparent process, a credible declaration, and a result that reflected the will of the people. It is important for the public to have a full understanding of what occurred before, during and after the collation,"" it noted.
The Minority explained that the public deserves clarity on events before, during, and after the collation, given the tensions that arose on election day.
Kpandai MP speaks on High Court's election rerun decision
According to the caucus, supporters of the National Democratic Congress (NDC)
Parliament
ary Candidate, Daniel Nsala Wakpal, attempted to disrupt the collation after arriving at the centre in a Mahindra pickup, alleging that the Electoral Commission lacked the required pink sheets to declare the results.
""Daniel Nsala Wakpal, gathered a group of supporters who arrived at the collation centre in a Mahindra pickup wearing NDC T-shirts. They damaged some ballot boxes in an attempt to interrupt the collation, believing that the Electoral Commission would not have the pink sheets required to complete the declaration,"" it said.
It further argued that the courts ruling did not align with the evidence presented.
The Minority Caucus maintained that even if all 500 votes reportedly contested were awarded to the NDC candidate, the outcome of the election would not have changed, as the margin of victory exceeded 3,000 votes.
""Wakpal realised that he had lost the election, he refused to go to Tamale for the collation. The Electoral Commission continued with its work and declared Hon Mathew Nyindam the winner with 27,947 votes, while Hon Nsala secured 24,213 votes,"" it stated.
A High Court in Tamale nullified the parliamentary election results in Kpandai and ordered a rerun in the entire constituency.
Meanwhile, the incumbent Member of
Parliament
, Matthew Nyindam, has filed a notice of appeal and a stay of execution to challenge the ruling, expressing confidence that the appellate process will restore the mandate delivered by the people of Kpandai.

Addressing party supporters and delegates during an engagement as part of his flagbearership campaign, the former Education Minister indicated that politics should not merely revolve around slogans and party colours, but must serve as a vehicle for social and economic transformation.
""Politics must impact lives. If our leadership does not improve the living conditions of the people, then we have failed, Dr Adutwum stated.
Ghanaians deserve leadership that solves problems, expands opportunities, and creates a future of hope for every family.

He highlighted education, innovation, and human capital development as key pillars of his vision for national progress, noting that Ghanas greatest resource is its people.
According to him, strategic investments in skills development, job creation, and technology will dramatically improve livelihoods and accelerate national development.
Dr Adutwum argued that leadership must go beyond promises, pointing out that effective governance requires courage, vision, and the ability to implement policies that address poverty, unemployment, and inequality.
He stressed that his track record in the education sector demonstrates his commitment to practical, impactful solutions.
The flagbearer aspirant urged party delegates to choose a leader who understands the needs of ordinary Ghanaians and has the capacity to drive transformative change.
He expressed confidence that the NPP can present a compelling agenda to the electorate if it rallies behind a candidate focused on service, development, and unity.",,Politics, 25 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/NPP-Flagbearership-Race-Politics-must-impact-lives-Dr-Osei-Adutwum-2010977
'NDC will definitely win back the seat'  Eric Adjei on Kpandai rerun,"The Deputy Communications Officer of the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC), Eric Adjei, has said the party is confident of reclaiming the Kpandai parliamentary seat in what is expected to be a rerun, following an order by a High Court.
In an adomonline.com report on November 25, 2025, Adjei said the courts decision must be respected and described it as an opportunity for the NDC to reclaim the seat.
The law is the law, and the law has been applied. NDC will definitely win back the seat because our footprints are all over the constituency, he said.
'I will win Kpandai seat again if there's a rerun'  NPP MP
Adjei also challenged the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), claiming that the NDCs influence in the area is so strong that even if an NDC member contested the NPPs chairmanship race, that person would easily win.
He added that Ghanaians have become more politically aware due to the economic hardships experienced under the NPP administration, insisting that any by-election or rerun would favour the NDC.
Ghanaians now understand the economy and how the NPP mismanaged it. Governance is about the people, and President John Mahama is a grassroots person here to make the country great again, he indicated.

Majority of NPP delegates believe a candidate deserves a second chance to win - Poll,"With the New Patriotic Party (NPP) January 31, 2026 primary approaching, Global InfoAnalytics has released a survey reflecting the views of party faithful on the upcoming polls.
Former Vice President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, who led the party in the 2024 election, is seeking to be retained as the flagbearer for the 2028 election.
He faces competition from four other aspirants: Kennedy Agyapong, Dr Osei Yaw Adutwum, Dr Bryan Acheampong, and Kwabena Adjei Agyapong.
Bawumia in a clear lead - Global Info Analytics polls suggest
However, the latest survey released on November 25, 2025, indicates that a majority of NPP delegates believe giving a candidate a second opportunity to contest the presidency could enhance the partys chances of winning.
""In what could be a welcome development for the former vice president, majority of NPP delegates believe that giving a candidate a second chance at the ballot could enhance the partys chances in the next election,"" the survey found.
The poll shows that 59% of delegates agree with the assertion that giving a candidate a second chance could improve the partys chances of winning the 2028 election, while 14% disagree, and 27% remain neutral.

The survey also noted that ""majority of delegates in all the regions except Volta Region agree with this assertion.""
In the main national polls, Dr Bawumia reportedly holds a commanding lead in 14 out of 16 regions, with Volta and Central Regions showing a tie.
The view of the majority of NPP delegates aligns with the historical practice of both the NPP and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) of retaining defeated presidential candidates until they eventually win.
The NPP, for instance, presented
John Agyekum Kufuor
twice in 1996 and 2000 before he won, and Nana Akufo-Addo three times in 2008, 2012, and 2016 before being elected president.
Similarly, the NDC presented the late
John Evans Atta Mills
three times in 2000, 2004, and 2008 before his victory. After losing the 2012 election as sitting president, John Dramani Mahama was presented again for the 2020 and 2024 elections, eventually securing victory in 2024.

First time since 1992 that Ghana has gone 9 months without a scandal  Kutor asserts,"A National Executive Committee (NEC) Member of the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC), Wonder Victor Kutor (Esq), has urged the party not to become complacent as the current government continues to perform creditably.
According to him, the governments performance has been evident not only in improvements in the economy and the general conditions of goods and services but also in the fact that, for the first time under the 4th Republic, there has not been a single scandal associated with the government within its first nine months.
Speaking at the End-of-Year and Welcome Party held in the United Kingdom in honour of Ghanas new High Commissioner to the UK, Zita Sabah Benson and organised by the NDC UK/Ireland chapter of the party, Kutor encouraged the government to maintain its composure and strong performance as the party prepares its reorganisation next year in accordance with the partys constitution.
He added that the governments clean record and steady performance are also reflections of a similar successful reorganisation of the party following its loss of power in 2016.
Kutor, who is also a Board Member of the Volta River Authority (VRA), called for stronger collaboration and a more effective working relationship between the party and the government.
As you may know, the NDC constitution requires the party to reorganise next year. I know many of you would want to take part. It is my advice that you go about the process with decency and dignity so that you do not disrupt government activities and programmes, he cautioned.
He further urged the leadership of the NDC UK/Ireland Chapter to carefully manage the zoning of party activities to avoid undermining the main chapter.
I have taken judicial notice of the Northern, Middle Belt and Southern zones. They are all good initiatives, but let me caution that these must not affect the unity of the chapter, he stressed.
Wonder Kutor also highlighted some of the achievements and fulfilled campaign promises made by the government.
These included the payment of No Stress Fees, limiting ministerial appointments to a maximum of 60, and the current stability in the power sector, a development he attributed to the discipline and leadership of the Minister of Energy and Green Transition, John Jinapor.", Patrick Biddah,Politics, 25 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/First-time-since-1992-that-Ghana-has-gone-9-months-without-a-scandal-Kutor-asserts-2010899
Dr Opoku Prempeh defends remarks about 'God sleeping at night',"New Patriotic Party
(NPP) running mate for the 2024 presidential election, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh (NAPO), has defended a claim he made in the run-up to the election that the 24-Hour Economy policy proposal of the NDC was not possible because even God sleeps at night.
Speaking in an interview on JoyNews on November 24, 2025, NAPO said that the statement he made was a fact but he was chastised for making it.
He explained that Christians believe Jesus is God, and it was recorded in the Bible that Jesus slept, which makes his assertion valid.
People ridiculed me when I said God sleeps. But if you are a Christian and you believe in the Bible and you know the Trinity... then you know that God made himself manifest and came to live amongst us for 33 years, through a divine birth.
And it was the same Bible that said when there was a storm, and the apostles went to Jesus, he was fast asleep. Tell me, was Christ not God? he is quoted to have said in a news card by JoyNews from the interview.
There is no country in the world where people work for 24 hours; even God sleeps at night - NAPO
What NAPO said:
NAPO took a swipe at the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) over its major campaign policy for the 2024 poll, the 24-Hour Economy proposal.
Speaking at a campaign event in Accra on September 24, 2024, NAPO asserted that the NDCs 24-Hour Economy policy is impossible.
He claimed that there is no country in the world where people work for 24 hours.
The 2024 NPP running mate indicated that people have to rest after work because even God, who created the universe, rests.
It is not possible. There is no country in the world where people work for 24 hours; even God, who created the world, rests at night, NAPO, who is also the Member of Parliament (MP) for Manhyia South, said in Twi.

'I will win Kpandai seat again if there's a rerun'  NPP MP,"The Member of
Parliament
for Kpandai,
Matthew Nyindam
, has stated that he is unmoved by the High Court ruling that annulled the 2024 parliamentary election in his constituency, insisting he would easily return to
Parliament
if a rerun is held.
Speaking on Asempa FMs Ekosii Sen show, he expressed confidence that he would win again if elections were held today because the people of his constituency know his capabilities.
Im still the MP for Kpandai. What they are doing does not move me. The people of Kpandai know me. The constituency knows my capabilities, and I am confident of returning to
Parliament
, he said.
NDC reacts to Kpandai parliamentary election rerun
Matthew Nyindam
s comments follow a decision by the Tamale High Court on November 24, 2025, directing the Electoral Commission to conduct a new election within 30 days after a petition challenged the outcome of the December 7, 2024, polls.
Nyindam has responded by filing notices of appeal and a stay of execution in an effort to stop the implementation of the courts order.
In an interview on Citi FM, he insisted that the certified figures validate his victory and that he still holds the mandate of the people.
If you look at the pink sheets, it is on record that they have admitted that every single pink sheet was given to all the political parties. I have my 152, they have theirs. If you put the results together, we have won the elections. Let me put it on record that I am still their MP, he said.
While he says he trusts the legal process, he noted that he will participate fully in a rerun if the courts eventually uphold that directive.
Nyindam also claimed that the NDC is trying to use state institutions to remove him from office but maintained that he is not shaken.
I am not afraid of a rerun. If genuinely we have to run, we wont have a problem. But if you decide to pave your way through because you think you are in government and you can use state powers to coerce the people to vote for you, that is where we have a difficulty, he stated.
