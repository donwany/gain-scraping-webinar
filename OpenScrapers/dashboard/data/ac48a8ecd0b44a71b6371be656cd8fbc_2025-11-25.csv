Use reclaimed mining lands for non-edible cash crops - Dr Agyemang,"The Founder of HEPA Plus Herbal Mixture, Dr Ebenezer Agyemang, has called on the government to utilise reclaimed illegal mining lands for the cultivation of commercial non-edible cash crops to protect consumers from heavy metals.
The renowned herbal practitioner argued that these plants will help in the treatment of the land while providing jobs and revenue at the same time.
He noted that it would be dangerous for the country to allow the cultivation of edible crops on recently reclaimed mining sites.
""Research by scientists at The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, KNUST and the Crop Research Institute has proven the presence of heavy metals in foods grown at these illegal mining sites,"" he said.
""These heavy metals, which have been detected in maize, cowpea and other edible crops may find their way in meals which will be dangerous for consumption,"" Dr Agyemang added.
""My suggestion is that Ghana must reclaim all these mining sites but rather use them for the plantation of thick trees, rubber and other non-edible cash crops.""
Speaking to OTEC news on Monday, Dr Ebenezer Agyemang noted that these cash crops will not only treat the land but will create jobs for the youth.
He appealed to the government to team up with academia in this discussion and find a lasting solution to the problem.",,Regional, 24 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Use-reclaimed-mining-lands-for-non-edible-cash-crops-Dr-Agyemang-2010762
Greater Accra NPP disassociates itself from chairman's statement on Naa Torshie Addo,"The Greater Accra Regional Secretariat of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) has distanced itself from a statement issued by the Regional Chairman, Divine Otoo Agorhom, regarding
Irene Naa Torshie Addo
, a former Administrator of the District Assembly Common Fund, insisting that the release did not reflect the official position of the regional leadership.
In a clarification issued on November 23, 2025, the secretariat said its attention had been drawn to a publication circulating as though it emanated from the regional hierarchy.
It stressed that no meeting of the Regional Executive Committee, Council of Patrons, Elders, Disciplinary Committee, Finance Committee or any other body was convened to discuss or authorise any statement concerning Naa Torshie.
Paul Afoko's return to NPP a big blow to United Party - Dr Zaato
At no point was any regional leadership meeting convened to discuss or approve that statement. It was issued solely by the Regional Chairman and reflects only his personal views, the secretariat said.
According to the secretariat, the last officially held regional meeting took place on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, at the Shelter and focused on the partys Presidential Primaries and album verification.
It added that the regional chairman used part of that meeting to make what it described as unfounded remarks about Naa Torshie due to her alignment with a different internal camp.
The secretariat also rejected allegations made in the chairmans November 23 statement suggesting that Naa Torshie had claimed that Greater Accra voters withheld support in the 2024 Election because the party selected an Ashanti running mate.
We have monitored her engagements closely, and at no point did she make such a claim, directly or indirectly, the secretariat stated.
It further challenged Chairman Agorhom to provide audio, video, or transcripts to substantiate his allegations, describing the claims as baseless and inappropriate.
They also emphasised that internal party democracy guarantees every member the freedom to support any candidate of their choice without intimidation or backlash.

The statement also outlined what it said were Naa Torshie Addos extensive contributions to the regional party structure. These include funding for training programmes, research, communication activities, mobilisation drives, womens and youth wing initiatives, Nasara programmes, and logistical support for parliamentary candidates during the 2020 and 2024 elections.
It further highlighted that she is the sole financier of the ongoing construction of the partys ultra-modern regional office. Beyond party matters, the secretariat acknowledged her support for individuals undertaking religious pilgrimages to Mecca and Israel.
Concluding the statement, the secretariat apologised to her, saying, We sincerely apologise for the unwarranted and unnecessary attacks on the Mama of the region. Hon Naa Torshie Addo remains a pillar of unity, a dependable supporter, and an invaluable asset to the Greater Accra NPP.

Salaga South MP pledges comprehensive renovation of health centres,"The Member of Parliament for the Salaga South Constituency, Zuwera Mohammed Ibrahimiah, has assured her constituents of her strong commitment to improving healthcare and expanding access to potable water across the area.
Speaking at a ceremony, Ibrahimiah revealed that plans are underway to renovate all health centres in the constituency, beginning with Pigyawo and Telpa.
She noted that in 2024, the Abromase Health Centre was successfully renovated and similar upgrades will follow in other communities.
She further stated that new health facilities would be constructed in areas without clinics, in line with President Mahamas policy that every community must have a health post.
According to her, the goal is to ensure that when illness strikes, residents will no longer need to travel from places like Adevokpe to Abromase to seek medical care. Instead, each community will have its own health post, staffed with nurses to attend to patients.
Ibrahimiah also addressed the issue of water access. She explained that during her visit in December 2024, she promised to drill a borehole in every community within the constituency.
""Work on this pledge has already begun, with eight boreholes and three mechanised water systems completed so far.""
She added that although attempts to find water in Akamade and Buman were initially unsuccessful, efforts will continue until water is finally struck in those areas.
She expressed optimism that most communities are responding favourably and reaffirmed her commitment to ensuring that every community receives a borehole.

"President Mahama breaks ground for construction of 5,000-capacity auditorium","President John Dramani Mahama has broken ground for the construction of a 5,000-seat multipurpose assembly hall complex for Ghana Senior High School (GHANASCO) in Tamale.
The project, which is the first of its kind in Ghana, is to help meet the growing population needs of the school.
President Mahama and his wife, First Lady Lordina Mahama, both alumni of GHANASCO, on Saturday graced the schools 65th Anniversary Celebration in Tamale on the theme: GHANASCO at 65: A Legacy of Excellence, Inspiring Future Generations.
From a humble beginning of 70 students and a handful of teachers, the schools population has grown to 4,524 students, supported by 172 teachers and 52 non- teaching staff across six academic departments, general science, general arts, business, agriculture, home economics, and visual arts.
GHANASCO has risen to become a beacon of excellence in Ghanas educational landscape, a home of knowledge, discipline, and hope.
Construction work has also begun on an ultramodern astro turf project, which is being spearheaded by First Lady Lordina Mahama.
Other projects which are being sponsored by the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) for the school include the construction of a two-story, 12-unit classroom block to reduce congestion and promote effective living, a two-story boys dormitory block, and two 12-seater toilet facilities, and the rehabilitation and equipment of the science laboratory.
The President also commissioned a SMART Classroom Block.President Mahama, in his keynote address, said one of the major setbacks of Free Senior High School (SHS) was the lack of dedicated funding and so the nations headmasters and their staff were always frustrated because the money to run the schools always came in late and so they had to go around begging for food for the school children.
And I remember in many instances our northern schools would send an appeal to all students to bring food to feed our students that is a thing of the past now because of the dedicated funding for free SHS we are able to release the money to the schools and to the Buffer Stock Company on time so that children can be fed nutritious meals, the President stated.
However, he noted, that one of the initiatives coming up was to try and resolve the problem of the school placement system.
He said the System had run into problems because schools were categorized in three categories: A, B and C, stating that about half of the students population were in category C schools, which most people do not want.
He said the Government needed to improve the infrastructure in category C and category B schools, so that everywhere, every school would be a category A school; saying that is how it should be.
He said in the 2026 Budget Statement and Economic Policy of the Government, government was selecting the first 30 category C schools to build science laboratories, dormitories, classroom blocks, Science, Technical, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) laboratories.
This will help expand those category C schools to either category B or category A to ensure any school a child gets he would feel confident of the chance of making it into tertiary education.
The President said 30 of the abandoned E-Blocks, which started under his previous administration had been selected for completion in next years budget and that they were going to put resources in and finish all the 30 e-blocks.
With regard to the Governments policy where secondary schools will be having a poultry farm and a livestock farm, the President said GHANASCO would be one of the schools selected for the project.
We will establish a poultry farm here and a livestock farm so that you dont have to go to the market to buy your meat, you take your meat from your own farm, he said.
And so, when we have the farm, you have to be volunteering to go and feed the chickens and the sheep and goats.
And again, the headmaster will have no excuse when you go to the dining hall and theres no meat in your food. And so, well select GHANASCO as one of the early ones to participate in this programme.
Haruna Iddrisu, the Minister of Education, announced that before 31st December, 2,000 furniture would be delivered to GHANASCO and some other schools.
He said the GETFund would acquire a number of buses in 2026 and that about 50 schools, including GHANASCO, would benefit from that.
He said he was aware that a number of Headmasters were without vehicles or pickups and that the President was giving his due attention, and that the GETFund was undertaking a procurement process to get that done.
Douglas Haruna Yakubu, GHANASCO Headmaster, thanked President Mahama for giving the school a 30-seater bus.
He expressed gratitude to First Lady Lordina Mahama for building the Lordina Mahama Hall for the female students at the school.
Alhaji Ibrahim Abdul Fatawu, President of the Old GHANASCANs Association (OGA), expressed delight at the level of progress in the construction of the schools fence well.",,Regional, 24 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/President-Mahama-breaks-ground-for-construction-of-5-000-capacity-auditorium-2010716
Peace returns to Kwahu as Daasebre Agyepong II resumes traditional duty after failed palace coup,"Peace is gradually returning to Kwahu following the enforcement of an order by the Judicial Committee of the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs, which reinstated Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II to the Esono Gyimah Mampong Agyei Palace at Abene.
Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II has assured indigenes of Kwahu he will ensure reconciliation, foster unity and prioritise peace and development.
The palace had been unlawfully seized since late 2024 by armed thugs and occupied by Baffuor Akoto Osei, who had been paraded as Kwahuhene since January 2025, after an alleged destoolment of the substantive chief.
Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II, born Eugene Kwasi Asante Boadi, is a chartered accountant who was lawfully nominated, selected, and enstooled as Kwahuhene on June 5, 2017, following the passing of Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng II on September 9, 2014.
His name was duly entered into the National Register of Chiefs and gazetted on September 28, 2017.
Despite his recognition and active performance of customary and statutory functions as Kwahuhene, some kingmakers were allegedly instigated to perform rites to declare him destooled.
They claimed that Daasebre had brought disrepute to the stool following his resignation as Board Chairman of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) after allegations of financial impropriety were leveled against him by a businessman in October 2025.
Supported by some compromised divisional chiefs and invisible forces, Baffuor Akoto Osei was purportedly enstooled in January 2025 under the stool name Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng III, to replace Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II.
With the aid of heavily armed men, he occupied the Abene Palace, the traditional headquarters of the Kwahu Traditional Area, and warned Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II not to step onto the palace grounds.
However, Some Chiefs and Elders of Kwahu seriously disagree with destoolment.
For instance, Nana Kwaku Boateng, the Etena/Bretuo Abusuapanyin contends that the Chieftaincy Act (2008), Act 759, requires that a lawful process be followed before a chief can be removed hence the kingmakers acted in violation of both tradition and the Chieftaincy Act in attempting to destool Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II.
On May 5, 2025, Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II filed a motion seeking an interlocutory injunction to restrain Baffuor Akoto Osei from holding himself out as Kwahuhene.
The Judicial Committee of the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs granted the injunction, restraining Baffuor Akoto Osei and six others  the Krontihene of Abene, Nana Simpe Owiredu III; the Akyeamehene of Abene, Nana Asiedu Kwabeng IV; the Baamuhene of Abene, Nana Ntim Sampong II; the Werempehene of Abene, Baffour Nyarko Kyerefuor II; Nana Odame Ansong; and Okyeame Akuoko Boateng  from interfering in the functions and authority of Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II as Omanhene of the Kwahu Traditional Area, pending the final determination of the substantive case.
The ruling, delivered on Tuesday, June 24, 2025, at a sitting in Koforidua, was presided over by Committee Chairman Okotwaasuo Kantamanto Oworae Agyekum III, with members Oklepeme Nuer Anobaah Sasraku II and Akusiaku Brempong Kumi Sasraku VIII.
The House of Chiefs ordered that all respondents, their assigns, agents, workers, or anyone acting on their behalf must refrain from interfering with the status, duties, or activities of Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II as Kwahuhene.
It further ordered that the respondents are restrained from presenting or recognizing the 7th respondent -Baffuor Akoto Osei as Kwahuhene, and that the 7th respondent himself is restrained from holding himself out as Kwahuhene or performing any function or activity whatsoever at the Abene Palace.
On November 17, the police carried out an operation to enforce the Judicial Committee ruling, restoring Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II to the palace.
Despite initial tension, relative calm has since returned to the Kwahu Traditional Area.
Daasebre Akuamoah Agyepong II is expected to carry out his traditional and customary functions as Kwahuhene and continue his efforts to woe investors to the area for development.
Since his installation, Daasebre has demonstrated visionary and peaceful leadership even in the face of daring provocation.
He is not only President of the Kwahu Traditional Council, but also serves as Vice President of the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs and is a member and Judicial Committee member of the National House of Chiefs and also a member of the Research Committee of the National House of Chiefs.
He has held notable leadership roles in institutions such as the Agricultural Development Bank , Abosso Goldfields, and KPMG.",,Regional, 24 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Peace-returns-to-Kwahu-as-Daasebre-Agyepong-II-resumes-traditional-duty-after-failed-palace-coup-2010708
Wa Technical Institute shut down for a week following riot,"Wa Technical Institute (Wa Tech) in the Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region has been temporarily closed down for a week following disturbances by learners on Wednesday, November 19, 2025.
The unrest erupted during prep time as students were returning from classes, resulting in damage to school property, including administration offices and school buses.
Saaka Adams, Acting Regional Director of Ghana TVET and Principal of Wa Technical Institute, said the students had been traumatised by the incident.
He explained that the school would remain closed for a week to allow them to rest and recover.
Following the disturbances, Deputy Minister of Education Dr Clement Abas Apaak visited the campus on Saturday, November 22, expressing disappointment at the extent of damage.
He assured parents and guardians that the matter would be addressed to restore effective teaching and learning at the institution.
A committee has, however, been established to investigate the causes of the riot and identify those responsible.
The ministry of education emphasised that acts of indiscipline would not be tolerated and that perpetrators would face the full force of the law.
The temporary closure of Wa Tech is intended to ensure the safety of both students and staff before classes resume.",,Regional, 23 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Wa-Technical-Institute-shut-down-for-a-week-following-riot-2010696
Salaga South MP cuts sod for construction of Sawaba-Abromase Road,"The Member of Parliament for Salaga South, Hajia Zuwera Mohammed Ibrahimah, has cut sod and officially handed over the Sawaba No.1Abromase Road project to the contractor for construction.
Speaking to the media during the ceremony, Zuwera Mohammed Ibrahimah revealed that ""securing the project required persistent engagement with the Roads Minister and other key authorities.""
She explained that each time she visited the minister, he assured her that the President had raised the matter at Cabinet, while the regional minister also followed up consistently.
According to her, this collective effort made it possible to deliver one of the most important and challenging developmental projects for the area.
The MP noted that the road, when completed, will be of a standard comparable to those in Accra.
She introduced the contractor to the community and performed all necessary traditional rites to enable the immediate commencement of work.
She disclosed that the contractor has already begun concrete works around Abromase to ensure steady progress. She added that President John Dramani Mahama has sent his best wishes and pledged his full support for the project.
Zuwera emphasised that she does not view development through a political lens, stating that development has no name and must benefit everyone.
She recalled participating in the Annual Homecoming activities on 28th December after the general election, during which the community leader, one Klora, highlighted several pressing concerns, top among them was the deplorable state of the road.
She further recounted that before the election, Klora had appealed directly to the then former President Mahama, who assured the community that the road would be prioritized once he returned to office.
She assured residents that the President has not forgotten the said promise.
Addressing questions about her silence on the road in Parliament, Zuwera explained that the Roads Minister and the energy minister are both natives of the area and she therefore prefers to meet them privately to discuss concerns.
According to her, our sons and daughters are handling the issues effectively, reducing the need for repeated statements on the floor of Parliament.
She concluded by expressing gratitude to the Roads Minister and President John Dramani Mahama for taking the Sawaba No.1Abromase Road project seriously and ensuring that it finally becomes a reality for the people.

"Students, staff of Bortianor Basic Schools petition MP for urgent Infrastructure support","Students and staff of the Bortianor Basic Schools have formally petitioned the Member of Parliament for Bortianor-Ngleshie Amanfro, Felix Akwetey Okle, to intervene in what they describe as critical infrastructure and safety challenges affecting teaching and learning in the community.
The petition, signed by Eunice Ofori, Civic Education Club teacher at CFA, outlines five major concerns ranging from security and sanitation to transportation and road development.
One of the main issues raised is the absence of a fence wall around the school. According to the petitioners, the lack of proper fencing exposes students and staff to safety risks and leaves the schools land vulnerable to encroachment.
They emphasized that constructing a perimeter fence would not only protect lives and property but also create a conducive environment for academic activities.
The petition also highlights the lack of a canteen for learners. Students from both basic schools on the compound currently have no designated place to access meals.
A canteen, the petition argues, would help ensure that schoolchildren can eat nutritious meals in a hygienic environment, supporting their overall health and academic concentration.
Sanitation remains another pressing challenge. The petition requests a public solid waste dumping container with regular collection by the assembly to prevent waste accumulation.
Additionally, the petitioners are calling for the renovation or construction of new toilet facilities, alongside the employment of permanent cleaners to maintain hygiene standards in the school.
Transportation difficulties were also highlighted, with many students reportedly walking long distances due to the lack of vehicles on the BortianorRed TopNew Bortianor route.
To address this, the school is requesting an Ayalolo or Metro Mass Transit bus to transport learners safely to and from school. According to the petition, this intervention would significantly reduce absenteeism and ease the burden on students who trek long distances daily.
The petition further underscores the poor state of the road linking Bortianor to Red Top and onward to West Hills Mall. The untarred road, they said, generates excessive dust, posing serious respiratory health risks to students and residents.
The petitioners are therefore appealing for the urgent construction and asphalting of the road to improve air quality and ensure a safer environment for the community.
We believe these improvements will greatly benefit our school community and enhance our learning experience. We kindly request your support and action on these matters, the petitioners stated.

Climate Reporting: Jospong Group empowers Ghanaian journalists at COP30,"As part of its ongoing efforts to boost Ghanaian journalists' capacity for climate change reporting, the Jospong Group sponsored twenty journalists to participate in the 30th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP30).
The global climate talks took place in Belem, Brazil, from November 10 to 21, 2025, under the theme Delivering on the Paris Promise, which focused on accelerating climate action and turning commitments into concrete results.
While in Belem, the 20 journalists, selected from various media outlets, covered the Jospong Group's activities and a Ghana Day event, while gaining valuable insights into key areas including Adaptation, Cities, Infrastructure, Water, Waste, Local Governance, Bioeconomy, Circular Economy and Tourism. They also participated in sessions on Health, Sustainable Jobs, Education, Culture, Justice, Human Rights and Information Integrity.
The journalists further explored systems transformation across Energy, Industry, Transport, Trade, Finance and Carbon Markets, and engaged with discussions on Forests, Oceans and Biodiversity, where Indigenous Peoples and local communities were central. They also examined Agriculture, Food Systems, Food Security and the crucial role of Women and Gender Groups in climate action.
This marks the third time the Jospong Group has sponsored Ghanaian journalists to attend the global summit, bringing the total number supported to about 100, following COP28 in Dubai and COP29 in Baku.
The General Manager of the Jospong Green Transition Office, Ing Glenn Kwabena Gyimah (PhD), highlighted the importance of the initiative and the influential role journalists play in shaping public understanding.
Journalists need to understand climate change and its impacts to effectively share this knowledge with the public, he stated.
He further stressed that as the reality of climate change becomes more apparent, the medias voice is indispensable in the global conversation. Conferences such as COP, he added, equip media practitioners with the knowledge needed to better educate the population.
Beneficiary journalists commended the Jospong Group for its consistent support for quality media practice in Ghana, particularly in the areas of climate change, climate resilience and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG).
A senior journalist at the Daily Graphic, Timothy Ngnenbe, described the sponsorship as a step in the right direction. The environment and climate change reporter said participating in COP30 was a golden opportunity to gain practical experience that will improve their reportage.
Scientists and experts use jargon and technical language that make it difficult for the ordinary person to understand. Journalists who get the opportunity to participate in COP activities will be able to understand these technicalities and break down the complex concepts to the understanding of the masses, he said.
He urged the government to design a special programme to enable more journalists to participate in future COPs.
A News Editor at GBC Television, Alex Adi, expressed gratitude, saying, As I reflect on my journey, I'm grateful for Jospong's sponsorship to COP29 and COP30. This opportunity has given me valuable insights into climate change's global impact and world leaders' efforts to mobilise resources for mitigation and adaptation.
He noted that climate financing is the lifeblood of climate action, and commended the Jospong Groups commitment to climate mitigation through waste management and green transition partnerships.
Their efforts show that with determination and collaboration, we can drive change, he said.
The Editor of Business Week, Kofi Ahovi, described the opportunity as transformational.
The opportunity granted by Jospong Group to journalists to attend COP29 and 30 has indeed been a game-changer for many journalists, including myself, he noted. He said the experience had ignited a stronger passion for climate issues and motivated him to pursue further studies in the field.
My experience is a testament to the impact that such opportunities can have on individuals and the country as a whole. By empowering journalists with knowledge and exposure to global climate discussions, Jospong is contributing to a more informed and engaged community, he added.
For his part, the Assignment Editor and Producer at Metro TV, Derick Adottey, praised the Executive Chairman of the Jospong Group, Dr Joseph Siaw Agyepong, for equipping journalists with critical knowledge on climate change.
That he is not only equipping his staff members but also journalists in the country to understand the climate space, we must commend him for that, he said.
Adottey underscored the importance of journalists understanding climate change issues, stating, Because when journalists understand the issues of climate change at the global level, they can better appreciate and inculcate that understanding in their stories. This will also equip the public, enabling a concerted effort to tackle climate change.
He also encouraged other businesses to emulate the initiative, saying: This is a laudable initiative and I urge all businesses in the space to emulate the same.
He expressed personal gratitude, noting, Personally, I've gained so much experience and understanding by attending this conference and I thank Jospong Group for the opportunity.
The Jospong Groups initiative to sponsor Ghanaian journalists for COP30 has proven to be a significant investment in strengthening climate journalism. By providing direct exposure to global climate negotiations and critical thematic areas, the programme has equipped journalists with the essential knowledge needed for accurate and impactful reporting.
This third sponsorship underscores the Groups sustained commitment to promoting informed public dialogue on climate change in Ghana. The widespread appreciation from journalists, along with calls for more corporate support, highlights the programmes crucial role in fostering collaboration between industry and media in addressing the global climate crisis.",,Regional, 23 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Climate-Reporting-Jospong-Group-empowers-Ghanaian-journalists-at-COP30-2010673
"Prophet Jimmy reacts to Weija Junction fire, calls for continued prayer for Accra","Founder of the House of Divine Glory Church, Prophet Jimmy Alla-Mensah, has reacted to Fridays major industrial fire at the Charkieh Plastics Factory site at Weija Junction, urging continued prayer and vigilance for the Greater Accra Region following the incident.
The blaze, which erupted earlier on November 22, 2025 triggered a large-scale response from the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS). Fire crews from seven stations, including Weija, Kasoa, Anyaa, Circle, Industrial Area, Dansoman, and the National Headquarters, were deployed to contain the inferno.
The burning of plastic materials produced dense, toxic smoke, forcing firefighters to operate with specialised breathing apparatus as they worked to prevent the flames from spreading to nearby structures.
No casualties have been reported as firefighters continue battling the blaze under extremely hazardous conditions. Authorities have advised the public to steer clear of the Weija Junction area to allow emergency services full access.
In a Facebook post following the outbreak, Prophet Alla-Mensah referenced a prophetic warning he released on November 18, 2025, concerning a fiery arrows attack in the Accra area, noting that such visions may manifest anywhere within the region.
By Gods mercy, the exact target was diverted, but the manifestation still occurred within the same region, he wrote, adding that the absence of fatalities was to the glory of God.
The U.S.-based Ghanaian preacher extended prayers for continued protection over the city.
We must continue to cover the city with prayer until no programmed fire manifests again, his statement read.

Although Im very disappointed, I want to commend the MCE, the board chair, the principal, and management for moving in to secure the situation, he noted.
According to school authorities, a committee has been established to investigate the incident, which has been described as a clash involving groups of students and external collaborators.

Dr Apaak stressed that the Ministry of Education will only comment fully after the probe determines the root causes.
He added that government will not allow acts that undermine order or destroy public property.
Because we dont know the actual causes of this issue, we cannot speak in detail, save to say we expect the investigation to unravel what has caused this. As a government, as a ministry, we wont tolerate disorder, insubordination and the destruction of public property from anyone, he noted.
The visit brought together key figures including the Principal of Wa Technical Institute, Adams Saaka; the MCE, Nurah Danwanaa; Dasaana Adamu FShs; and the Upper West Regional Police Commander, DCOP Francis Yiribaare. Security presence on campus has since been reinforced as authorities work to restore calm and resume full academic activity.

"Health minister, Salaga South MP inspect abandoned 60-bed Euroget Hospital project","The Member of Parliament for Salaga South, Hajia Zuwera Mohammed Ibrahimah, together with the Minister of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, has paid a working visit to the abandoned 60-bed Euroget Salaga District Hospital.
Addressing the traditional elders of Salaga South, the health minister stated that he had earlier paid a courtesy call on the Yagbonwura before proceeding to Bole.
He stressed that his visit was not merely symbolic ahead of the upcoming funeral but a demonstration of governments commitment to resolving longstanding issues.
He expressed profound appreciation to the traditional leaders for their leadership and for mobilizing a team to clear and maintain the neglected hospital premises.
Akandoh also commended the Salaga South MP, Hajia Zuwera Mohammed Ibrahimah, for her persistent advocacy regarding the hospital project.
According to him, having served four terms in Parliament, he can easily identify a dedicated and hardworking MP and the Salaga South legislator certainly fits that description.
He revealed that the hospital project, which commenced as far back as 2010, had all its associated components completed, making its abandonment deeply unfortunate.
The minister described his visit to the site as saddening but assured the chiefs and people of the area that visible changes would soon follow.
He reiterated that it is the firm policy of the President not to abandon any inherited projects, emphasizing that he has received clear instructions to ensure their completion.
Akandoh further noted that it would be irresponsible on his part if the President were to inquire about the state of the facility and he had no knowledge of it.
He explained that he found it necessary to inspect the hospital personally so he could brief the President appropriately.
The health minister expressed gratitude for the warm reception he received, admitting that he was nearly emotional listening to the words of encouragement from the elders.
He concluded by urging them to consider him as one of their own.

Edem Ackuaku takes free NHIS registration to Akatsi South residents,"Residents of Akatsi South are set to benefit from a major social intervention as Edem Ackuaku, a prominent NDC government appointee of the Akatsi South Municipal Assembly, has rolled out a free National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) registration and renewal exercise across key communities in the constituency.
In collaboration with the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) in Akatsi South,a Ackuaku is leading a community-focused health outreach designed to remove financial and logistical barriers to accessing health insurance services, an initiative that many local leaders describe as timely, people-centered, and exemplary of responsive governance.
The exercise, which begins on Monday, November 24, 2025, at Lume, and continues through multiple communities including Ahlihadzi, Avenorpedo, Akatsi ARS, and Avenorpeme, will run from 8:00am daily and is absolutely free for all participants.
The target beneficiaries include children, adults, and the elderly.
Branches of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the area are also expected to take full advantage of the initiative, as the program specifically aims at bringing NHIS registration directly to community members, especially grassroots party executives who often serve as first responders in mobilisation and local welfare concerns.
Speaking to community members ahead of the event, Edem Ackuaku emphasised that access to healthcare documentation should not be a privilege tied to financial strength or geographical convenience.
According to him, the free NHIS registration drive forms part of his broader commitment to improving the health and social security of residents across Akatsi South.
Observers have commended the initiative as a demonstration of proactive leadership consistent with the values of the current NDC administration, noting that such interventions strengthen the social protection landscape and deepen the governments presence at the community level.
Residents are encouraged to attend the designated venues on the scheduled dates to register or renew their NHIS cards at no cost.", Japhet Festus Gbede,Regional, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Edem-Ackuaku-takes-free-NHIS-registration-to-Akatsi-South-residents-2010496
Works resume on Krobo roads after months of youth pressure,"The long-stalled SomanyaAsitey and Somanya-Kpong road projects appear to be back on track following the return of heavy machinery and personnel to the site.
A visit to the project site this week showed significant activity, with heavy machinery grading portions of the road while other equipment cleared and demolished roadside shops at Mampong, to create space for planned expansion and drainage works.
The renewed construction effort marks the most visible progress on the stretch in several months.
This development comes on the heels of persistent youth advocacy led by Kloma Hengme and the Dangme Youth for Development, who have consistently mounted pressure on authorities to revive the abandoned project.
The road works, which initially commenced in 2024, came to an abrupt halt in January 2025 due to lack of funding. The prolonged delay left commuters, drivers, and residents grappling with thick dust, worsening road conditions and daily inconveniences along the busy corridor.
Residents have welcomed the renewed activity, viewing it as a sign that the government may finally be moving to address one of the most pressing infrastructure concerns in the Yilo and Lower Manya Krobo areas.
On the government and contractors side, Project Manager at Generals Construction Limited, Billy Brigham Deku, confirmed that the firm has officially resumed work on the project. While he did not specify whether the government has released funds, he assured the public that the construction team is on-site and fully mobilised.
According to Deku, the project covers the 4.1-kilometre Somanya RoundaboutAsitey stretch, a new bypass, and the 11-kilometre Somanya RoundaboutKpong section. All components will be constructed with bitumen, and the entire project is expected to be completed by the end of 2026.
He warned that traffic disruptions are likely during the construction period and appealed for cooperation from drivers and pedestrians. Traffic is going to be a challenge, but we urge drivers and road users to cooperate, he noted.
Deku also disclosed that residents and business owners in Mampong have been asked to evacuate properties earmarked for demolition to pave the way for drainage expansion and road realignment.
However, local leaders say they expect consistent work and clear communication to ensure the project does not stall again.
Chairman of the Krobo youth coalition, Kloma Hengme, Tamatey Otu, acknowledged the renewed activity but urged caution. According to him, earlier indications of progress turned out to be temporary, fueling community frustration.
Were seeing the machines on the road to indicate that work has resumed, and as a coalition, were happy that our advocacy, demonstration and activism have yielded some impact, Otu noted. However, were a bit skeptical because on the eve of our demonstration, we saw a similar development. We were told work had resumed, but everything vanished a day after.
Otu said the community will monitor the contractors presence for consistency and transparency. Should the work continue steadily, he added, they will request a detailed briefing from the Municipal Chief Executive, the Eastern Regional Minister, and the contractor.
We want to be sure this time that the work is genuine. Once we are convinced the contractor is here to stay, we will meet with authorities for updates and offer our inputs, he said.
He stressed that residents are not seeking shortcuts but insist on durable, value-for-money workespecially as the road handles heavy industrial traffic, including limestone-hauling trucks.
The fact that we want roads to be constructed doesnt mean anything can be done. We want value for money and quality work that will withstand pressure. Durability is key, Otu emphasised.
Many community members attribute the renewed activity to public pressure, including a protest organised on October 14. Otu believes the demonstration helped accelerate government action.
Without the activism, the delays could have continued indefinitely. We held the demonstration on 14 October and two weeks later, work resumed, he said.
With machinery now active on the ground, expectations are high. But both authorities and residents agree on one thing: only sustained work, proper coordination, and transparent communication will ensure the long-awaited SomanyaKpong road becomes a reality.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Works-resume-on-Krobo-roads-after-months-of-youth-pressure-2010495
"GTEC, NaCCA lead dialogue to ensure universities align with new SHS reforms","The Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC), in collaboration with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA), has intensified nationwide engagements with tertiary education leaders to prepare universities and colleges for the first cohort of students graduating under Ghanas reformed Senior High School (SHS) curriculum in 2027.
The latest stakeholder workshop supported by Transforming Teaching, Education and Learning (T-TEL), was held on Monday, November 17, 2025, at the GTEC premises in Accra, drawing Pro-Vice Chancellors, Provosts, Deans, Directors and Quality Assurance Officers from several tertiary institutions.
The session follows earlier engagements in Tamale, Kumasi and Takoradi, with the final zonal meeting held in Ho on November 19, 2025.
Ensuring Tertiary Preparedness for a New Kind of Learner
In his opening remarks delivered on behalf of the Director-General, Prof. Ahmed Jinapor Abdulai, the Deputy Director-General of GTEC, Prof Augustine Ocloo, underscored the Commissions commitment to building a world-class tertiary education system anchored on professionalism, transparency, inclusiveness and integrity.
He noted that the reformed SHS curriculumdesigned to equip learners with 21st-century competencieshas far-reaching implications for admissions, curriculum design, teaching methods and assessment practices at the tertiary level.
By 2027, the first batch of learners from the new SHS curriculum will enter our institutions. It is crucial that tertiary institutions are ready to receive these students and build on the skills and competencies they bring, Prof. Ocloo said.
Education is holisticfrom kindergarten to tertiaryand reforms at the pre-tertiary level must not be disconnected from what happens in universities, where learners are ultimately prepared for the world of work.
He emphasised that modern societies require not only knowledge mastery but also creativity, innovation, communication, collaboration, ICT literacy, civic awareness and problem-solving skills.
NaCCA Outlines Vision of the New Ghanaian
Director-General of NaCCA, Prof Samuel Ofori O. Bekoe, provided an overview of the philosophy and structure of the reformed SHS curriculum, which seeks to produce a new Ghanaiana learner equipped with relevant skills and values for lifelong learning and national development.
We have begun a journey of producing the new Ghanaian, and that journey cannot end at the senior high school level, Prof Bekoe said.
We want universities to continue this transformation so that Ghana produces responsible, GESI-aware, innovative citizens ready for further studies, work and adult life.
He highlighted weaknesses in the previous curriculum, including its heavy emphasis on rote memorisation, traditional examinations and limited focus on critical thinking, STEM, socio-emotional learning and real-world problem-solving.
The revised curriculum introduces competency-based learning, inclusive pedagogies, STEM-focused pathways, new subject combinations and a transcript system that captures both academic performance and character development.
Aligning Tertiary Assessment and Pedagogy
Resource persons at the workshop guided participants through the implications of the reforms for teaching, learning and assessment at the tertiary level.
Prof Eric Anane, Director of the Institute of Education at the University of Cape Coast, explained the structure of the new SHS transcript system and its implications for admissions.
Prof Eric Daniel Ananga of the University of Education, Winneba, emphasised the need for universities to rethink pedagogy, assessment methods and student support systems if they are to effectively educate graduates from the reformed SHS system.
He noted that universities currently rely heavily on WASSCE aggregates for admissions, which overlook competencies such as creativity, collaboration, practical skills and portfolio evidence.
Prof Ananga proposed several strategies, including diversified entry requirements, greater use of competency-based transcripts, bridge programmes for smoother student transitions, active learning, problem-based approaches and technology-enhanced instruction and professional development for lecturers in 21st-century pedagogy.
Universities that align with the SHS reforms will produce graduates who are confident, competent and ready for the world of work, he said.
Toward a Coherent, Future-Ready Education System
The ongoing engagements represent a pivotal step toward building a coherent, learner-centred education system that aligns pre-tertiary and tertiary pathways. By sensitising universities early, GTEC aims to ensure a smooth transition for future SHS graduates and position Ghana to produce a skilled, adaptable workforce for the 21st century.
As Prof Ocloo stated, Our goal is to make our tertiary institutions truly 21st-century institutionscapable of training graduates who can thrive in a rapidly changing world.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/GTEC-NaCCA-lead-dialogue-to-ensure-universities-align-with-new-SHS-reforms-2010493
MCE vows to step down if investigations link him to galamsey,"Wisdom Osei Boamah, MCE for the Atwima Nwabiagya South Municipality, has strongly denied allegations that he is involved in illegal mining (galamsey), calling the claims baseless and motivated by hate and malice.
He has also challenged critics to allow a formal and independent probe into the said allegations.
Speaking on Angel FM during a programme hosted by Nana Darkwa Soldier, the MCE said he is ready to accept the outcome of any credible investigation and made a serious pledge. In his pledge, he said, If any credible investigation shows I am into galamsey, I will resign.
Boamah used the radio platform to refute the public accusations and urged relevant authorities to carry out a transparent inquiry to clear the matter. He framed his readiness to step down as evidence of confidence in his innocence and of his willingness to be held accountable if found culpable.
Background to the allegations
A group of National Democratic Congress (NDC) youth, led by Mohammed Iddrisu, who describes himself as a member of an anti-galamsey task force, held a press conference and submitted a petition to the Ashanti Regional Coordinating Council demanding the MCEs removal.
The petition accuses Boamah of facilitating large-scale destruction of a forest reserve and the pollution of the River Offin through illicit mining activities. The group also alleges that the MCE has invoked the name of NDC National Chairman Johnson Asiedu Nketia as a cover for the alleged activities.
Tension in the municipality has escalated since the allegations surfaced, with protesters calling for immediate administrative action and stricter enforcement against illegal mining. The complainants want the regional council and other regulatory bodies to investigate and, if necessary, remove the MCE from the office.
In reaction to the said claims, Osei Boamah has publicly invited a credible probe into the matter and framed resignation as the appropriate response if the investigation substantiates the claims. The matters continue to unfold as the Ashanti Regional Coordinating Council is yet to come out with any official response.", Nana Peprah,Regional, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/MCE-vows-to-step-down-if-investigations-link-him-to-galamsey-2010489
UMaT breaks ground for Mining Robotics and Engineering Materials Testing Lab,"The University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Tarkwa, has broken ground for the construction of a state-of-the-art Mining Robotics and Engineering Materials Testing Laboratory, a project funded under the Ghana Chamber of Mines Tertiary Education Fund (GCM-TEF).
The facility, described as a transformational investment for Ghanas mining future, will house advanced mining simulators, engineering materials testing equipment, and AI-driven mine automation technologies aimed at redefining mining education, research, and industry practice.
Speaking at the sod-cutting ceremony, the CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Mines, Ing. Dr Kenneth Ashigbey, described the project as a strategic milestone that aligns with the rapid technological transformation sweeping across the global mining industry.
He highlighted that the Tertiary Education Fund is fully financed by producing member companies of the Chamber and reflects their belief that the future of mining depends on strong human capital and high-performing research institutions such as UMaT.
Dr Ashigbey noted that from 2014 to 2023, Ghana generated over US$40 billion in mineral revenue, with US$29 billion returned to the country through the Bank of Ghana and commercial banks, alongside over US$220 million in CSR investments.
Dr Ashigbey stressed that the robotics and materials testing center will revolutionise local content development by enabling Ghanaian manufacturers to prototype, test, and certify industrial materials locally rather than relying on expensive foreign laboratories.
This moves Ghana from a passive buy-local policy to an active make local, innovate local, and certify local industrial strategy, he stated.
Prof. Grace Ofori Sarpong, Pro Vice-Chancellor of UMaT, expressed profound gratitude to the Chamber of Mines for the continuous support and investment in human capital development.
She noted that since its launch in 2019, the first phase of the GCM-TEFvalued at over US$2 millionhas significantly strengthened innovation and research at the university.

"Offinso North DCE denies 24-hour market claims, cites ministry criteria","The District Chief Executive (DCE) for Offinso North, Ceasar Ofosu Acheampong, has strongly rejected claims that he directed the siting of a proposed 24hour economy market in Nkenkansu because it is his hometown.
He spoke to the media in response to a recent press conference by a group of Akumadan residents who accused him of reneging on an earlier promise to locate the market in the district capital.
Acheampong described the allegations as unfounded and urged calm amid the rising tensions.
He explained that the selection of the market site followed strict, objective guidelines issued by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and communicated through the Regional Coordinating Council (RCC) in a letter dated August 12.
""The decision to site the 24hour market in Nkenkansu was not influenced by my personal interest,"" Acheampong said.
He outlined the RCCs criteria that guided the process.
According to him, it required a land size of two to four acres, proximity to a town centre with good access to public transport, and availability of proper land documentation, including site plans.
""The Assembly did not choose the site at its own discretion; we followed the precise instructions from the RCC,"" he added, stressing that not every project automatically goes to the district capital.
On the allegation that he had promised Akumadan the 24hour market, the DCE clarified that he never made such a commitment.
""The only promise I made was about relocating and expanding the existing Akumadan weekly market to a new site, not about siting the 24hour market in Akumadan,"" he said.
Acheampong also addressed accusations that his hometown connection influenced decisions: ""If I am from Nkenkansu and, based on the stipulated criteria, the market should rightly be sited in Nkenkansu, what is my crime?"" he asked, noting precedent that other projects have been sited according to criteria rather than personal ties.
The DCE emphasised the governments decentralisation agenda and the need for equitable development across the district.
""We must decentralise projects to develop the entire district, not concentrate everything in one town. Spreading facilities across towns reduces congestion and ensures wider benefits. This is the essence of decentralisation and aligns with the Presidents vision,"" he said.
Concluding his remarks, Ceasar Ofosu Acheampong appealed for unity and restraint.
""Let us work together for the progress of Offinso North. These divisions are unnecessary and hinder our collective development,"" he urged.", Nana Peprah,Regional, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Offinso-North-DCE-denies-24-hour-market-claims-cites-ministry-criteria-2010459
Nana Adjei Kyerema challenges MP on galamsey and past accountability,"The 2024 Independent Parliamentary Candidate for Atiwa East Constituency in the Eastern Region, Nana Adjei Kyerema, has responded to the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Atiwa East Constituency in the Eastern Region, Abena Osei-Asare, over her disingenuous criticism of the current government's approach to fighting illegal mining (galamsey).
Osei-Asare, who served in the New Patriotic Party administration as the former Deputy Finance Minister in charge of Revenue, made headlines during the debate of the 2025 budget in Parliament when she referred to the government's fight against the illegal menace as ""plastic chair approach to the galamsey fight.""
This analogy was used to imply the government's approach lacked serious financing and robust measures.
The outspoken politician questioned the  MP and the government at the time's track record and suggested it was hypocritical for her to criticize the current government's efforts now.
The public debate reflects ongoing political discourse in Ghana regarding the most effective strategies to combat galamsey, which has caused extensive environmental destruction in the country.
Nana Adjei Kyerema's statement, ""CALLING OUT INCONSISTENCY AND DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY,"" criticised Abena Osei-Asare for her comments on the national fight against galamsey (illegal mining), contrasting her public stance today to her role as a key member in the erstwhile government's handling of the issue.
The core of Kyerema's argument is that Osei-Asare, a former Deputy Finance Minister under the past government, lacks the moral standing to criticise the current administration's efforts against galamsey, given her previous government's perceived failures in addressing the issue.
Nana Adjei Kyerema noted that the MP for Atiwa East has recently spoken forcefully about the national fight against galamsey as captured by many national news outlets, an attempt to sway the attention of the public from her own handling of the issue she superintended over for 12 years, and particularly the 8 years she served as a key and influential member of the past government.
Nana Adjei Kyerema was of the view that the MP concerns may sound timely, but they cannot be taken at face value without examining the context in which they are being made.
According to him, when leaders comment on matters they oversaw for years, their constituents and Ghanaians at large deserve clarity, not selective recollection.
He noted that Abena Osei Asare has represented Atiwa East for more than twelve years, stressing that the eight of those years, her party controlled the national executive.
Nana Adjei Kyerema argued that during the same period, she also served as Deputy Minister of Finance for two terms and played a central role in budget preparation throughout the last administration.
He mentioned that these years coincide with the period in which most constituencies, including Atiwa East, suffered some of the worst environmental destruction in their history.
Nana Adjei Kyerema asserted that the galamsey devastation unfolded directly under her leadership as MP and during her tenure as a senior member of the team responsible for financing the national fight against galamsey.
He stressed that ""It is therefore difficult to accept her recent posture as though she did not influence the actions and inactions that brought her constituency and the country to this point.""
Nana Adjei Kyerema pointed out that ""As Deputy Minister of Finance, she had both the opportunity and the authority to push for the very national budgetary prioritisation she now demands"".
He added that as MP she also had the platform to champion decisive local interventions to protect Atiwa East, noting that, ""Yet residents witnessed a steady decline of forest cover, polluted water bodies and expanding mining pits.""
""Today, the scars are visible even from the Accra to Kumasi highway. This deterioration did not happen overnight, and it certainly did not happen without years of public concern, media coverage, and repeated appeals from communities across the constituency.""
""Towns such as Anyinam and Asaman Tamfoe in particular consistently warned of the growing destruction. Their protests were captured by national media, and their petitions were formally submitted to district authorities. Their appeals were clear and persistent, yet the deterioration continued almost unchecked,"" Nana Adjei Kyerema explained.
Against this background, her sudden criticism of current budget allocations to the frontline agencies fighting galamsey sits in sharp contrast to the missed opportunities during the period when her voice and authority carried the most weight.
Given this history, her remarks raise an important question.
How can someone who held influence in both the executive and the legislature throughout the crisis now speak as though the problem emerged only after she left the executive?
Leadership requires more than commentary.
It requires accountability.
When a constituency suffers this level of devastation during a leaders tenure, that leader cannot simply reposition themselves as an advocate for those affected without addressing their own record.
Her statements also reinforce a growing frustration among Ghanaians.
Many see a pattern in which some politicians denounce problems only after they have failed to address them while in government.
This pattern erodes public trust, undermines credibility, and strengthens the perception that political positions are too often shaped by convenience rather than conviction.
Nana Adjei Kyerema stressed that ""If the MP wishes to contribute constructively to the galamsey discourse, she must first provide a transparent account of what actions she took to protect Atiwa East during her tenure.""
He stressed that the female MP must explain what interventions she supported, what outcomes they delivered, why those outcomes failed to halt the decline, and what efforts she made within the Ministry of Finance to secure adequate resources for the institutions responsible for combating galamsey.
Nana Adjei Kyerema was of the view that without that clarity, Atiwa East MP's current criticisms appear disconnected from the reality Ghanaians witnessed.
He pointed out that they may reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence public perception rather than confront the substance of the issue.
Nana Adjei Kyerema said Atiwa East and Ghana deserve leadership that stands up when it matters, not only when it is politically convenient.
According to him, the environmental destruction of the past decade demands honesty, responsibility, and a firm commitment to ensuring that the mistakes of the past are not repeated.
Nana Adjei Kyerema reaffirmed their position to continue to insist on accountability and push for the transformational leadership that the people of Atiwa East and Ghana as a whole have long been denied.", Kay Agbenyega,Regional, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Nana-Adjei-Kyerema-challenges-MP-on-galamsey-and-past-accountability-2010455
Advocate warns of increasing sex-for-fish trade at Western Region beaches,"There are growing concerns over the increasing spate of sextortion, where sex is used as a means of payment for services by some disadvantaged women who are exploited by some men, as they take advantage of them.
Narrating some of these forms of sextortion at a days training workshop on corruption and Gender Dimensions of corruption organised by Transparency International Ghana in Takoradi, the executive director of Rural Development Network ( RUDNET- Ghana), Oliver Cromwell, revealed that along the beaches of the Western region, the issue of young girls offering themselves for fish is a common occurrence;
""Sex for fishers has been there for a while now; when you go to our beaches from Sekondi to Axim to Esiama, we have these young girls who eke out a living on their own and as such engage in all manner of acts for survival ranging from offering themselves for sex in return for fish which they sell to earn money,"" he revealed.
He revealed that other ladies who are familiar with the fisherfolk readily offer sex to get fish in return to feed their families, he continued.
""We have other young girls who also offer sex to get capital to trade and money for their hair and upkeep. There are ranges, the low class, middle class ...even beyond this, there are ghettos dotted along our beaches where girls operate brothels and offer sex for 20,30 cedis for a session. There is therefore a need for the metropolitan municipal district assemblies to step up the needed awareness for the youths on the dangers therein.
""We need to go to the ghettos, especially those for the young girls, where some homeowners have offered abodes for them to indulge in such indecency, with the landlords charging 30 cedis a day. This goads the girls on, and the assemblies must strategise at providing some vocation for these young girls,"" he passionately appealed.
Tracing the trends of sextortion, the Head of Finance of Transparency International Ghana, Benedict Doh, revealed that a recent study by the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice and the Ghana Statistical Service in 2022 revealed that a sizeable percentage of respondents of a recent survey buttressed the incidence of sex before service is rendered.
""...the survey revealed the 3.39 percent of the respondents who were women indicated that sex was demanded of them when they needed service from public officials as a form of a bribe before you can access the said service  This is quite critical since women form a greater chunk of Ghana's population. If even they( women) constitute 60 percent, and you juxtapose it against the 3.39 percent of the survey, it is an issue of huge concern, so we need to direct all energies into an advocacy in preventing women from being unduly taken advantage of,"" Benedict stressed.", Thomas Tetteh,Regional, 21 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Advocate-warns-of-increasing-sex-for-fish-trade-at-Western-Region-beaches-2010448

NDC communicator accuses NPP of 'complicity' in LGBTQ+ bill delay,"A Communication team member of the ruling National Democratic Congress, Japhet Festus Gbede, has accused the former New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration led by former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia of deliberately refusing to assent to the LGBTQ+ bill before exiting office.
Speaking on Kaleawo FMs newspaper review segment hosted by Agbemabiese Makafui, popularly known as Trump, Gbede stated that the NPPs posture on the matter amounted to what he described as a subtle endorsement of the LGBTQ+ agenda during their tenure.
According to him, the Akufo-Addo/Bawumia administration had more than enough time and authority to act on the bill but chose not to, a situation he believes betrayed the cultural and moral expectations of the Ghanaian people.
If the NPP were genuinely committed to protecting Ghanaian values, President Akufo-Addo would have signed the LGBTQ+ bill long before leaving office. Their silence and inaction were not accidental; it was a calculated decision, he asserted.
Gbede, the fire brand communications team member of the Akatsi South NDC cautioned the NPP to refrain from commenting on the current progress being made by the government of President John Dramani Mahama on the same bill, insisting that they lack the moral standing to do so.
The NPP should remain quiet as President Mahama works to complete the process they abandoned. They had every opportunity and failed. Mahama is doing what they were afraid to do, he added.
He further assured the public that President Mahama remains committed to ensuring that the bill, once returned to Parliament, is processed and assented to without any external influence.
President Mahama has always put Ghana first. He is bold, resolute, and will do everything humanly possible to ensure that the cultural identity of Ghanaians is protected. The bill will be passed into law, he emphasised.
Japhet Festus Gbedes remarks have since generated reactions from political observers, with some agreeing that the issue has become a major point of ideological contrast between the NDC and the NPP.", Koku Agbenaza,Regional, 20 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/NDC-communicator-accuses-NPP-of-complicity-in-LGBTQ-bill-delay-2010289
NDC women's organiser slams government over appointment of Amina Nassar to Hajj board,"A branch Women's Organizer of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC), Sambo Fuseina, has issued a strongly-worded statement condemning what she describes as an act of nepotism and political indulgence following the appointment of Amina Nassar to the Hajj Board.
Nassar, the wife of the Ayawaso East MP, already serves on the governing board of Sankofa Gold. Her new appointment, according to the party's women's organizer, represents an assault on fairness, integrity and meritocracy within the governing party and in public office.
In the press release going viral sighted by the media, Fuseina argues that the NDC did not return to power for public positions to become a private inheritance for a select few.
She cited the Public Office Conduct Act of 1993 and the Companies Act of 2019, stressing that the dual appointments violate legal expectations of independence, fiduciary responsibility, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.
This appointment tramples on the dignity of public office and sends the horrifying message that family proximity to political power now outweighs years of sacrifice and loyalty to the party, she wrote.
The NDC Women's Organizer expressed frustration that many hardworking party activists who contributed significantly to the partys 2024 victory have not been acknowledged or appointed, while someone already serving on a prominent board has been given an additional national role.
Although she did not mention names in her statement, she insisted that numerous dedicated grassroots members in Zongos who sacrificed their energy, time and resources for the Mahama comeback have been sidelined.
Fuseina described the development as an insult and a slap in the face to loyal party foot soldiers.
According to her, the appointment threatens internal cohesion, undermines public confidence and risks contradicting the leadership values President Mahama has pledged to uphold.
It stains the image of the government. It sends the wrong signal to the grassroots. It erodes unity and creates unnecessary anger within the rank and file, she said.
Calling for an immediate reversal, she warned that the party cannot demand accountability while promoting what she believes is selective amnesia.
This is the time to correct the error. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Now, Fuseina concluded.
The statement has triggered early discussions among party supporters on social media, with some backing her call for fairness in appointments while others argue that they don't know exactly who is advising the presidency to continue to commit such political blunders.", Japhet Festus Gbede,Regional, 20 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/NDC-women-s-organiser-slams-government-over-appointment-of-Amina-Nassar-to-Hajj-board-2010288

GJA honours GNA Eastern Regional Manager for Road Safety reporting,"Dasmani Issifu Laary, Eastern Regional Manager of the Ghana News Agency (GNA), has won the Road Safety Reporting Award at the 29th Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) Media Awards for his investigative piece, Deadly Highways: Fixing Ghanas Silent Epidemic.
The award, presented on November 8 at the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi, recognised the investigative piece that exposed systemic causes of road fatalities and proposed reforms to improve safety across national transport corridors.
According to the citation, Deadly Highways combined meticulous research, compelling storytelling, and a commitment to truth, and informed the public and inspired action from policymakers and stakeholders.
The ceremony, hosted by the Asante King, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, was attended by President John Dramani Mahama as Special Guest of Honour.
It marked the first time the GJA Awards were held in the Ashanti Regional capital, Kumasi, and outside the national capital, Accra.
In his address, President Mahama reaffirmed his governments commitment to protecting journalists, upholding press freedom, and restoring Ghanas leadership in media freedom on the continent.
Laary, who joined GNA in 2012 and currently serves as Eastern Regional Manager and senior editor, told reporters, I have never submitted a story for an award before. I wanted to highlight a national crisis.
He described being selected from over 321 entries as humbling.
He noted that the report has since been referenced by local and international platforms, advocacy campaigns, and policy briefings, which have called for stronger enforcement, improved road maintenance, and data-driven interventions.
In his keynote remarks, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II spoke on the broader responsibilities of leadership and the press.
He cautioned against complacency and the corrosive effects of bad incentives, stating, We must not go down in history as the generation that stood by.
He urged journalists and leaders to act with courage and principle and called for a national dialogue to save the mainstream print media, warning that unregulated new media could undermine democratic discourse.
The Road Safety Reporting category was one of 36 awards spanning print, broadcast, and digital media, reflecting the GJAs belief that quality journalism shapes public policy and safeguards lives.
The event drew representatives from the judiciary, government communications, UNESCO Ghana, the diplomatic corps, and hundreds of media professionals.
Laary, who is a PhD candidate in Migration Studies at the University of Ghanas Centre for Migration Studies, is currently investigating the experiences of migrants in Ghana, with a focus on the expectations and realities of motorcycle taxi drivers in the Accra Metropolitan Area.
His academic research complements his award-winning journalism, reflecting a deep commitment to uncovering systemic challenges and amplifying the voices of vulnerable populations.
He dedicated the award to victims of road crashes and highlighted his ongoing initiative, the Safe Roads Ghana Legacy, which he described as a multi-pronged effort to transform road safety culture through media, policy, and community engagement.
Laarys editorial leadership is grounded in a rich portfolio of professional development across journalism, public policy, health, and strategic communication.", Michael Oberteye,Regional, 20 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/GJA-honours-GNA-Eastern-Regional-Manager-for-Road-Safety-reporting-2010255
Review Office of Special Prosecutor to cut waste - Manhyia South MP tells government,"Member of Parliament for Manhyia South, Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah, has urged government to critically review the relevance and impact of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), arguing that the state may be wasting scarce resources on duplicative anti-corruption structures.
Speaking on the floor of Parliament on Wednesday, November 19, 2025, during the debate on the 2026 Budget, the MP questioned the justification for allocating GH158 million to the OSP.
According to him, Ghana has created too many parallel anti-corruption institutions, yet corruption remains pervasive.
Mr Speaker, its about time we take a critical look at our expenditure. Mr Speaker, we have too many institutions fighting corruption, but we must ask ourselves whether or not the Office of the Special Prosecutor is still a necessity.
He argued that merging or consolidating some of these institutions may produce better results while reducing financial waste.
Mr Speaker, we need to consolidate the institutions that fight corruption in this country by making sure we avoid duplicity and enhance investments in those already-existing institutions. That is how we can fight corruption well without losing good money, as weve seen over a period.
Baffour Awuah therefore called on the Attorney General to review the mandate, efficiency, and overall relevance of the OSP, stressing that taxpayers are not getting value for money.
Weve tried it for over seven years and the results are there for us all to see. It is good money chasing bad money, he concluded.",,Regional, 20 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Review-Office-of-Special-Prosecutor-to-cut-waste-Manhyia-South-MP-tells-government-2010236
GH13 billion presidential jet plan misplaced priority  Manhyia South MP,"Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah, Member of
Parliament
for Manhyia South, has taken a swipe at the NDC government over what he describes as a misplaced and reckless economic priority in the 2026 Budget.
Speaking on the floor of
Parliament
on Wednesday, November 19, 2025, during the budget debate, the MP expressed shock over the governments intention to commit about GH13 billion towards the procurement of a new presidential jet while over 78,000 qualified Ghanaian nurses remain unemployed.
According to him, such a decision does not only deny Ghanaian youth opportunities but rather channels revenue to foreign economies at Ghanas expense.
With this choice, you are only giving foreign countries revenue while our competent youth remain unemployed, he said.
The people from whom you obtained the GH13 billion are not getting jobs  your own taxpayers  and this is the choice you make at this point of austerity? Mr Speaker, it is certainly not a prudent choice, Awuah stressed.
The Manhyia South MP further warned that the economic path the government has chosen could force Ghana back into the arms of the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Speaker, I dont want to be a prophet of doom, but this NDC government led by
John Dramani Mahama
will go back to the IMF because this is a very imprudent economic choice, he declared.
Citing international development examples, the MP argued that countries that have risen to economic strength did not do so through extravagant expenditure on aircraft at the expense of job creation.
Mr Speaker, Malaysia did not develop by making such expenditure choices. They didnt become an Asian tiger by procuring aircraft when their teeming youth didnt have jobs. Singapore did not develop by procuring aircraft when its young people were struggling to secure employment, he added.
He urged the government to prioritise job creation, particularly for health professionals and other skilled youth, instead of luxury acquisitions that do not directly benefit the Ghanaian people.",,Regional, 20 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/GH-13-billion-presidential-jet-plan-misplaced-priority-Manhyia-South-MP-2010235

Bogoso-Prestea Mine Disaster: Prophet Alla-Mensah calls for vigilance and prayer,"Founder of the House of Divine Glory Church, Prophet Jimmy Alla-Mensah, has expressed deep sorrow over Tuesdays fatal underground explosion at the Bogoso-Prestea Mine, describing the tragedy as a painful reminder of the need for vigilance and early intervention when warnings are issued.
At least six illegal miners are feared dead after noxious fumesbelieved to have been triggered by an unauthorised underground blastfilled sections of the abandoned shafts at Levels 8 and 9 of the mine. Some unconfirmed reports suggest the death toll could be higher, with initial figures ranging between 11 and 30.
Reacting to the incident in a Facebook post on Wednesday, Prophet Alla-Mensah said the disaster confirms the urgency of prophetic warnings, referencing a caution he shared on November 8.
According to him, ten days prior to the explosion, he had released a prophecy describing a fiery dart heading toward Bogoso, transforming into a gas tanker that exploded into a ball of firesymbolising, he said, the threat of a fire-related disaster in the area.
No one takes glory in tragedy, he wrote. The purpose of prophecy is intervention, not validation. We continue to stand in the gap for the Western Region and for every family affected by this painful incident.
The U.S.-based Ghanaian prophet called for intensified prayer, vigilance, and safety measures in mining communities to prevent further loss of life.
May the God of mercy preserve the survivors, comfort the grieving, and bring divine covering over all mining communities across Ghana. Let the bloodshed stop, he added.
Authorities are yet to issue an official statement on the exact number of casualties, citing the clandestine nature of the miners entry into the abandoned pit. Mine sources, however, point to asphyxiationlikely from carbon gasesas the cause of death, following what they believe was an unsanctioned blast initiated by the illegal miners themselves.

Suspected cyanide contamination hits Amansie West,"The Amansie West District Assembly in the Ashanti Region has convened an emergency meeting of key stakeholders to develop a decisive strategy for tackling a suspected outbreak of cyanide contamination in several local water bodies.
The highly toxic substance is allegedly being smuggled into the district by foreign nationals, reportedly from Burkina Faso, for use in illegal mining activities.
Stakeholder assessment plan
The urgent meeting brought together critical entities, including the District Security Council (DISEC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), major mining companies like Asanko Gold Mines, and the Ghana National Small Scale Miners Association.
The primary outcome was the formulation of a comprehensive plan to immediately assess the situation across all potentially affected communities.
Communities currently suspected of being impacted by the cyanide contamination include Mpatuam, Manso, and Keniago, among others.
Details of the Assemblys response
Speaking to the media following the high-stakes deliberation, Thomas Okrah Kwame, the District Coordinating Director and representative for the District Chief Executive (DCE), affirmed the Assembly's commitment to treating the issue with the utmost seriousness.
Field visits and assessment
A joint team comprising officials from the EPA, the National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO), and DISEC will immediately conduct field visits to the named communities to assess the scale and impact of the suspected contamination.
Wider water quality testing
Following the initial assessment in the priority areas, the Coordinating Director stated that the testing would be expanded to other communities within the district to ascertain the quality and safety of their drinking water sources.
EPA's warning
During the meeting, officials from the EPA underscored the extreme danger posed by the substance.
They explained that cyanide is a highly potent poison and warned that if it comes into contact with or seeps into water bodies, it has the potential to cause the instantaneous death of both humans and animals.
Industrial safety protocols
A representative from Asanko Gold Mines addressed the stakeholders, providing an educational overview of the stringent safety measures they employ in their industrial use of cyanide.
The representative detailed that after use in their operations, the cyanide residue is carefully contained and stored in a designated dam, which is subsequently emptied into safe, controlled locations in accordance with environmental protocols.
Traditional leadership
Serving as the Chairman for the stakeholders' meeting, Nana Asare Frimpong, the Akyeamhene (Sub-Chief) of the Manso Nkwanta Paramount Chief, voiced his deep alarm over the developing situation and stressed the need for swift, decisive action.
Background on smuggling and arrests
This emergency response follows events that occurred approximately two weeks prior, when the Ghana Police Service, supported by Immigration officers in the Amansie West District, arrested about 22 nationals from Burkina Faso.
These individuals were apprehended on suspicion of smuggling substances believed to be cyanide into the communities, stored in drums and various other receptacles.

GMA condemns youth attack on Northern Regional Hospital,"The Ghana Medical Association (GMA) has condemned an alleged youth attack on the Northern Regional Hospitalformerly the Tamale Central Hospitallocking up administrative offices and barricading the Out-Patients Department in what the association describes as a reckless and dangerous act.
In a statement on Wednesday, November 19, the association said it had taken note of a viral video circulating on social media showing the group besieging the hospital premises, including the office of the Medical Director and other key administrative spaces.
The GMA warned that such actions jeopardise the lives of both patients and health workers and also threaten the security of hospital property.
According to the association, the growing trend of youth groups invading health facilities to address grievances outside of the laid-down public service procedures poses a significant risk to health service delivery.
It stressed that these confrontational tactics undermine order and safety, noting that there are clear mechanisms for resolving disputes within the health sector.
The GMA has therefore called on the Ghana Police Service to immediately apprehend those involved in the incident. It also urged traditional leaders to intervene and help restore calm while ensuring that any legitimate concerns are addressed through the appropriate channels.
The association further requested that the Ghana Health Service (GHS) provide immediate protection for the Medical Director and all staff at the facility while ongoing issues are resolved.

Civil society advocate expresses worry over growing sex-for-fish menace,"There are growing concerns over the increasing spate of sextortion, where sex is used as a means of payment for services by some disadvantaged women who are exploited by men taking advantage of them.
Narrating some of these forms of sextortion at a one-day training workshop on corruption and the gender dimensions of corruption, organised by Transparency International Ghana in Takoradi, the Executive Director of Rural Development Network (RUDNET-Ghana), Oliver Cromwell, revealed that along the beaches of the Western Region, the issue of young girls offering themselves for fish is a common occurrence.
Sex-for-fish has been there for a while now. When you go to our beaches from Sekondi to Axim to Esiama, we have these young girls who eke out a living on their own and, as such, engage in all manner of acts for survivalranging from offering themselves for sex in return for fish, which they sell to earn money, he revealed.
He added that other women familiar with fisherfolk readily offer sex to get fish in return to feed their families.
We have other young girls who also offer sex to get capital to trade and money for their hair and upkeep. There are rangesthe low class, middle class... even beyond this, there are ghettos dotted along our beaches where girls operate brothels and offer sex for 20 or 30 cedis per session. There is therefore a need for the metropolitan, municipal, and district assemblies to step up awareness for the youth on the dangers therein.
""We need to go to the ghettos, especially those for young girls, where some homeowners have offered abodes for them to indulge in such indecency, with landlords charging 30 cedis a day. This goads the girls on, and the assemblies must strategise to provide some vocation for these young girls, he passionately appealed.
Tracing the trends of sextortion, the Head of Finance of Transparency International Ghana, Benedict Doh, revealed that a recent study by the Commission for Human Rights and Administrative Justice and the Ghana Statistical Service in 2022 showed that a sizeable percentage of respondents confirmed the incidence of sex before service is rendered.
...The survey revealed that 3.39 percent of the respondents, who were women, indicated that sex was demanded of them when they needed service from public officials, as a form of bribe before they could access the said service. This is quite critical since women form a greater chunk of Ghanas population.
""If even they (women) constitute 60 percent, and you juxtapose it against the 3.39 percent from the survey, it is an issue of huge concern. We need to direct all energies into advocacy to prevent women from being unduly taken advantage of, stressed Benedict Doh.", Thomas Tetteh,Regional, 19 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Civil-society-advocate-expresses-worry-over-growing-sex-for-fish-menace-2010145
Kwahu Traditional Council condemns palace invasion,"The Kwahu Traditional Council (KTC) has addressed the public regarding recent developments, as it condemned the armed invasion of the Abene Palace and reaffirmed its full support for Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng III as the only legitimately enstooled Kwahumanhene.
The sub-chiefs in a press conference held directly in response to an incident on Monday, November 17, 2025, during which the deposed chief, Eugene Asante Boadi, formerly Daasebre Akuamoah Agyapong II, allegedly led a group of armed men in uniform to seize the palace, described the incident as regrettable and disgraceful.
Kwahuhemaa released after dawn abduction, police launch investigation
Kwahu Adontenghene and Chief of Abetifi, Akyemfour Asiedu Agyemang III, unequivocally affirmed the destoolment of the former Kwahumanhene, and reaffirmed that Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng III is the only legitimate Kwahumanhene.
It was initially alleged that the raid led by the deposed Eugene Asante Boadi was an act to enforce a court order.
However, the council firmly rejected the claims that the raid on Abene Palace with armed men in uniform to forcibly seize the palace was to enforce a court order.
The Kwahu Adontenghene said, It was an unlawful operation and our lawyers are handling the matter.
The KTC alleged that Eugene Asante Boadi led the raid, which involved the mishandling of the Kwahuhemaa, Nana Adwoa Gyamfua III.
It was also reported that Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng III and six others were arrested and transported to Police Headquarters, but were subsequently released without any charges being filed.
The Council wishes to emphasise that no charges were brought against Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng III or the Nanahemaa, and they were subsequently released, Adontenghene reiterated.
The Councils legal representatives are actively handling the matter, and a petition has been filed with the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to investigate the raid and the alleged assault on the Nanahemaa and other persons in the palace.
The Council detailed a series of events leading to the current crisis, stating that Eugene Asante Boadi was formally enstooled in 2017 and later appointed Board Chairman of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) in 2021.
However, in September 2024, a formal petition was filed with the former President of Ghana, Nana Addo, by businessman Collins Darkwah Aboagye, alleging that Asante Boadi had extorted GH2 million from him, in addition to a GH50,000 facilitation fee, under the guise of helping to secure a loan from ADB for his company.
Following a presidential directive and its own investigation, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) concluded that Asante Boadis conduct had irreparably tarnished the bank's image. The Central Bank invoked the Banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking Institutions Act, directing his immediate resignation, which he complied with on October 11, 2024.
Akyemfour Asiedu Agyemang III stressed that concurrently, the KTC initiated its own fact-finding inquiry, which led to his deposition.
After initially denying the allegations, Eugene Asante Boadi ultimately admitted to the claims, prostrated before the chiefs, and pleaded for forgiveness. Due to the severity of his actions, which were deemed to have brought shame and disgrace to Kwahu tradition, he was customarily destooled on October 19, 2024, he said.
Following this, the Kingmakers of Kwahu enstooled Baffour Akoto Osei, a Chartered Civil Engineer from the Etena clan of Abene, as the new Kwahumanhene with the stool name Daasebre Akuamoah Boateng III, on January 25, 2025.
He was formally outdoored on March 8, 2025, in a ceremony graced by prominent chiefs and dignitaries, confirming his status as the only recognised Kwahumanhene.
The Council also addressed ongoing legal matters, noting that a case filed by Eugene Asante Boadi at the Koforidua High Court was quashed by a unanimous Supreme Court decision on July 8, 2025.
Kwahu Twafohene, Nana Kwasi Opoku Mintah II, emphasised that while Asante Boadi has secured an injunction from the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs (ERHC) against the new chief, an appeal against this injunction has been filed, which, by the rules of the ERHC, operates as a stay, meaning the order cannot be enforced pending the appeal's outcome.
Kwahumanhene calls for natives' support to return Okwahu United to GPL
Kwahuhemaa, Nana Adwoa Gyamfua III, in her remarks at the press conference, urged natives of Kwahu, both residential and those outside the local area, to rise and demand justice and order in the paramountcy dispute for posterity's sake.
She recounted her traumatised ordeal and called for justice as well as improved security in the community to prevent similar occurrences in the future.",,Regional, 19 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Kwahu-Traditional-Council-condemns-palace-invasion-2010144
Former transport minister demands retraction and apology from Ken City Media,"Former Minister of Transport, Kwaku Ofori Asiamah, has demanded a full public apology and retraction from Ken City Media Limited, operators of Net2 TV, over what he describes as false, defamatory, and damaging statements made about him on the network.
In a letter dated November  17,2025 and issued through his lawyers, SAO Associates, the former minister protested comments made on the stations Se No Pein! programme aired on 10 November 2025.
The statements were made by presenters Anthony Kofi Nkum Dadzie and Albert Nana Kwame Asomani.
Allegations called baseless and damaging
During the programme, the presenters alleged that Asiamah had misappropriated campaign funds, logistics, and other resources allocated for the New Patriotic Partys (NPP) 2024 presidential and parliamentary campaigns in the Central Region.
Immediate-past Transport Minister Kwaku Ofori Asiamah allegedly threatened by armed assailants
They further suggested that his supposed conduct contributed to the partys electoral losses in the region, with one presenter claiming that the former minister lacks credibility and should be ignored by NPP delegates.
Asiamah has categorically denied all allegations, describing them as reckless, untrue, and deliberately injurious to his character. His lawyers argue that the broadcast has already caused significant reputational harm, both personally and professionally.
Demands to Ken City Media
In the formal notice, the former minister is insisting that Ken City Media:
1. Retract the alleged defamatory statements from all platforms, including television, YouTube, and Facebook.
2. Issue a formal written apology, carrying the same prominence and visibility as the original broadcast.
3. Cease and desist from publishing or circulating any further defamatory remarks.
Ken City Media has been given seven days to comply, failing which Asiamah has indicated he will pursue legal action.

Galamsey: Aowin chiefs deny armed gang's claim of traditional support,"In a dramatic twist to the ongoing fight against illegal mining, gazetted chiefs in the Aowin Traditional Area have issued a strong statement disassociating themselves from an armed group arrested by the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS), after the suspects claimed they were acting under traditional authority in their extortion of illegal miners.
The National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) Taskforce recently apprehended the group during a targeted operation in the Nyankamam-Armori forest of the Aowin Municipality, Western North Region.
The suspects were found in possession of weapons and talismans, raising serious concerns about organized criminality and the assertion of traditional authority as a cover for illegal conduct.
The 10 armed thugs who claim to have links with the Aowin Paramount Chief are said to operate with impunity and extort monies from Galamseyers, thereby emboldening illegal mining activities in the Aowin municipality.
This latest development prompted a public response from the gazetted chiefs within the traditional area, who called a press conference in Enchi to address the matter.
In a strongly-worded press statement, signed by key members of the Aowin Traditional Council, the legitimate, gazetted chiefs distanced themselves from the individuals and any alleged illegal activity linked to traditional leadership.
We, the undersigned gazetted chiefs within the Aowin Traditional Area, wish to categorically state that we are not in any way associated with the recent actions or decisions of individuals claiming traditional mandate or operating under a disputed position, the chiefs stated.
In their statement, the gazetted chiefs also called on relevant government agencies, including the Ministry of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Ghana Police Service, and the National House of Chiefs, to act swiftly to clarify matters and discourage further impersonation of traditional authority.
We therefore call on the authorities to treat any representation, decision, or public action by individuals claiming traditional mandate without legal backing as unauthorized and illegitimate, the chiefs emphasised.",,Regional, 18 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Galamsey-Aowin-chiefs-deny-armed-gang-s-claim-of-traditional-support-2009966
"Margins, KoKMA gives Kinbu Triangle a facelift","Margins ID Group has partnered with the Korle Klottey Municipal Assembly (KoKMA) to redevelop the Kinbu Triangle, one of central Accras busiest intersections, as part of the companys 35th anniversary celebration.
The project, fully financed by Margins as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility commitments, will introduce new greenery, safer pedestrian routes and renewable-energy lighting to ease congestion and reduce rising urban temperatures.
The handover of the site was formalised on 17 November 2025, when the Municipal Chief Executive of KoKMA, Alfred Allotey-Gaisie, officially transferred responsibility for the redevelopment to Margins.
The MCE said the professionalism and strong presentation delivered by the youthful Margins team played a significant role in the Assemblys decision to partner with the company.
He explained that several open and green spaces across the municipality require rehabilitation, noting that neglected areas quickly attract hawkers, create disorder and become difficult to reclaim. He described the initiative as a timely intervention that supports efforts to restore Accras image as a modern and well-organised capital city.
We are happy to have you as partners and look forward to working with you, he said.
Founder and CEO of Margins, Moses Kwesi Baiden Jnr, said the project reflects the creativity and leadership needed to address local urban challenges.
We are all part of government, and citizens must also play a role in finding solutions, he noted. These solutions are not always financial; sometimes they require vision and partnerships with those who share a mutual interest in national development.
Baiden commended the Assembly for recognising the problem and engaging suitable partners to deliver a sustainable solution. He said such collaboration is essential to addressing Ghanas broader development challenges by combining the resilience of the private sector with public-sector leadership.
He highlighted Margins experience in public-private partnerships, citing the Ghana Card project as a strong example of the benefits of aligning public mandates with private expertise.
Weve walked past this area many times, wondering why it had become occupied and neglected, he said. Your vision, coupled with our partnership, can transform this barren space into a landmark. All it takes is leadership and clarity of purpose.
Baiden reaffirmed Margins commitment to lighting up the triangle and ensuring the redevelopment becomes a model for similar initiatives nationwide.
This partnership reflects our belief that responsible companies must contribute to the communities they operate in. Ghana has the talent and capacity; we simply need to work together, he stated.
The redevelopment forms part of Margins ID Groups wider Sustainable Development Goals programme, particularly SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). The upgraded Kinbu Triangle is intended both as a public benefit and as a symbolic milestone marking the Groups 35 years of service.
Margins ID Systems Applications Limited, the Groups technology arm, will lead implementation and provide annual maintenance to keep the space functional and well-preserved.
Architect for the project, Ama Ogbugo of Slate Urban Design, said the aim is to create a sustainable, visually appealing and iconic destination that meets SDG standards. The design team aims to complete the redevelopment by Christmas and will work closely with Parks and Gardens and KoKMA to address any challenges that arise.
The project addresses concerns about heat, air quality, and pedestrian safety along a commercial corridor linking major roads and office complexes. The redesign will introduce climate-resilient landscaping, defined walkways and improved crossings to create a cooler, safer and more accessible environment.
The redesigned Kinbu Triangle will feature solar lighting powered by 300-watt panels, defined walkways, decorative kerbs, protective fencing, ornamental plants and a central sculptural installation.", Annette Oduro,Regional, 18 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Margins-KoKMA-gives-Kinbu-Triangle-a-facelift-2009965
Okaikwei North Assembly clears blocked access road at Abeka Free Pipe,"Residents of Abeka Free Pipe near Apenkwa in the Greater Accra Region are finally experiencing relief after the Okaikwei North Municipal Assembly removed two large metallic containers that had obstructed the communitys only motorable access route for years.
The decisive enforcement action, carried out by the Assemblys task force on Friday, restored free movement into the area and ended a long-standing struggle that had left residents frustrated and, at times, strandedespecially during heavy rains.
The containers, belonging to BIC MAC Block Works, had been positioned in a manner that not only blocked the road but also worsened flooding from a nearby storm drain.
Despite multiple official warnings and notices from the Assembly, the company reportedly failed to remove the structures.
Sources indicate that the Assembly proceeded with the removal after the company failed to produce any documentation proving ownership of the land on which the containers sat.
Earlier efforts to compel compliancesuch as removing the container doorsdid not yield results.
The task force subsequently lifted and transported the containers to the Assemblys premises at Achimota.
Grateful residents praised the Municipal Chief Executive and the Assembly officials for finally addressing their concerns.

Road safety is a moral and national imperative. Every life saved is a legacy preserved, Laary stated after receiving the award.
As Ghana intensifies efforts to reduce traffic fatalities and modernize its transport systems, Laarys recognition reaffirms the power of journalism to shape public behaviour and institutional accountability.
His work aligns with the Safe Roads Ghana Legacy Initiative (SRGLI), which he champions to transform road safety culture through media, policy, and spiritual advocacy.
He pledged to continue investigative work and advocacy, emphasizing that impactful reporting must be matched by sustained policy follow-through to reduce road deaths.

Political approach to corruption has failed Ghana  Akyem Muoso Chief,"Correspondence from Eastern Region
Osabarima Dr Owusu Beyeeman, the Chief of Akyem Muoso, has delivered a searing indictment of Ghanas political establishment, stating unequivocally that the approach used by successive regimes to combat corruption has been a complete failure and cannot resolve the national canker.
Speaking at the inaugural Yensom festival of the chiefs and people of Akyem Muoso, Osabarima Beyeeman stressed that from Ghanas independence under Dr Kwame Nkrumah, through military juntas, and into the current Fourth Republic, politicians have continuously been playing with the conscience of Ghanaians regarding the fight against graft.
The Chief lamented the pervasive nature of corruption, noting that many traditional leaders avoid commenting on the issue due to the potential backlash from the political class. However, he insisted that decisive action is paramount for the nation's progress.
Corruption has become a difficult subject matter in Ghana... It is however imperative to deal with it decisively if we want to progress as a country, Osabarima noted.
He highlighted the persistent and predictable cycle of corruption exposes linked to regime change, describing the phenomenon as a long-standing national drama.
The era when a certain group of people are powerful and angels when they are in government and in a matter of days becomes thieves when they leave power must stop. This change of regime and its associated drama of plethora of corruption related expose has become the norm, predating the inception of the fourth Republic, he stated.
Call for Ruthless Anti-Corruption Action
Osabarima Dr Owusu Beyeeman argued that the solution lies not in political rhetoric, but in empowering independent state institutions. He called for the states anti-corruption agencies and investigative bodies to work effectively and fearlessly, regardless of the status or political affiliation of the individuals involved.
He emphasised that if a government official commits an offence while in office, the state institutions responsible for investigating and prosecuting corruption-related matters must be seen to be taking immediate action.
Radical Action Needed to End Galamsey
The Chief also turned his attention to the escalating crisis of illegal mining, locally known as galamsey, warning that if the menace is not tackled fearlessly and immediately, Ghana risks an existential environmental catastrophe.
If the menace of illegal mining is not tackled fearlessly, Ghana may import water and food before we can survive as a country, he cautioned.
Osabarima Beyeeman referenced recent alarming reports detailing the power wielded by illegal miners, citing an incident where the CEO of the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), accompanied by heavy military and national security operatives, had to flee for their lives during an official tour of galamsey towns in the Ashanti Region.
He called for immediate, forceful government intervention: I believe the solution lies with the Government with all the powers of the state. A more radical and ruthless action is required to end this menace.
The Chief warned that the gangsterism by illegal [miners], if not stopped, could eventually turn into vigilantism that severely hurts the nation. He also challenged the common justification for illegal mining, vehemently disagreeing with the assertion that it provides necessary jobs for the youth.
Instead, the Muosohene demanded that financiers of galamsey must redirect their capital saying, ""Financiers of galamsey must invest in equipment that would support and improve farming rather than illegal mining that harms the environment.
Yensom Festival Launches Development Road Map
The Osabarimas address served as the highlight of the maiden Yensom festival, an initiative designed as a homecoming event aimed at promoting peaceful coexistence and strategic development within Akyem Muoso. The annual gathering is intended to bring citizens home, both local and abroad, to strategize development, conduct introspection, and plan for the ensuing year.
During the festival, a ten-year development plan was formally launched. This roadmap seeks to identify the immediate needs of Muoso and provide a structural approach for development through local initiatives and self-help projects.
Furthermore, the Muoso History Book was launched. Osabarima Dr Owusu Beyeeman explained that the book was written by the State Book after extensive research to close a historical vacuum that had allowed for the distortion, misinformation, and deliberate adulteration of history for individual interests.
The book aims to provide accurate information, widen knowledge, and accurately position Akyem Muoso within the Akyem Abuakwa State. It is intended to serve as a primary resource for investors, academicians, researchers, and, crucially, the judicial committees of the traditional council and the House of Chiefs.",,Regional, 17 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Political-approach-to-corruption-has-failed-Ghana-Akyem-Muoso-Chief-2009836

The call was made on Saturday, November 15, 2025, during the schools 65th Speech and Prize-Giving Day, where Dr Parker I, the Chief of Sokode-Juaso and an old student, served as Guest of Honor.
Addressing the gathering, Dr Barimah Kwabena Awuah Parker I, emphasised the critical need for parents, teachers, alumni, and the government to collaborate effectively to tackle the school's expanding infrastructure deficit.
He underscored the importance of discipline and character formation, describing them as essential pillars for nurturing responsible citizens and future leaders.
Weighing in on the national discourse surrounding student hairstyle regulations, the chief affirmed that the issue is primarily about respect for rules and order, rather than mere appearance.
Demonstrating his commitment, Dr Barimah Kwabena Awuah Parker I, generously donated GH50,000 to bolster the school's fundraising initiatives.
Adding his voice to the appeal, Nana Kwame Ampaw Addo Frempong, the Member of Parliament for the Abuakwa North constituency, reaffirmed that discipline and strong values are foundational to producing responsible future leaders.
He highlighted significant investments made in OPASS by the previous NPP government, which saw the initiation of several infrastructure projects aimed at expanding facilities and enhancing academic performance.
Frempong urged the current NDC government to prioritise the continuation and completion of these projects, support abandoned works, and back new developments to adequately meet the school's increasing student intake and evolving needs.
The MP also contributed GH10,000 to the school's development agenda, pledging his continued advocacy in Parliament for improved student welfare, infrastructure, and the overall academic environment.
Speaking on the sidelines of the ceremony, Ernest Antwi Gyimah, the Headmaster of OPASS, expressed profound concern over the escalating congestion within the school due to inadequate facilities.
He detailed shortages of essential items such as bunk beds and desks, further compounded by the presence of abandoned dormitory blocks and staff bungalows. These issues, he noted, have significantly worsened accommodation and classroom pressure as student intake continues to rise.
In a proactive move to enhance campus safety and monitoring, Ernest Antwi Gyimah announced the installation of CCTV cameras as part of ""Phase 1"" of a security improvement project, aiming to strengthen surveillance and ensure a safer learning environment for all.
Ernest Antwi Gyimah also took the opportunity to commend the 1999 year group of alumni for their consistent support in addressing urgent school needs. He revealed that despite numerous letters submitted to relevant authorities requesting assistance, the 1999 alumni group has repeatedly stepped in to provide crucial aid to the school during critical moments.

"Citizens must end 'whom you know' culture, lead anti-corruption charge  TI Ghana manager","Fundraising Manager at Transparency International (TI) Ghana, Michael Boadi, has emphasised that the battle against corruption must fundamentally begin with individual choices and a widespread mobilisation of the populace, moving beyond the perception that it is solely the government's responsibility.
Speaking in an interview during a training workshop for journalists and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) on Anti-Corruption and the Gender Dimensions of Corruption at Adako Jachie in the Ashanti region, Boadi laid out a clear roadmap for citizen engagement.
The workshop, organised by Transparency International Ghana with funding support from the European Union (EU) and GIZ, aimed at building the capacity of participants in addressing corruption, particularly its disproportionate effects on women and vulnerable groups, a concern he had previously highlighted.
Boadi challenged every individual to become an active participant in the anti-corruption drive.
""You should be the one who should start fighting corruption,"" he asserted.
He outlined specific behaviors that citizens must adopt: ""Decide that you will never offer bribes. Decide that you will never take bribes. Decide that you will not pay a facilitation fee. Decide that you will wait for your turn when you are going to obtain service. The whom you know must stop with us.""
He argued that once these personal commitments are made, it paves the way for greater accountability.
""If we do all this, then we can now begin to point accusing fingers at those who are not doing it,"" he said.
Furthermore, he urged citizens to commit to reporting corruption, whether as victims or witnesses, and to follow up and get a resolution.
In Boadi's view, a crucial missing element in Ghana's anti-corruption efforts has been the failure to rally the public.
""We haven't rallied the masses behind the fight,"" he stated.
He passionately called for a paradigm shift, saying, ""It's about time that you and I support them by giving volunteering information, by providing evidence, and also by changing our own behaviour.""
Boadi underscored that corruption, while a crime, is also a behavioral thing.
He concluded with a direct appeal to all persons, urging them to change their behavior and stop offering corruption, adding that those who receive it will likely stop receiving it.

"Divisional Chiefs of Yilo Krobo withdraw recognition of Paramount Chief, boycott festival","b>
Correspondence from Eastern Region
The Divisional and Sub-Divisional Chiefs (Asafoatseme) of the Yilo Krobo Traditional Area in the Eastern Region have announced that they no longer recognize Oklepeme Nuer Annorbaa Sasraku II as Paramount Chief (Konor) of Yilo Krobo.
The chiefs have also declared a total boycott of the 2025 Kloyosikplemi Festival, accusing the Paramount Chief of abandoning long-held cultural, customary, and traditional values.
The announcement was made on Friday, November 14, 2025, during a press conference addressed by the Divisional Chief of Okper, Nene Anyeenorgu Teye Agor IX, who stated that the decision is final and irreversible.
According to him, the Paramount Chiefs continuous neglect of traditional responsibilities has undermined the spiritual and cultural foundations of Yilo Krobo.
In a strongly worded statement, the chiefs outlined several grievances which they say amount to taboo, neglect, and desecration of sacred institutions.
Neglect of traditional duties
The chiefs accused Oklepeme Sasraku II of abolishing traditional rites such as the pouring of libation, the use of schnapps and water, and the customary sacrifice of sheep during important ceremonies.
They further alleged that for the past 10 years, the Paramount Chief has failed to celebrate the Yilo Stool (Okotoblidja)  the sacred ancestral stool described as the backbone of the unity and identity of Yilo Krobo.
They cited a 2017 ruling of the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs, which required the Paramount Chief to remain in the palace to perform mandatory customary duties. According to them, his failure to comply amounts to contempt of court and a forfeiture of his legitimacy.
Claims of sacrilege
The chiefs also described as taboo the Paramount Chiefs pronouncements during the 2023 Kings Praise crusade, where he allegedly declared that any chief who performed stool rites would lose their firstborn child.
They argue that this constitutes a serious spiritual offence, comparable to a previous case in which an Asafoatse was destooled for similar misconduct.
Even more alarming, the chiefs claim the Konor destroyed the sacred Kuntu, an ancestral altar containing six gold bars and mineral deposits contributed by the six divisions of Yilo.
They allege the site was replaced with stones and anointing oil, severing the traditional connection between the people and their ancestors.
They say they will invite the Ghana Police Service to investigate the possible loss of ancestral gold.
Violation of installation rites
According to the chiefs, the Paramount Chief now installs linguists and queenmothers using pastors and anointing oil, contrary to the established customs. They say the sacred linguist staff is now being handled by pastors, weakening the spiritual authority of the palace.
The chiefs also accuse the Konor of transforming the Kloyosikplemi Festival into a Christian crusade, sidelining a seven-member planning committee earlier constituted by representatives of all six divisions.
Ultimatum and next steps
The chiefs have given the Paramount Chiefs family until 31st December 2025 to rectify the situation. Should they fail, the chiefs say they will appoint an Acting President for the Traditional Council, pursue criminal charges regarding the destruction of the Kuntu, and cite the Paramount Chief for contempt.
Emphasizing that none of the Divisional Chiefs will attend this years festival, Nene Agor insisted that the event has lost all cultural relevance,"" adding that the chiefs no longer recognize Oklepeme Anorbaa Sasraku as Paramount Chief.
Henceforth, we no longer recognize him as Konor; we only know him privately as Tetteh Kofi Romeo, they declared. ""The time has come for Yilo Krobo to rise again.'

"Two reportedly dead, one critical in fatal gang clash in Ahafo Ano South West","Two individuals have been reported dead and one critically injured following a violent confrontation between rival gangs in Mpaasaaso Number 2, located within the Ahafo Ano South West District of the Ashanti Region.
The tragic incident occurred at approximately 3:00 a.m. on Friday, November 14, 2025.
Available information indicates that the clash involved two rival factions from Mpaasaaso Number 1 and Mpaasaaso Number 2.
In an interview on Nyankonton Mu Nsem on Rainbow Radio 87.5FM, Kwadwo Asare, a youth leader in Mpaasaaso Number 2, provided insight into the background of the conflict.
Asare revealed that one of the deceased individuals, locally identified as Commander One, had allegedly been involved in training young people in violent attacks, the use of firearms, and engaging in illicit activities, including money rituals and armed robbery.
Commander One was among those killed in the confrontation. Mr. Asare stated that the gang rivalry escalated after some of the young men trained by the deceased defected to a rival group. He further noted that Commander One was attacked and sustained a fatal stab wound to the jaw.
That young man was a hardened criminal. He had been training young boys in how to fire guns, engage in violence, perform black magic, and commit armed robbery. He had more than 32 people armed with pump-action guns. The local police had taken steps to address their activities.
""It is believed that his own trained recruits may have been responsible for his death. He terrorised the community, and while everyone was aware of his criminal activities, no one could effectively challenge him. This rivalry has persisted for two years, he said.

Plastics and other waste materials like textiles and nets threaten marine life and we must work together to repurpose waste and explore alternatives to plastics, ""he said.
According to the organizers, volunteers collected approximately 4,246.8 kilograms of waste, with plastics accounting for 470.8 kilograms, closely followed by textiles underscoring the urgent need for national strategies to manage coastal waste effectively.
To deepen participants understanding of marine conservation, WHRO Ghana organized an educational visit to the MPS Sea Turtle Hatchery, where the Executive Director of WHRO, Dr Andrews Agyekumhene, explained the monitoring of nesting sites and the hatching process.
Executive Director of Wildlife and Human Resources Organisation (WHRO Ghana), Dr Andrews Agyekumhene reiterated that protecting Ghanas coasts requires stronger waste management policies, corporate accountability, and sustained community involvement.
He further indicated that the Prampram Coastal Clean-Up forms part of WHRO Ghanas broader mission to promote resilient coastal ecosystems and protect endangered sea turtles along Ghanas shores.
The initiative, he explained, combines education, community empowerment, and partnerships with local and international stakeholders to drive sustainable environmental change.

"Ghanas TVET enrollment surges by 193%, ushering in a new era for vocational education","Enrollment at Ghanas Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions has grown by around 193% since 2020, signaling the countrys continued emphasis on skill education.
Building on this momentum, the Planet One is collaborating with the Ministry of Education to develop state-of-the-art TVET centres across the country. This is the second phase of an ambitious initiative aimed at further transforming Ghanas vocational education landscape and strengthening the broader ecosystem.
The transformation underway in Ghanas TVET sector is enabling the country to tap into the vast potential of its people and laying the groundwork for a more inclusive and prosperous future.
The remarkable surge in enrollment reflects the aspirations of Ghanas next generation and underscores the power of a holistic approach to education, said Sanjeev Mansotra, Chairman of Planet One Group.
The continued development of Ghanas vocational education system is essential for the nations progress. According to the World Banks 9th Economic Update, Ghanas working-age population is expected to grow significantly over the next decade.
This demographic shift presents a major opportunity for economic expansion, provided the growing labour force can transition into productive employment.
The report highlights the importance of structural reforms, private sector-led growth, and job creation, emphasising that investment in human capital and the digital economy will be key to Ghanas resilience and long-term prosperity.
The first phase of TVET transformation began in 2019, when Planet One partnered with the government to overhaul vocational education.
This initiative modernised 38 National Vocational Training Institutions, established two new foundry and machining centres and upgraded the Opportunities Industrialisation Centre in Accra.
Enhanced infrastructure, including hostels, classrooms, ICT labs, workshops, and industrial-grade equipment, has expanded capacity and made TVET accessible to students from both urban and rural communities.
Nearly 700 teachers and trainers have received up-to-date training, while new curricula have been introduced to align with Ghanas industrial growth needs across 28 trades, including sectors vital to the countrys economic development.
As a result, enrollment at TVET institutions has risen dramatically from 25,091 students in 2020 to 73,434 in 2024.
Where vocational education was once viewed as a less attractive alternative to university, the initiative has removed barriers to access and created an aspirational environment for young people, including women who were previously underrepresented.
Today, TVET is recognised as a gateway to opportunity, equipping students with practical skills and digital literacy for employment and entrepreneurship in key industries.
Phase two of the initiative, now underway, will further expand and modernise vocational training at the polytechnic level, introducing advanced workshops and laboratories to meet the demands of Ghanas evolving economy.
The ISS African Futures study projects that, with continued investment in economic diversification, Ghanas economy could grow at an average rate of 9% from 2025 to 2043, raising GDP per capita and lifting millions out of poverty.
Transforming the TVET sector is central to this vision, providing the skilled workforce needed for industrialisation, value addition, and sustainable growth.
As new graduates step into key industries, the positive impact of the governments efforts will resonate throughout the Ghanaian economy, advancing national goals for industrialisation and inclusive growth.
The ongoing transformation of Ghanas vocational education system is opening doors for the next generation and laying the groundwork for sustained prosperity, concluded Sanjeev Mansotra.

About the ECOWAS Brown Card Insurance Scheme
The ECOWAS Brown Card Scheme, was introduced in 1982, following the signing of the ECOWAS Brown Card Protocol by the ECOWAS Heads of State with the primary objective to facilitate the free movement of people, goods and services, across the sub-region.
The scheme is expected to facilitate prompt and fair compensation payment to victims of motor accidents caused by non-citizen motorists from member countries.
It is a territorial extension of the motor third party liability insurance, which enables motorists to travel freely within the ECOWAS Brown Card region.
A System for settlement of claims
It is a common system for the settlement of motor insurance claims arising from international motor vehicular accidents. The initiative is expected to enhance trade harmony among member countries, particularly with regard to the laws and regulations on motor accident liability.
Automatic Brown Card for motor policyholders
It is important to state that Ghana became the first Anglophone country to join the Francophone countries to issue Brown Cards automatically to all motor insurance policyholders. Indeed, the Francophone countries in the sub-region blazed the trail in this regard.

Atuabo climaxes annual Kundum festival with durbar and fanfare,"Correspondence from Western Region
The Chiefs and people of the Eastern Nzema Traditional Area, under the distinguished patronage of His Royal Majesty Awulae Blay IX, Paramount Chief of the area, have climaxed their annual Kundum festival at a grand durbar with a call on traditional rulers and people in the area to foster peace and unity to spearhead the development of the area.
The week-long celebration was on the theme, ""Preserving Our Heritage, Protecting Our Environment, United In Peace For Sustainable Development.""
Speaking at the colorful event, which brought together almost all traditional rulers in the Eastern Nzema Traditional Area to the Atuabo Paramountcy, Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah, Member of Parliament (MP) for Ellembelle, who was the guest of honour, stressed the need for traditional rulers to foster peace and unity to propel the rapid socio-economic development of Ellembelle.
He acknowledged that the 2025 Atuabo Kundum festival wasuniquee adding that ""the unity of almost all the traditional rulers in Ellembelle who paid homage to the new Paramount Chief, testified that Ellembelle was charting a common path in peace and development.""
Armah-Kofi Buah reminded the chiefs and people of the area that before the government would bring development to the area, peace and unity would be considered.
He stressed the need to preserve the Nzema culture, especially the Nzema language.
Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah, who doubles as the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources and the Ag Minister of Environment Science and Technology, reiterated the need for traditional rulers to team up with the government to protect river bodies, forest reserves, and the land from wanton degradation by illegal mining activities popularly called galamsey.
""About 80% of the water we drink meanders through the forest, so destroying the forest and water bodies with toxic chemicals means we are all on the verge of dying.""
The Minister said the government of President John Dramani Mahama did not abhor mining but cherished sustainable and responsible mining, which would not pollute river bodies with chemicals and degrade the land and forest reserves.
On steps taken so far, Armah-Kofi Buah said the Ministry had launched the responsible Cooperative Mining and Skills Development Programme (COMSDEP) at Teleku-Bokazo, which would be rolled out very soon as the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and the Minerals Commission embark upon sensitisation in the communities on how and where they could do mining without polluting river bodies and forest reserves.
The Minister warned that those who had vowed to do galamsey in the River Ankobra would be dealt with severely by the soldiers.
His Royal Majesty, Awulae Blay IX, the Paramount Chief of the Eastern Nzema Traditional Area, who was earlier paraded through the principal streets of Atuabo for the first time, expressed gratitude to God Almighty, the chiefs, and people for the love, unity, and support he had witnessed since his enstoolment.
He said Ellembelle must rise above chieftaincy disputes and political differences and move ahead in development.
""Our resources must be directed at education at education, healthcare, infrastructure, and youth empowerment.""
The Paramount Chief said, ""Through the HRM Awulae Blay IX Foundation, we have begun supporting brilliant but needy students to ensure that every child in Ellembelle has the opportunity to learn and succeed.""
He reminded chiefs and people of Ellembelle to see festivals as a time to renew their commitment to peace, good neighborliness, and development of the Paramountcy.
Awulae Blay IX said the theme for the occasion reminded the people of their collective responsibility to ensure a healthy and symbolic relationship with man and nature.
""Our heritage defines who we are. It is our language, our festivals, our respect for elders, and our deep sense of community. To preserve it means to uphold the values that have sustained us for generations.""
Awulae Blay IX, who is also the President of the Eastern Nzema Traditional Council, added that ""the environment is part of that heritage; the rivers that give us water, the forests that provide medicine and food, the land that supports our farmers and the sea that sustains our fisher folks.""
He acknowledged that ""Ellembelle is  blessed with rich natural resources such as gold, oil, gas, fertile lands and river, yet these blessings were turning into a curse because a few greedy ones have sworn to sacrifice our health and environment for money.""
""Illegal mining known as galamsey is evil and must be stopped now before we all perish. What is the value of a billion dollars to a nation if its citizens are sick and dying from the poison of galamsey activities?""
""Our farmlands are being destroyed. Our forests are disappearing. Our rivers are polluted. I say this with pain in my heart. Ellembelke is fast becoming a hub of galamsey, and this cannot continue under my watch as the Paramount Chief and Overlord.""
Awulae Blay IX entreated all chiefs and queen mothers in Ellembelle to join in the fight against galamsey to protect what was bequeathed to them by their ancestors.
Joseph Agyekum, District Chief Executive (DCE) for Ellembelle, pleaded with chiefs and queen mothers to help the Assembly push the development of Ellembelle.
He said the NDC government had employed about 600 youth of Ellembelle in the last nine months.
Agyekum called for unity to allow investors and companies to invest in Ellembelle, reminding them that ""with division, no company will invest in the area.""
The DCE said galamsey was a clarion call and appealed to them to assist the Minister of Lands and Natural Resources to clamp down on illegal miners.
Agyekum said all excavators at galamsey sites in Ellembelle have been removed.
He said the flagship responsible Cooperative Mining and Skills Development Programme (COMSDEP) will soon be rolled out at Teleku-Bokazo and Anwia, which is expected to employ 6,000 local people in the area.
Nana Nyamekeh Fofole, Chief of Ampain and a member of the Standing Committee, thanked all chiefs and queen mothers in Ellembelle who honoured the invitation to pay special homage to the new Paramount Chief.
According to him, the occasion was ""unique as Ellembelle had pulled down the old garment for a new one.""", Daniel Kaku,Regional, 14 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Atuabo-climaxes-annual-Kundum-festival-with-durbar-and-fanfare-2009477

Aowin impostors arrested for fuelling illegal mining under guise of task force,"Ten armed men who falsely posed as members of Ghanas official Anti-Galamsey Task Force have been arrested in the Nyankamam-Armori Forest Reserve in the Aowin Municipality of the Western North Region.
The operation, conducted by the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS), uncovered a criminal network that had been extorting money from illegal miners while claiming to be enforcing anti-galamsey directives.
According to reports confirmed by JoyNews, the suspects  all heavily armed and carrying traditional charms  were arrested after weeks of surveillance. They allegedly claimed to be working under the authority of the Aowin Paramount Chief, a claim that officials have since dismissed as false.
These individuals were not part of any recognised task force. Their actions not only encouraged illegal mining but also risked eroding public confidence in legitimate operations, a NAIMOS official stated.
Preliminary investigations suggest that the group had been collecting protection fees from galamsey operators, allowing them to continue mining in restricted forest areas.
Authorities believe the fake operatives were part of a broader pattern in which criminal groups exploit the governments anti-galamsey efforts to extort money from miners and communities.
The arrests underscore the growing challenge of impersonation and corruption within the fight against illegal mining**, which continues to devastate forests, farmlands, and water bodies across Ghana.
NAIMOS has urged residents, miners, and community leaders in the Aowin area to be vigilant and report anyone posing as a task force member without proper identification or authorisation.
We will not tolerate individuals who take advantage of government interventions for personal gain, the Secretariat warned in a statement. The fight against galamsey is a national responsibility, and integrity must remain at its core.
The suspects remain in police custody as investigations continue.", Kay Agbenyega,Regional, 13 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Aowin-impostors-arrested-for-fuelling-illegal-mining-under-guise-of-task-force-2009365

"Dr Boako condemns mass arrests, calls for respect of human rights in Ahafo operation","The Member of Parliament for Tano North in the Ahafo Region, Dr Gideon Boako, has strongly condemned the recent military swoop and mass arrests of residents in connection with the attack on officials of the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
In a statement, Dr Boako described the arrests and subsequent repatriation of residents to Kumasi as unacceptable and unjust.
While reaffirming his condemnation of any violence or attacks on state officials performing their duties, the MP urged the security services to act within the bounds of the law and uphold the fundamental human rights of citizens.
The response by the security agencies must be measured, lawful, and respect the fundamental human rights of the citizens we represent, he said.
Dr Boako argued that the sweeping arrests without proper investigations risked punishing innocent citizens alongside the guilty.
He insisted that every individual arrested must be subjected to a transparent and prompt investigation to determine their culpability, if any.
The focus should be on identifying and prosecuting the true perpetrators of the attack, not subjecting an entire community to collective punishment, he emphasised.
The lawmaker appealed to the people of Hwediem to remain calm and cooperate with lawful investigations while urging the government and security agencies to ensure that the pursuit of justice does not turn into an act of injustice.",,Regional, 13 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Dr-Boako-condemns-mass-arrests-calls-for-respect-of-human-rights-in-Ahafo-operation-2009348
"Dr Essien commends Mahama, Buah, EPA boss others for united front against galamsey","The Deputy Director in charge of Mining at the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), Dr Patrick Essien has highly commended President
John Dramani Mahama
, Minister for Lands and Natural Resources,
Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah
; EPA Chief Executive Officer, Professor Nana Ama Browne Klutse; and the Chief Executive Officer of the Minerals Commission (MinCom) for their relentless and coordinated efforts in tackling illegal mining (galamsey) across the country.
Dr Essien praised the governments comprehensive approach to dealing with galamsey, noting that the new strategies being implemented are already showing signs of progress and could achieve more than expected in the fight against the menace.
""Galamsey possesses one of the greatest threats to Ghanas environment, especially our water bodies. It is, therefore, crucial that we find a lasting solution through unity commitment and actions from all sectors of the society,"" he stated.

He particularly praised President Mahama for his recent stakeholder engagement at the Jubilee House, describing it as a step in the right direction toward a sustainable national strategy against illegal mining.
He also acknowledged the role of Goldbod, whose initiative to ensure that gold buyers are licensed and permitted by EPA. This represents a bold and practical step in sanitising Ghanas gold trade chain.
""No one can be left out in this galamsey fight. Traditional leaders, politicians, and stakeholders must unite to champion the course for the benefit our nation,"" he emphasised.
Commending the EPAs own proactive measures, Dr Essien applauded the establishment of EPA offices at major ports, a move aimed at monitoring and regulating the importation of mining equipment and chemicals into the country.
He also extended commendations to the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, the Water Resources Commission, and the Forestry Commission for their collective and individual efforts in combating illegal mining across Ghana.
Dr Essien further highlighted the importance of job creation in sustaining the gains made against galamsey.
He called on the government to expand Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) opportunities to equip the youth with employable skills, reducing their dependence on illegal mining as a means of livelihood.
Dr Essien concluded by reaffirming the EPAs unwavering commitment to supporting the governments agenda to protect the environment, preserve natural resources, and restore degraded lands for future generations.", Alex Boye,Regional, 13 November 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/regional/Dr-Essien-commends-Mahama-Buah-EPA-boss-others-for-united-front-against-galamsey-2009347
