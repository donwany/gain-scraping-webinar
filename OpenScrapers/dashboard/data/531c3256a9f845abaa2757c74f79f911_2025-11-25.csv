Will your campaign for NPP Gen. Secretary be coordinated overseas? Gbande questions Ursula Owusu,"Deputy Director of Operations at the Jubilee House, Mustapha Gbande, has questioned Ursula Owusu’s quest to become the General Secretary of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). According to him, it is shocking that the former Communications Minister, who has relocated from Ghana, will announce her intention to contest for such a sensitive position in the New Patriotic Party (NPP). He wants to know if her campaign will be coordinated from  her base out of the country. “URSULA Owusu ESq. I have been informed that you intend to run for the position of General Secretary. Will your campaign be coordinated overseas, through social media, or at the grassroots level? Your offense is comparable to that of KOA,” he quizzed. It will be remembered that during her birthday, Ursula Owusu announced that she will be contesting for the general secretary seat of the opposition NPP. She argued during the announcement that she has what it takes to prepare the party for the battle ahead. Ursula Owusu noted that the current government came to power by lying its way in and therefore the NPP is in pole position to wrestle away power.

This led to many of the bottlenecks we saw.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

An individual who concedes defeat before ECs declaration does not deserve any leadership roleKen Agyapong,"Flagbearer hopeful, Kennedy Agyapong, has chided Dr Mahamudu Bawumia and his team for conceding defeat early in the 2024 elections. He believes that the former flagbearer does not deserve a leadership role because of that act, which led several Members of Parliament for the New Patriotic Party to lose their seat. “You cannot rush to concede defeat before counting is done and cause our MPs to lose seats, then expect leadership again. Not today, not tomorrow,” he said to a roaring crowd in the Western Region. The former legislator noted that he has been a subject of insults and attacks, but has decided not to toe that line because of unity in the NPP. However, if he is dared, he will roar and they will not like what will happen in the political party. “A lion may remain calm for the sake of unity, but it fears no one. I have endured the insults and attacks in silence, but the day I choose to speak, you will know there are real men in this party”. A lion may remain calm for the sake of unity, but it fears no one.

Stop the too much talk and deliver on your mandate  Mahamas appointees told,"Managing Director for the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA), Sulemana Braimah has urged government appointees to deliver on the job they’ve been given and stop the plenty talk. According to him, the real test will be the subsequent years in office and not just the first year. Making this position known in a social media post, Sulemana Braimah noted that with everyone in the party thinking they deserve to be flagbearer, the country will await to see what they have in stock for the remaining years. His comments comes on the back of Deputy Finance Minister’s claim that John Dramani Mahama’s second term will end without a scandal. He said “Only yesterday, I had a chat with a big person in the NDC who said he was worried that appointees of the government are “talking” too much. I agreed with him. I think appointees should just deliver and let their works speak for them and stop the too much talk. The first year of every government will appear to be good. The real test is in the subsequent years. With everyone thinking they can and deserve to be flagbearer of the NDC for 2028, we wait to see. Let’s see how the rest of the year goes”.

Tamale High Court Ruling: Im not scared of a re-run  NPPs Mathew Nyindam,"New Patriotic Party’s (NPP’s)  Hon. Matthew Nyindam has insisted that he remains the legitimate Member of Parliament (MP)  for Kpandai despite the High Court’s decision ordering a re-run of the parliamentary election within 30 days. Addressing the media after the ruling on Monday, November 24, 2025, he maintained that he won the contest convincingly and is fully prepared to defend his mandate. Hon Nyindam revealed that he and his legal team have already filed a notice of appeal and a stay of execution, signalling their intention to challenge the judgment. According to Nyindam, even before the ruling, signs were clear that his opponents expected a favourable outcome.“For about a week, our opponents were jubilating in Kpandai, saying all manner of things. They behaved as though they already knew the outcome,” he said. However, he stressed that despite the political tension surrounding the case, his side chose to remain lawful and patient.“As law-abiding citizens, we respect the judge’s ruling. But we vehemently disagree with the decision,” he stated. Nyindam maintains that the election results clearly affirmed his victory.“I won the election with a margin of 3,734 votes; that is a decisive and undeniable victory,” he argued. He added that both parties possessed identical pink sheets, all confirming his win.“I have my 152 pink sheets, and they also have their 152. When you put them together, it is clear that we won. Every party agreed on what was recorded at the polling stations,” he explained. Nyindam alleged that the NDC went to court with hopes of leveraging state influence rather than relying on facts.“They knew the numbers were not in their favour, so they decided to come to court hoping to use state power to tilt the system,” he claimed. He said the NDC challenged 41 polling stations, but described these same stations as areas where he had secured strong margins. Nyindam expressed confidence in Ghana’s judicial procedures and reiterated his belief that the appeal will overturn the ruling.“We are in a country governed by laws. If a lower court gives a ruling you don’t agree with, you have the right to go higher. We have done the needful and filed our appeal,” he said. He described the current situation as unprecedented in Ghana’s electoral history.“The attempt to use state power to coerce the system is worrying. This is the first time we are seeing something like this,” he added. Despite his disagreement with the ruling, Nyindam said he is not afraid of going back to the polls. “I am still the MP for Kpandai, and I am not afraid of a re-run. If it comes to that, the people will confirm the mandate they gave me,” he declared confidently.  Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

They can enter or exit without being flagged  Manasseh exposes OSP,"Journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has released detailed travel records of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta and Ernest Darko Akore, highlighting security gaps he says exist because the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) did not formally request that either man be placed on the national stop-list. According to information he gathered from the Ghana Immigration Service and other security agencies, Ofori-Atta departed Ghana on January 4, 2025, via United Airlines Flight 997 to Washington, D.C., travelling on a Ghanaian passport with valid visas to the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Azure further noted that Akore left the country earlier, on November 19, 2024, on Delta Airlines Flight 156 to New York, using a ten-year U.S. passport that remains valid until 2031. He explained that without a stop-list directive, border officials cannot legally prevent the two from entering or exiting the country. Security officers interviewed also questioned the OSP’s reliance on airline manifests, saying such data often arrives too late to be operationally effective. Azure warned that while Ofori-Atta’s public profile makes unnoticed re-entry unlikely, Akore could move through airports or land borders undetected. He added that security agencies cannot be blamed for any failure to arrest the two since no institution has instructed them to take action, even as the OSP pursues Interpol assistance. He said his intervention aims to provide factual clarity as public debate intensifies about accountability in the SML matter and the OSP’s approach to enforcement.

Do not shiver; Im in control  Kpandai NPP MP reassures constituents,"Member of Parliament for Kpandai, Matthew has asked supporters of the New Patriotic Party not to shiver. According to him, he will explore all legal means to ensure that their votes in the 2024 election count. In a post shared via social media after a ruling by a Tamale High Court quashed the 2024 election, he urged his supporters not to weaver or be perturbed. Meanwhile, Lawyer Sylvester Nsang, representing the NPP MP for Kpandai, Matthew Nyindam, has confirmed that his client has filed a notice of appeal following a High Court ruling ordering a re-run of the election within 30 days. Speaking on November 24, 2025, immediately after the ruling, Nsang said while the legal team believes the petition leading to the re-run was “frivolous,” they respect the court’s decision. “We strongly disagree with the judgment, and we have already shown our agreement by filing a competent notice of appeal, and we’ve added a motion for execution,” he said. Nsang noted that all procedural steps have been followed. “The petitioner has been served with the process, and he decided to throw it away, but that’s proper service,” he added. “The lawyer stressed that the next step is for the Court of Appeal to review the evidence on record.

NPP legal team challenges basis of Kpandai election re-run order,"The legal team for the NPP MP for Kpandai constituency, Matthew Nyindam, has raised concerns about the basis of the High Court ruling ordering a parliamentary election re-run. Lawyer Sylvester Nsang said the evidence on record does not support invalidating the results. Nsang told reporters, “For example, the evidence on the record is that everyone was given a copy of the pink sheet. “Now, the evidence on the record is that there was violence at the initially designated coalition center, which is Pandai, and once there was violence, the EC has the right to relocate the center.” He questioned the court’s decision in light of regulations allowing elections to continue even if a candidate or agent is absent from a polling location. Nsang pointed out that claims of irregularities at 41 police stations involved only about 500 votes, which would not have affected the overall election outcome. “Commonsensically, if you take that 500 votes and add it to the petitioner, he will still not win the elections. So, on what basis would a court announce results?” Nsang asked. He added that the next step is to pursue the appeal process, expressing confidence that the Court of Appeal will conduct a thorough review of the evidence.

Matthew Nyindam appeals rerun decision by Tamale High Court,"Matthew Nyindam, the sitting Member of Parliament for Kpandai, has filed both a notice of appeal and an application for a stay of execution against the Tamale High Court’s decision ordering a rerun of the parliamentary elections in the constituency. The High Court had directed that a fresh election be held within 30 days, citing procedural irregularities at the collation centre during the original poll. The ruling, which favoured NDC candidate Daniel Nsala Wakpal, concluded that the breaches undermined his right to fully participate in the electoral process. By lodging his appeal, Mr. Nyindam aims to overturn the court’s decision and suspend the rerun until the outcome of the appeal is determined. Meanwhile, reacting to the verdict, the NDC’s Deputy Director of Elections, Rashid Tanko, popularly known as Computer, expressed profound gratitude to the court for “giving the people of Kpandai justice.” According to him, the judgment confirms the NDC’s long-standing position that certain electoral officers attempted to manipulate the will of the people. “We have said it several times that some crooked electoral officers are bent on stealing the people’s mandate, and today one of them has been fully exposed,” he stated. Rashid Tanko asserted that the Kpandai seat rightfully belonged to the NDC in the 2024 elections but was “rigged through fraudulent collusion.” He accused both compromised officers and their political collaborators of orchestrating an outcome that did not reflect the true votes. He cited the provisions of CI 127, particularly Regulation 43 (1A–H), which outlines the proper procedure for collating parliamentary results. “Collation is done using Forms 1C and 1D, you assemble all polling station results on Form 1C, transfer them to Form 1D, and then declare. But this was never done. They simply gathered themselves, ran to Tamale, cooked results, and announced a fake MP,” he alleged. Tanko emphasized that the NDC chose the lawful route to reclaim what he described as a stolen mandate.  Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

The ruling, delivered by His Lordship Emmanuel Brew Plange, nullified the previous results in December 2024  and directed that voters in Kpandai Constituency return to the polls. Reacting to the verdict, the NDC’s Deputy Director of Elections, Rashid Tanko, popularly known as Computer, expressed profound gratitude to the court for “giving the people of Kpandai justice.” According to him, the judgment confirms the NDC’s long-standing position that certain electoral officers attempted to manipulate the will of the people. “We have said it several times that some crooked electoral officers are bent on stealing the people’s mandate, and today one of them has been fully exposed,” he stated.

He assured the people of Kpandai that the NDC was ready to “win the seat decisively” and deliver effective representation. “We will ensure victory for the NDC, and we will give the people of Kpandai the proper representation they deserve,” he concluded.

Did she have any problems with Akufo-Addo? Why blame Bawumia   Queen exposes Naa Torshie,"Deputy Director of Communications of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Jennifer Oforiwaah Queen has taken on Irene Naa Torshie Addo for blaming former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia for alleged failings of the erstwhile NPP government when she appeared to have no issues with President Akufo-Addo, who was the leader of the administration and who appointed her to a ‘juicy’ position. Ms Addo, who is opposed to the candidature of Dr Bawumia to the flagbearership position of the NPP, had launched a scathing criticism of him, blaming him for the economic difficulties of the erstwhile administration and the failure of it to promptly release the Common Fund to various districts. But Mr Oforiwaah Queen has wondered why she is putting the blame on Dr Bawumia after having enjoyed her juicy position without incident. She accused Ms Addo of being cruel and vindictive and failing to help any female NPP supporters who approached her for support. “The question is, was she having problems with the president who gave her the juicy appointment? Why apportion the blame on his vice then? Come to think of it, how many female communicators did this woman help when we were in power? She was one of the cruel and vindictive women who never opened her door to any lady or gave access to even have a conversation with her. She should continue and she will get a proper response from the ladies in the party, ” Ms Oforiwaah Queen wrote. The campaign for the flagbearership position of the NPP, especially the camps of Dr Bawumia and Kennedy Agyapong, has led to the camps trading accusations and insults.Ms Addo is in Kennedy Agyapong’s camp and is allegedly being considered to be his vice presidential candidate should Kennedy Agyapong win the primaries.

The Office of the Special Prosecutor was supposed to arraign former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta and seven others today in a case involving 78 counts of corruption and corruption-related offences.

Sory Criticizes Supreme Courts Rapid Decision Backing Afenyo-Markin,"Legal practitioner Thaddeus Sory has alleged that personal interests, rather than national considerations, influenced the actions of Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin during matters relating to the petition against former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkonoo. Sory claimed that Afenyo-Markin’s involvement had implications for fairness and transparency. He recounted that his client’s petition referenced Afenyo-Markin directly. “The Minority Leader was one of the reasons why my client petitioned for the removal of the then Chief Justice. There was a huge count which mentioned his name and mentioned the acts that formed the basis of our petition,” he said on The KSM Show. Sory also questioned the speed at which the Supreme Court granted reliefs to Afenyo-Markin. “We said he had set a precedent… by being the only person who, within two hours, was able to get a full panel of the Supreme Court… to give him orders that… no court in the world of the common law jurisdiction will give him,” he noted. He added that concerns emerged about the relationship between Afenyo-Markin and the Chief Justice. “People who knew the two of them spoke to me, and said, ‘Don’t you understand that is his sister’,” Sory said. When KSM asked, “Sister, in terms of what?” Sory responded, “That they come from the same place. Two, when her father died, the Minority Leader hosted her visitors.” Sory further alleged that Afenyo-Markin had commercial interests connected to the judiciary. “There is now information coming out that services are being rendered in the judicial service which are linked to Afenyo-Markin. He’s rendering those services and getting commercial profits from them, and huge ones,” he claimed. He argued that these concerns undermine the public posture adopted by the Minority Leader. “It has nothing to do with a minority position… he has an interest in her being there,” Sory said, adding that this interest explained why Afenyo-Markin appeared “louder than every other person.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Ghanas vetting process is a joke  Thaddeus Sory,"Private legal practitioner Thaddeus Sory has raised concerns about the credibility and usefulness of Parliament’s vetting process for Chief Justice nominees. In an interview with KSM on The KSM Show, he argued that recent proceedings suggest the exercise has drifted from its constitutional purpose. Sory said the process has become unnecessarily politicised and at times disrespectful to nominees. “Apart from the disrespect to the nominee, it even went further to affect another justice, the most senior justice of the day, Justice Gabriel Pwamang, who was the chairman of the committee that recommended that the Chief Justice be removed,” he stated. He criticised Justice Pwamang’s handling of the committee’s work, saying, “To some extent, I would blame Justice Pwamang because… his own report is the problem.” According to him, the current form of vetting does not reflect what the Constitution prescribes. “I think they should… They should look at this whole idea of prior approval. The Constitution didn’t say vetting. It said prior approval of Parliament,” he argued. He suggested that Parliament adopt a streamlined approach focused on background checks and specific clarifications rather than lengthy questioning sessions aired on national television. Sory described the current process as ineffective. “They keep all of us glued to television, and we are sitting down there and watching a process that 95% of it is a joke,” he said. He believes nominees should be approved by acclamation where appropriate, with accountability enforced through the authority of the appointing body.

The helicopter crash was preventable -Peter Ankomah,"A renewed push by the government to acquire new presidential aircraft has ignited strong public reactions, with journalist Peter Ankomah calling out what he describes as political inconsistency and a preventable tragedy. Speaking on Movement TV, he said the national conversation around presidential jets has been shaped less by principle and more by which party is in power at a given time. Ankomah recalled the heated opposition that greeted the idea of a new jet when the NPP government, under President Nana Akufo-Addo, proposed it years ago. He quoted then, opposition communicator Sammy Gyamfi’s appearance on Joy FM’s Newsfile on October 2, 2021, where he condemned the proposal as “misplaced priority” and “an insult to our sensibilities.” He also pointed to similar remarks by Haruna Iddrisu, current Minister of Education, who criticised the plan as reckless expenditure that ignored ordinary Ghanaians’ hardship. According to him, the current administration appears determined to go ahead with acquiring new aircraft, regardless of opposition support. While he believes some upgrades are necessary, he suggested a more modest approach: perhaps one jet and two helicopters, instead of multiple aircraft, given Ghana’s economic situation. But the heart of his criticism centred on the recent military helicopter crash that claimed lives earlier this year. Ankomah described the deaths as avoidable, stressing that the aircraft was reportedly faulty and should never have been cleared for flight. He questioned why the available report from Accra was considered sufficient, when there was no corresponding report from Kumasi, the destination, before takeoff. He further expressed concern about the timing of the crash report’s release, noting that it came just two days before the national budget was read. In his view, the release appeared to pave the way for a fresh argument in favour of acquiring new aircraft. Ankomah argued that Ghana cannot continue losing lives and resources to preventable failures and shifting political positions. For him, the issues of safety, accountability, and honesty must take precedence over political convenience, especially when human lives are involved.

Afenyo-Markin was one of the reasons why I petitioned for the removal of TorkornooThaddeus Sory,"Legal practitioner Thaddeus Sory has disclosed that the Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo Markin, was one of the reasons why his client petitioned the president for the removal of the former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo. According to him, the minority leader, through the support of the former Chief Justice, was able to, in two hours, get the Supreme Court to empanel to give orders that no court in the common law jurisdiction will give. Thaddeus Sory was speaking to KSM on the KSM Show when he made these allegations. “The minority leader was one of the reasons why I petitioned, or my client petitioned, for the removal of the Chief Justice. There was a huge count, which mentioned his name and mentioned the acts that formed the basis of our petition. What was this count? We said he had set a precedent, in fact a record in the court, by being the only person who within two hours was able to get a full panel of the supreme court presided over by the erstwhile Chief Justice to give him orders that by the scope of the application before the court, no court in the world of the common law jurisdiction will give him”. He continued, “In the course of those proceedings and after, people who knew the two of them spoke to me, and they said don’t you understand, that is his sister. The removed chief justice is his sister. One they come from the same place, and two when her father died, the minority leader hosted her visitors and people who were there called me. There is now information coming out that there are services being rendered in the judicial service which are linked to Afenyo Markin. He is rendering those services and getting commercial profit from them, huge ones”. To him, Afenyo Markin’s fight for the former Chief Justice is not for any form of national interest but rather for his personal interest. “It as nothing to do with a minority position, he sold it out to his colleagues that we have to take a collective position against this, but it is a personal interest. The fact that we have showed that you have an interest in her being there, and so he is crying louder than everyone because he has an interest in the woman being there,” he stated.

Confusion rocks Effutu NDC as 2024 Parliamentary Candidate snubs MCE at a funeral,"A growing rift within the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Effutu Constituency of the Central Region played out publicly on Saturday, November 8, 2025, when the party’s 2024 Parliamentary Candidate, James Kofi Annan, visibly declined a handshake from the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), Hon. Rev. Atta Mensah, during a funeral in Winneba. The incident occurred at the burial ceremony of the late brother of the Constituency Youth Organiser, Albert Nana Benyin Bonney, where both party leaders were in attendance. A video that has since gone viral captured the moment Mr Annan blocked the MCE’s extended hand, leaving mourners and party supporters in shock. The dramatic scene further highlighted what many describe as a deepening division within the constituency branch of the NDC, with supporters increasingly split along lines of loyalty to the two prominent figures. In a subsequent interview on his radio station, Nyce FM, Mr Annan explained his action, stating that the MCE had earlier arrived at the funeral and greeted everyone seated except him. According to him, the earlier snub informed his decision not to reciprocate the gesture later in the day. Residents and party faithful in Winneba have since expressed disappointment over the public display of discord, criticising both leaders for what they say was an avoidable show of immaturity. Many lament that such incidents only reinforce internal fractures and undermine efforts to strengthen the party ahead of future political activities. Observers warn that the growing tensions, if left unresolved, could weaken the NDC’s organisational unity in Effutu and jeopardise its electoral prospects. Meanwhile, calls are mounting for the regional and national leadership of the party to intervene and restore calm among the feuding leaders. The Effutu NDC has yet to issue an official statement on the matter.  Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Go and see their faces; they are now looking younger, and everybody is happy. When you see them so, so happy in the sense that there was single-digit inflation in eleven months. Today, the dollar to a cedi is 10.9. Plenty of money; nobody is pricing in dollars. They don’t want the dollar; if you bring the dollar, they will tell you to go and change it into cedis. Houses are now being priced in cedis, and cars are now being priced in cedis. Why? Because “Aban papa Aba,” he said.

Our policies help create jobs dailyRashid Pelpuo,"Labour, Jobs and Employment Minister Rashid Pelpuo has stated emphatically that because of the government’s policies and programs, jobs are created every day. According to him, the government has created an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, hence inviting investors to willingly invest in the country. He says more investors are trooping into the country than previously because they are certain that the government has fixed the economy for the growth of the private sector. “Jobs are created in this country every day because of the policies we run. We ensure that people can now go outside the country, buy and come invest, and will not have to go back regretting that when they came, the dollar has risen against the cedi in a manner that has made their profit gone. Once that happens, they keep the jobs, they keep expanding, and once they expand, they absorb more people, and once they absorb more people, jobs are created,” he explained on Accra-based GH One Television.

Trust in the Special Prosecutor is eroding  Lawyer Dzimega,"Ghanaian barrister and solicitor who is also a law lecturer, Lawyer Theophilus Dzimega Jnr has raised concerns about public trust in the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) during a discussion on JoyPrime’s Newsfile, hosted by Samson Lardy Anyenini on Saturday, Speaking on the topic “OSP in the Eye of the Storm”, Dzimega Jnr argued that the office faces credibility issues, noting that many Ghanaians do not fully trust the SP’s actions due to their inaction. Speaking in the context of the high-profile case against former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, he questioned why similar cases have seen suspects interviewed, yet Ofori-Atta was allowed to travel abroad without an interview. “If the people knew what they were about, why did they allow him to travel?” he asked. He suggested that preliminary interviews could have been conducted to prevent Ofori-Atta from leaving the country. In another development on the increasing galamsey menace, Lawyer Dzimega Jnr emphasised that punishment and deterrence are essential components of preventative measures. He argued that illegal mining must be tackled comprehensively, from all angles, to ensure that environmental degradation and national security risks are effectively addressed.

"Corruption, tribalism and conformity threaten Ghana  Afoko warns","Renowned Businessman, Mr Awentami Paul Afoko, has urged young Ghanaians to adopt the courage of non-conformists, warning that Ghana’s progress depends on citizens who are willing to stand out, resist societal pressure, and question decisions before they are accepted. Speaking at the fifth Dialogue Public Lecture held at the Ama Ata Aidoo Centre for Creative Writing at the African University of Communications and Business (AUCB) on November 21, 2025, Afoko said true national transformation will not come from people who simply “join the chorus,” but from those bold enough to challenge norms and refuse to be intimidated by fear or power. “Living as a non-conformist in a conformist world means refusing to be swallowed by the crowd,” he told the audience. “The ability to question actions before they happen is the trait the youth must adopt if Ghana truly wants progress.” Afoko argued that although non-conformists often face difficulties, those challenges are the very struggles nations need in order to grow. He cautioned that widespread corruption and the persistence of tribalism remain threats to national development. “Corruption is everywhere, but when corruption becomes normal and tribalism becomes fashionable, then we have a problem,” he said. “Sadly, tribalism is still around. That is why the youth must stand out and speak the truth even when it is hardest to do so.” He stressed that silence from the country’s brightest minds creates space for mediocrity to dominate public life. “If the distinguished minds of this country keep quiet, mediocrity will take over,” Afoko warned. “And when that happens, the entire nation loses.” Calling on the youth to recognise the responsibility of standing out, he emphasised that non-conformity is not arrogance, but duty. “Standing out is being responsible,” he noted. “You might not be noticed today, but you will be noticed eventually. The future belongs to those who refuse to be swallowed by the crowd.” Afoko added that conformity kills innovation, justice, growth and progress, and cautioned that if mediocrity becomes acceptable, the country risks disaster, as intellectuals would then rely on mediocre voices to make laws and policies shaping national destiny. His message reinforced the broader theme of the public lecture: that Ghana’s future depends on courageous citizens willing to challenge harmful norms, defend integrity, and insist on accountability.

"Afoko shares personal story of arrest, exile and the power of conviction","Former New Patriotic Party (NPP) National Chairman,  Awentami Paul Afoko, says civic courage remains the “prime ingredient” for national progress, insisting that defending principles, speaking truth to power, and protecting democracy must never be treated as partisan or ideological acts, but as moral duties. Delivering his address at the fifth Dialogue Public Lecture held at the Ama Ata Aidoo Centre for Creative Writing at the African University of Communications and Business (AUCB) on November 21, 2025, Afoko stressed that civic courage is the strength to declare wrongdoing even at personal cost. “Civic courage is the willingness to defend principles even when it is dangerous, to speak truth even when truth is unwelcoming,” he noted. “It is what holds a nation together, because it is rooted in moral fibre, not political colours.” According to him, while academic discussions often portray courage as clean and heroic, real life demands a deeper, riskier form of truth-telling that often comes with heavy consequences. To illustrate, Afoko recounted his own experience during the 1981 coup that returned the late Jerry John Rawlings to power. At the time, he publicly challenged the legitimacy of the takeover and insisted that power be returned to the democratically elected president, Dr. Hilla Liman, even though he did not belong to Liman’s party, the PNP. His stance, he said, was guided not by political alignment but by conviction and a sense of justice. Afoko’s open criticism led to his arrest and detention without trial. He was later imprisoned and eventually fled the country, spending nearly two decades in exile. He only returned when the political atmosphere became safer. “Speaking up is expensive,” he told the audience, “but keeping silent is more expensive. Silence would have betrayed my conviction, and it would have opened a dangerous gate that could have harmed the country.” He explained that his stance contributed to widening the national space for dissent and open criticism, a foundation that later supported Ghana’s beginning of multi-party democracy. From his experience, Afoko said he learned that courage shapes nations “more than fear ever will,” urging young Ghanaians to resist silence when democratic values are threatened.

Dr. Arthur Kennedy questions Akufo-Addos accountability,"Political activist and NPP member Dr. Arthur Kennedy has called for greater accountability from former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo regarding the conduct of his appointees, arguing that leadership must answer for failures that occurred under its watch. Dr. Kennedy said discussions about wrongdoing within the previous administration must go beyond individual ministers. “If we are talking about the sins of Ken Ofori-Atta, he was reporting to somebody. I think that, at some point, we need to be asking the former president (Akufo-Addo) what he was doing while his ministers were looting our coffers. He has a moral responsibility to address some of these issues,” he stated on JoyNews’ Newsfile. He criticised what he described as a pattern of political protection offered to those in power, arguing that incumbency often shields public officials from proper scrutiny. “We need to move away from a system where being an incumbent seems to insulate you from judicial processes, allowing you to act with impunity,” he said. Dr. Kennedy further warned that the current political culture risks turning Ghana’s democratic cycle into alternating periods of unchecked authority. “In effect, we appear to be practising a serial one-party dictatorship that lasts for a four- or eight-year term, after which another party comes in to make noise about it,” he added.

Bail shouldnt be weaponised  Lawyer  Hassan Tampuli calls out  EOCO,"Deputy ranking member of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament and Member of Parliament(MP) for Gushiegu, Lawyer Hassan Tampuli taken on the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) on allegations of human rights abuses. The private legal practitioner said that bail had been “weaponised” to suppress and oppress suspects, and called for a realignment procedure. He criticised the detention of individuals without evidence of misappropriation of funds and described the bail amounts demanded by EOCO as excessive, urging that they be reconsidered. Speaking on Joy FM’s news analysis programme Newsfile, he maintained “bail should not be weaponised to oppress and suppress the rights of suspects” Earlier this week, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Dr. Dominic Ayine defended the Economic and Organised Crime Office’s (EOCO) decision to impose high bail conditions in major corruption and financial crime cases, especially those involving appointees of the previous administration. Dr. Ayine was responding to questions from Habib Iddrisu, Member of Parliament for Tolon and First Deputy Minority Whip, who sought clarification on the recent bail terms set by EOCO and whether alternative arrangements could be considered. The exchange took place in Parliament on Tuesday, November 18. Explaining the legal basis for EOCO’s actions, Dr. Ayine noted that the office, like all law enforcement bodies, operates under Article 14(4) of the Constitution, which permits the arrest and release of suspects either unconditionally or on reasonable terms that ensure they appear before the court. Legal representation He rejected suggestions that the high bail conditions target former government officials, stressing that the requirements vary according to the nature of the alleged crime. “Bail depends on the crime and the gravity of the offense,” Dr. Ayine said. “The sums involved in these investigations are very large. Setting unreasonably low bail could allow suspects to evade trial without sufficient compensation for the potential financial loss to the state.” He pointed to cases involving alleged financial losses running into hundreds of millions of cedis, underscoring that bail conditions must correspond to the scale of the alleged offenses.

Impunity is killing this Country  Dr. Arthur Kennedy,"The discussions on JoyPrime’s Newsfile on Saturday, November 22, 2025, took a dramatic turn when physician and political activist Dr Arthur Kennedy delivered a critique of Ghana’s governance and justice systems. The programme, hosted by Lawyer Samson Lardy Anyenini on the topic “OSP in the Eye of the Storm, Why EOCO Abusing Human Rights?, Galamsey Tribunals to Deliver Swift Justice,” centred heavily on the Office of the Special Prosecutor’s planned arraignment of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta and others over a 78-count corruption charge. Dr. Kennedy expressed profound frustration at what he described as a longstanding culture of impunity in Ghana, arguing that many of the country’s most troubling incidents have been met with silence rather than accountability. He referenced the battering of women and the six deaths recorded at the El Wak Stadium, noting that law enforcement agencies should have imposed immediate sanctions. According to him, the police station connected to the assault cases should have been punished by now, insisting that the absence of consequences undermines public confidence in justice. Addressing concerns that the case against Ofori-Atta might already be a lost case due to his absence from the country, Dr. Kennedy stressed that the prosecution should proceed regardless. He maintained that a case does not collapse simply because an accused person is out of jurisdiction. Dr. Kennedy linked the present case to past controversies, including the SML deal and syndicated loan arrangements, arguing that these issues had been growing quietly for years before escalating. He insisted that Ghana must build a justice system where no individual is insulated from scrutiny, adding that the Attorney-General must demonstrate due diligence in handling matters of public accountability. The physician lamented what he described as a pattern of “serial party dictatorship,” where incumbent governments appear immune to investigations even when allegations of misappropriation emerge. He emphasised that Ofori-Atta reported to the President and that the Former President Nana Addo Dankwah Akuffo Addo can therefore answer for how such large-scale financial concerns could occur under his watch. The conversation later shifted to allegations of human rights abuses by EOCO. Dr. Kennedy argued that the exercise of discretion in granting bail must be systematic and fair, emphasising that poor detainees with no access to lawyers should not be forgotten in the debate. He stressed that reform must extend to the many vulnerable people languishing in jail without proper representation. On the issue of galamsey tribunals, Dr. Kennedy argued that the country risks misdiagnosing the root of the problem if it focuses solely on prosecution. He described illegal mining as a national security threat that requires decisive state-led action. According to him, the tribunals are “side issues” and cannot solve the crisis on their own. He insisted that the government and the army must first act swiftly to reclaim forests and lands before turning to the prosecution of offenders. Preventive measures, he argued, are essential if Ghana is to halt the ongoing environmental degradation. Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Gushegu MP condemns misuse of bail conditions,"New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament for Gushegu, Alhassan Sulemana Tampuli, has raised concerns about what he describes as the misuse of bail conditions in Ghana’s justice system, arguing that they are increasingly being applied in a punitive manner. Speaking on JoyNews’ Newsfile, Tampuli said the pattern of enforcing bail conditions suggests that the process is no longer serving its intended purpose. “It appears that bail is now more or less being weaponised, used as a weapon to oppress suspects or persons of interest with some very wondrous bail terms and conditions,” he stated. He contrasted this trend with the operations of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), noting that its approach has historically not involved custodial demands. “OSP, you will hardly find any instance where OSP will insist that somebody must be held in custody,” he said. Tampuli also questioned the consistency of custodial decisions over the years, especially under the previous government. “We were in this country for the eight years that NPP was in power. Can you mention one person who was held in custody because he couldn’t meet any bail conditions?” he asked. He further criticised situations where individuals remain in custody despite the absence of financial loss linked to their cases. “There are people who have been held in custody unrelated to any loss of money. Why are you still holding them in custody? What are you trying to recover from them?” he said. Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

From setbacks to success: Minority Leader Afenyo-Markin shares his political journey,"Minority Leader Osahen Alexander Afenyo-Markin opened up about the highs and lows of his political career during a heartfelt interview on Atumpan FM 107.3, offering encouragement to colleagues and party members facing setbacks. Reflecting on his journey, Afenyo-Markin shared, “Every successful journey begins with a dream that was once higher than the sky.” The NPP stalwart recounted the early days when opportunities were scarce and recognition seemed elusive. He recalled a time when positions were being distributed among colleagues and new committee members, yet he was overlooked. “Gabby Okyere Darko advised me to work hard and pray,” he revealed, highlighting the importance of perseverance and faith in the face of disappointment. The Minority Leader emphasised the value of supportive friendships during trying times. “Friends like Richard Sky comforted me with this quote: ‘In the fullness of time, all things will align,’” he said, stressing that setbacks are not permanent. Afenyo-Markin encouraged patience and resilience, reminding party members that “People thought that crushing me would create opportunities for themselves, but that is not the ways of God. There is a future for everyone. If you’re ignored for now, just wait patiently for your time.” Sharing a personal experience from 2005, he recalled standing for the position of Constituency Chairman, only to secure 17 votes out of 50. “We have all failed before, but we did not make the failure define our future. Instead, it served as a stepping stone to achieve greater heights,” he said. He urged his party to remain united, saying, “We should not give up and be too hard on ourselves. Whatever has happened is okay. We must come together as a party and work for the betterment of our NPP.” Afenyo-Markin’s story serves as a powerful reminder that perseverance, faith, and unity are essential in politics and in life.

"Afenyo-Markin defends Ken Ofori-Attas absence, says former Minister is undergoing treatment in the US","A heated exchange unfolded in Parliament on Friday, November 21, 2025, after Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga demanded clarity on the continued stay of former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta in the United States, despite facing criminal charges in Ghana. Mr. Ayariga pressed Deputy Majority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin for an explanation, questioning both the timing of the trip and the sudden change in Mr. Ofori-Atta’s choice of medical care. According to him, the circumstances suggested a deliberate delay. He argued that the former minister’s absence was becoming increasingly difficult to justify, especially given his history of receiving treatment locally. “Ken Ofori-Atta was sick when he was a Finance Minister; we all saw it, and he stayed in Ghana. “How come today, he has refused to return when he’s being sought after by the law enforcement agencies?” Mr. Ayariga asked, implying that the relocation of his treatment raised legitimate concerns. In response, Mr. Afenyo-Markin firmly dismissed the suggestion that the former minister was avoiding accountability. He insisted that Mr. Ofori-Atta’s condition and whereabouts had been openly communicated to the public. “Mr. Ofori-Atta has been bold to disclose his medical condition. “Let it be known that we all may go through health issues one way or the other. Don’t create the impression that he’s refused to return to Ghana,” Mr. Afenyo-Markin said, urging MPs not to politicise health matters. He further underscored that the former minister had not concealed the purpose of his stay abroad. “According to him, Ofori-Atta “has told the entire country that he is unwell and receiving treatment in the United States.” Mr. Afenyo-Markin insisted that accusations of evasion were unfounded, stressing that Mr. Ayariga must “cease creating the impression that Ofori-Atta has refused to return to Ghana to face accountability.”  Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

"Titles dont build nations, courage does  Afoko","Businessman Paul Afoko has reminded young Ghanaians that national impact is not measured by political titles or public positions, but by the courage to shape history rather than allow history to shape them. Delivering his lecture during the fifth Dialogue Public Lecture at the Ama Ata Aidoo Centre for Creative Writing at the African University of Communications and Business (AUCB) on November 21, 2025, Afoko stressed that every citizen, not just presidents, ministers or MPs, has the capacity to influence Ghana’s future. He cited teachers, journalists and ordinary citizens as examples of people who make meaningful contributions through intentional actions guided by integrity and compassion. Afoko went on to outline practical strategies for ethical leadership, urging the youth to develop an “informed voice” by reading widely and understanding national issues. Knowledge, he said, strengthens courage and enables responsible advocacy. The second strategy, he emphasised, is to separate partisanship from patriotism. “Your love for country must be greater than loyalty to any political party,” he said, warning that leaders who cannot make this distinction often weaponise fragility and use power to intimidate rather than inspire. He encouraged the youth to speak respectfully but boldly, describing it as a patriotic obligation rather than defiance. Afoko’s third point focused on credibility. Without consistency in one’s character and actions, he noted, no leader can earn public trust. He advised young people to use their voices responsibly, to build, not destroy; to critique to improve, not to insult. “If the thunder of your voice obscures the message, then the message is lost,” he cautioned. His fourth and fifth strategies urged the youth to confront their personal issues before taking on national challenges, and to guard their values against divisive politics such as tribalism, which, he said, shrinks national peace and weakens collective progress. He reminded the audience that opportunities, comfort, safety and peace may sometimes be the cost of speaking up, but silence ultimately harms the nation more. “Cowardice costs the soul of the nation,” he warned. “A nation that does not speak its truth slowly loses its soul.” Afoko encouraged the youth to see themselves as future scriptwriters of Ghana’s destiny, the next generation of political thinkers, leaders and opinion shapers. “Will you be courageous enough to lead the change?” he asked. “Courage opens the door for learning and unlearning, which is what builds nations.”  Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Democracy needs bold voices  Paul Afoko challenges Ghanaian youth,"Former New Patriotic Party (NPP) National Chairman Awentami Paul Afoko has urged young Ghanaians to embrace civic courage and take an active role in safeguarding the country’s democracy, stressing that “democracy cannot defend or sustain itself” without the bold voices of the youth. Speaking at the fifth edition of the Dialogue Public Lecture held at the Ama Ata Aidoo Centre for Creative Writing at the African University of Communications and Business (AUCB) on November 2025, the seasoned political figure said Ghana’s democratic ideals of freedom and justice depend largely on the willingness of the younger generation to speak up, challenge wrongdoing, and uphold integrity. The event, moderated by Sabina Sarsa of AUCB’s School of Research and Graduate Studies, was organised under the theme “Civic Courage: Speaking Up, Standing Up, and Making a National Impact.” The lecture forms part of an intentional effort by the university to create a safe platform where young Ghanaians can explore the real-life demands of public engagement. Afoko opened his presentation by paying tribute to the late Ama Ata Aidoo, describing her as an “outstanding woman who refused to conform to the subjugation of women and the limitations placed on Africans.” Her life, he said, embodies the conviction and bravery the current generation must adopt. Quoting Aidoo’s famous assertion that “true courage is not the absence of fear but the presence of conviction, conviction, not comfort,” the former NPP Chairman emphasised that speaking up does not require the absence of fear. Rather, it demands a deep sense of responsibility and moral clarity, even when the environment is unsupportive. “Our culture does not permit children or the youth to speak freely,” he acknowledged, “but that should never be an excuse to remain silent.” He challenged students and young citizens to resist cultural pressures that silence them, saying Ghana’s progress depends on conscientious citizens willing to question, criticise, and stand their ground when the nation’s values are threatened. Afoko’s address set the tone for a reflective and thought-provoking interaction with the audience, reinforcing the central message that civic courage is an essential daily practice, not a momentary act. The Dialogue Public Lecture series continues to position AUCB as a hub for nurturing bold thinkers dedicated to national development.

You cannot shift the goalpost when the numbers improve  KSM to Bawumia,"Kwaku Sintim-Misa has used his KSM show platform to highlight what he called inconsistent political messaging on Ghana’s recent economic improvements. He revisited a widely-quoted statement from Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia: “When the fundamentals are weak, the exchange rate will expose you.” According to KSM, the same logic must apply when the currency strengthens. “When the exchange rate improved to the limit… come back graciously and say this is an indication that the fundamentals are getting strong,” he said on the KSM show monitored by MyNewsGh. Instead, he criticised the former Vice President for attributing the recent gains to his own ideas. “Really?” KSM asked. “The very ideas that you said had no policy? All of a sudden you have shifted the position so you can take credit.” He described this as “shifting goalposts,” adding that such behaviour undermines constructive debate. “First your position was this. Now the exchange rate is solid… then suddenly it becomes ‘my idea’. Why?” KSM highlighted changes in inflation, interest rates and the cedi’s performance as evidence of broader improvement, quoting even NPP-leaning commentators who acknowledged progress. “At a point inflation was over 50%. Within 12 months it dropped significantly,” he said, playing video excerpts from political analyst Striker. He argued that recognition of progress should transcend party affiliation. “It doesn’t matter your tribe, religion or party,” he said. “If this country succeeds, it succeeds for all of us.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

"If you have nothing good to say, just keep quiet  KSM slams 2026 budget opposers","Kwaku Sintim-Misa (KSM) used his latest episode of the KSM Show to weigh in on the 2026 budget, urging politicians and party communicators to elevate national interest above political theatre. “This is a show where we tell it like it is and let the chips fall where they bloody hell may. We are ready to crush any jandam with the truth. We shall suffocate the jandam with the truth,” he said during the programme monitored by MyNewsGh. KSM argued that criticism of the budget has become driven by political emotion rather than substance. “Whether you like it or not, the budget is very good,” he said, noting that while minor issues can be debated, the fundamentals are “solid”. He criticised MPs who dismissed the budget without demonstrating understanding. Referring to one lawmaker who questioned the presence of the COVID levy, he responded: “What sense does this make? Do you know how much good it would have been to her if she had just shut up?” Addressing another MP’s description of the budget as “growthless, jobless and minimalist,” KSM described the remark as “rubbish” and “shameful,” adding that “It would have been much more respectable to have shut the hell up.” He argued that critics from the former administration lack moral authority after eight years in office. “You were given the chance,” he said. “All you left was nothing but theft, decay and rot.” KSM insisted that national development should not be undermined by partisan denial. “If you don’t have anything good to say, it’s better to shut up,” he said. “Only a fool will say nothing is happening.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

NPP Chairmanship Race: Afoko presents a redemptive qualityDr. Arthur Kennedy,"A leading member of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Dr Arthur Kennedy, has hailed the decision of Paul Afoko to contest for the chairmanship of the NPP. He sees the decision of Paul Afoko as excellent, indicating that there is an exciting redemptive quality. Arthur Kennedy was speaking on Accra-based TV3 when he made this known. Although he is not sure of his chances, he believes that the decision to contest after how he was booted out is welcoming. “Excellent idea,” he said, adding that “there is a redemptive quality to Paul Afoko’s running. He wasn’t treated well. It is always possible that he won’t do well, but I think there is an exciting redemptive quality.” Paul Afoko has declared that he will be contesting for the chairmanship of the NPP. Afoko, who was removed as the Chairman of the NPP ahead of the 2016 election, believes that he still has what it takes to build the NPP and ensure that the political party regain its glory days.

NPPs Election Committee Insist there will be no proxy voting in Presidential primaries,"The Election Committee of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) insists that there will not be voting by proxy in the 2026 flagbearership election. According to the Chairman of the Committee, Joe Osei Owusu, the committee has read petitions and positions expressed by party folks; however, they insist on their earlier position. Addressing the press on November 20, 2025, he explained that the decision was reached to protect the integrity of the election. Speaking to TV3, Arthur Kennedy, who is a leading member of the party, indicated that something could have been done to prevent the current decision. He explained that there is more time for further engagement, indicating that the decision could change. “I don’t know if debates make much of the contest. It is too early. A lot of things are far away. I haven’t gotten excited yet. Whoever is voted by the NPP will have a credibility problem because of the process,” he said.

I am not desperate for power  A Plus says vision is about impact,"Gomoa Central MP Kwame A Plus has used a personal reflection to distance himself from accusations of seeking political power for its own sake, insisting that his focus is on community transformation rather than personal ambition. “I enjoy life. I enjoy peace. I enjoy laughter,” he wrote in a Facebook statement sighted by MyNewsGh, adding that his philosophy aligns with what he called a “hedonist” approach. “Power for what? For who? To rule over people who are already struggling?” He said the loss of his brother deepened this perspective. “When I lost my brother Omane Boamah, that outlook became even stronger. Life is too short and too unpredictable to be desperate for power.” According to A Plus, his goal is to uplift households and restore dignity. “I want every household to know where the next meal is coming from. I want the tears of our mothers… to finally bear fruits they themselves will enjoy.” He dismissed those attempting to undermine him, saying their fears were misplaced. “If that threatens you, then be threatened. If that scares you, then be scared,” he wrote. The MP ended his message with confidence in his mission: “We will keep building. We will keep loving. We will keep lifting people up. And by the grace of God, Gomoa will rise — with or without your permission.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

Gertrude Torkornoo politicized her removal by employing NPP lawyersNana Yaa Jantuah,"Presidential Staffer, Nana Yaa Jantuah has accused the former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo of politicizing her removal. According to her, the former Chief Justice, who is a person expected to be neutral, only appointed New Patriotic Party (NPP) lawyers to defend her during the process. “She had an array of lawyers to depend on, but was she NPP for all she was doing? Was she NPP? Because for me, it didn’t make sense. I asked If she says she is not political, why are all her lawyers NPP?” she questioned. When told that the former Chief Justice had the right to choose who she wanted to represent her, Nana Yaa Jantuah retorted, “She had the opportunity to take lawyers out of the NPP, but she chose then, and that means that it is her fold.” She continued, “There are a lot of lawyers in Ghana who are not NPP She could have gone for Marrieta Brew or Ama Jantuah Bamfo; my sister is also good. She herself politicized the process. She never said the NPP should halt for her to fight her battle, but no, she enjoyed the charade.” Nana Yaa Jantuah urged the former Chief Justice to be satisfied and know that she is gone forever because no other ruling can reinstate her.

Ayekoo  Gomoa MP commends trade and free zones leadership,"Gomoa Central MP Kwame A Plus has publicly acknowledged key government officials he says are driving efforts to establish the Gomoa Central Special Economic Zone (GC-SEZ). In a detailed post on social media, he expressed gratitude to institutions that, in his words, “understand the urgency, the need to create jobs so our youth don’t die in queues at military recruitment centers.” He singled out three officials: Dr. Mary Ewusi, CEO of the Ghana Free Zones Authority; Mr. Apau Wiredu Lateef, Deputy CEO of the Authority; and Trade Minister Elizabeth Ofosu Agyare. “From the bottom of my heart: Ayekoo. Thank you,” the MP wrote in a post sighted by MyNewsGh. He argued that their support demonstrates a non-political commitment to industrialisation. “Those who understand that building factories is not politics but survival,” he emphasised. With the GC-SEZ positioned as a major job-creation project, A Plus suggested that collaboration between local leadership and national agencies is essential. “With God and the people on our side, we shall build,” he said. He further announced a planned milestone in the district’s development agenda, stating: “We shall begin construction of this beautiful entrance on the 1st of December!” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

A Plus accuses opponents of sabotaging GC-SEZ Project,"Gomoa Central MP Kwame A Plus has accused unnamed individuals of actively undermining the  the Gomoa Central Special Economic Zone (GC-SEZ) project. In a statement shared on Facebook, the MP said certain actors were working behind the scenes to derail progress. “Some people who have achieved nothing for years will feel threatened and humiliated, and they will fight you,” he stated in a post sighted by MyNewsGh. He argued that repeated attempts to frustrate the project were driven by fear and envy. “Envy has blinded them. Fear has confused them. They think if they frustrate the project, they can frustrate my destiny,” he wrote. A Plus maintained that the district and the country would eventually prevail despite opposition. “Let them talk. Let them plot. Let them gather. We will still rise,” he said, insisting that the GC-SEZ was crucial for jobs, industry growth and local development. He quoted the Speaker of Parliament’s earlier caution regarding the project: “Don’t kill this one,” adding that “as usual, they didn’t listen.” The MP reiterated that he would not engage detractors. “We will not snap. We will not fight like we did some years ago. We will not lose focus,” he wrote. He concluded that the GC-SEZ would continue as planned, saying; “You can kill a person, but you can never kill an idea.” Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.

OSP has failed us  Martin Kpebu on why Kissi Agyebeng should resign,"Martin Kpebu has called for the immediate resignation of Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng, citing a “failure of duty” and breach of public trust in handling the high-profile Ken Ofori-Atta case. Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express, Kpebu described a sequence of missed opportunities that, in his view, exposed systemic lapses. “He said he intercepted the letter, then he ran to the National Investigations Bureau (NIB), but he didn’t get help, then ran to National Security, but didn’t get help there either, and finally he ran to the Ghana Immigration Service and still didn’t get help,” he said. “Worst of all, it didn’t occur to the man who had done the ‘Ankwanuma’ press conference that he should blow the whistle. “You know how many people would have taken steps to the airport to prevent him from travelling?” Kpebu, who was part of the ORAL team at the time, emphasized that the team included security personnel such as Kofi Boakye who could have intervened if the information had been properly shared. He argued that the Special Prosecutor’s actions undermined accountability and called into question the office’s commitment to its mandate.

"Ken Ofori-Atta, others to be arraigned on Monday November 24","The Office of the Special Prosecutor has announced that it will arraign Ken Ofori-Atta and others charged in the SML scandal in court on Monday November 24. In a statement shared via social media, the OSP said “The Prosecution will seek the necessary court orders for service of the charge sheet on the fugitives who are outside of the jurisdiction”. The OSP announced early this week that it had filed criminal charges against persons involved in the SML scandal. The Offic provided a breakdown of the matter “ The Republic V Kenneth Ofori-Atta and 7 others All you need to know; Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1) was the Minister of Finance at all material times in relation to him. Ernest Darko Akore (A2) was the Chef de Cabinet of Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1) in his capacity as the Minister of Finance at all material times in relation to him. Emmanuel Kofi Nti (A3) was the Commissioner-General of Ghana Revenue Authority at all material times in relation to him. Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah (A4) was the Commissioner-General of Ghana Revenue Authority at all material times in relation to him. Isaac Crentsil (A5) was the Commissioner of the Customs Division of Ghana Revenue Authority at all material times in relation to him. Kwadwo Damoah (A6) was the Commissioner of the Customs Division of Ghana Revenue Authority at all material times in relation to him. Evans Adusei (A7) is the Chief Executive, beneficial owner, and controlling mind of SML (A8). SML (A8) is a company registered in Ghana (formerly known as Strategic Mobilisation Enhancement Limited). The Accused Persons conspired to set up and did perform acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to set up a criminal enterprise of directly and indirectly influencing the procurement process to obtain unfair advantage for SML (A8) in the award of procurement contracts for transaction audit services, external price verification services, measurement audit of downstream petroleum products, upstream petroleum audit services, and minerals audit services purportedly by the Government of Ghana, acting through the Ministry of Finance and Ghana Revenue Authority. The criminal enterprise was commenced in 2017 by Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1), Emmanuel Kofi Nti (A3), Evans Adusei (A7), and SML (A8), with the other Accused Persons joining the adventure at various times. The criminal enterprise was characterised by no genuine need for contracting SML (A8) for the obligations it purported to perform, and the contracts were secured for SML (A8) through self-serving patronage, sponsorship, and promotion by the Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1), Ernest Darko Akore (A2), Emmanuel Kofi Nti (A3), Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah (A4), Isaac Crentsil (A5), and Kwadwo Damoah (A6) based on false and unverified claims. Also, the contracts were attended by the commission of egregious prohibited acts as mandatory statutory prior approvals by Parliament, and the Procurement Authority were wantonly disregarded by Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1), Emmanuel Kofi Nti (A3), Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah (A4), Isaac Crentsil (A5), and Kwadwo Damoah (A6) who acted with increased emboldened impunity as they freely abused their public offices by using the offices for private benefit. Further, Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1), Emmanuel Kofi Nti (A3), Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah (A4), Isaac Crentsil (A5), and Kwadwo Damoah (A6) ensured that there was no established financial management system of monitoring and verification to assure that the Republic was obtaining the value for the money it was paying to SML (, and the channels of payments of public funds to SML ( were set on automatic mode by Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1), Emmanuel Kofi Nti (A3), Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah (A4), Isaac Crentsil (A5), and Kwadwo Damoah (A6) detached from actual performance and based on false and unverified claims in wilful oppressive injury to the public. The actions of Kenneth Ofori-Atta (A1), Emmanuel Kofi Nti (A3), Ammishaddai Owusu-Amoah (A4), Isaac Crentsil (A5), and Kwadwo Damoah (A6) created the opportunity for SML (A8) to largely pretend to perform the services under the various contracts – leading to immense financial loss to the Republic of about One Billion Four Hundred and Thirty-Six Million Two Hundred and Forty-Nine Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty-Eight Cedis Fifty-Three Pesewas (GHC1,436,249,828.53). And had they not been halted by the actions of three petitioners who lodged a complaint with the Office of the Special Prosecutor in December 2023 against the criminal enterprise; corruption and corruption-related investigations conducted by the Office of the Special Prosecutor between 20 December 2023 and 3 October 2025; Government intervention of temporarily suspending performance of the purported services in early January 2024; and a directive by the President of the Republic on 31 October 2025 for the termination of all the public contracts awarded to SML (A8) by the Ministry of Finance and Ghana Revenue Authority – the Accused Persons also intended that a further estimated Two Billion Seven Hundred and Ninety-Nine Million Six Hundred and Four Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty-Four United States Dollars Seventy-One Cents (US$2,799,604,864.71) be paid to SML (A8) for a period of five(5) years without the mandatory statutory prior authorisation by Parliament. The Accused Persons based their actions on their false claims that SML (A8) possessed technical expertise and capability in revenue assurance, and that the technical expertise and capability of SML (A8) had greatly increased revenue for the Republic; and further that SML (A8) exclusively possessed the only patented and proven technology systems in the world for value chain transaction audits, external price verification, and measurement audit services in the downstream petroleum, upstream petroleum, and minerals sectors. Based on the above, the Accused Persons have been charged before the Criminal Division of the High Court.

We will get him  Martin Kpebu pushes for Ofori-Atta extradition,"A private legal practitioner, Martin Kpebu, is urging the government to intensify efforts to extradite former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta, insisting that the delays are jeopardising the state’s ability to recover assets linked to alleged financial losses. Kpebu noted that although earlier attempts did not yield results, the state must not relent. “When you fall, you rise again, we have to attempt it again,” he said, adding that the Attorney-General is currently working on the extradition process. He argued that public perception may suggest Ofori-Atta has evaded accountability, but insisted the situation will change. “It may seem Ken Ofori-Atta has won and is free now, but with time, we will get him. We have lost a lot of time trying to apprehend him,” he staed on Joy News’ PM Express. Kpebu warned that prolonged delays could undermine the state’s ability to reclaim assets for national development. “If we delay, by the time he is arrested, he may have sold his assets, and there will be nothing left to recover to compensate for the losses he has caused,” he said. Emphasising the importance of asset recovery, he added: “We need the properties, that is what counts. We need to build hospitals and create jobs for the unemployed youth, and to do that, we need the money.” He criticised the state’s failure so far to secure the assets in question. “What has been done to freeze his assets? Nothing! Ofori-Atta is not returning to the country any time soon,” Kpebu asserted. Source: MyNewsGh.com Thanks for reading from MyNewsGH as a news publishing website from Ghana.
