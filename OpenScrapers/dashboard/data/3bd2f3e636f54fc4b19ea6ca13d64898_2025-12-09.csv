"Ghanas public debate too emotional, not driven by data  Prof Bokpin","Economics professor Godfred Bokpin has criticised the quality of Ghana’s national conversations, arguing that far too many public debates are shaped by emotion rather than evidence. He says the country must urgently elevate the role of data in public policy, decision-making and everyday discourse.




Speaking at the 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users and Enhancers, Prof. Bokpin stressed that reliable data remains the single most important input for sound governance and economic management. According to him, countries can function without natural resources, but no nation can progress without solid data.


“As an academic, I value data more than gold or oil. Without data, nothing gets done. That is how important it is,” he told participants during a panel discussion.


He also noted that although the Ghana Statistical Service produces a wealth of information every year, much of it is ignored or underutilised. He urged policymakers, businesses and the public to integrate this data into planning, monitoring and evaluation processes.


“There is so much data harvested by the Statistical Service, yet many people think they only produce GDP figures,” he said. “The real question is: how often do we rely on data in our daily lives? How data-driven are we?”




Prof. Bokpin lamented that national discussions frequently resemble talk shows rather than evidence-based exchanges. He argued that greater reliance on data would reduce disputes on media platforms and temper emotionally charged debates.


“If we were driven by data as a country, there would be fewer disagreements, less emotion and probably fewer fights, because data simply speaks for itself,” he added.

Arthur Kennedy writes on President Kufuor,"Four score and 7 years ago, a child was born. He has been very consequential to Ghana, Africa and the world.




I read biographies a lot so even though I had interacted with President Kufuor quite a bit, I looked for a biography. From that, I learned that he had been an exceptional student at Prempeh College, where according to his biography, he picked up virtually every prize in sight.


After returning to Ghana after his education in UK, he joined politics at a young age. He served under Busia and Rawlings but his masterpiece, on the way to the Presidency, was his 1996 campaign, repeated in 1998.


He was under-resourced but he made up for his lack of resources with hard work and personal relations.


Indeed, it was Northerners who propelled him to victory in his primary campaigns. In 2007, during my ill-fated campaign, in home after home in the north, they showed me the beds or cots he slept on and recounted stories of midnight knocks on doors by Kufuor.




As President, he was humble and inclusive. A humble Ashanti! As he once said, ""Every party has factions and leaders must accommodate them"".


Wherever he went as President, doors opened, to him and for Ghana. And he strengthened institutions with good quality appointments. But his finest season may have been in his post-presidency.


He has been dignified, statesmanlike-- maybe a tad too quiet, formed a foundation and helped to establish APIMI. As he explained last September at a forum, public interest digital media combined with AI will bring Africa to the centre of global development.


Together with President Mahama, the Oldman will help give us and the youth the tools to keep Ghana as the gateway to Africa through this century.



Mr President, as they sing ""Di wo hene"" and you twirl around a bit, remember our last conversation and speak out more. And if Delay proposes, turn her down!


May God bless you with many more years of joy and health. Happy birthday!

IMANI files RTI request seeking details on new nationwide SIM registration,"Policy think tank IMANI Africa has filed a Right to Information (RTI) request seeking full disclosure on the government’s planned nationwide SIM registration exercise set to begin in early 2026. The group says the move is necessary to ensure transparency, legality, and data protection ahead of the rollout.




In a request submitted on Monday, December 8, 2025, to the Ministry of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, IMANI asked for documents covering the legal basis of the new registration regime, technical design, biometric verification systems, procurement records, and oversight arrangements. The request was received by the Minister’s secretary, the think tank confirmed.


IMANI said Ghanaians deserve clarity on how their biometric data will be collected, stored, and protected under the new system. It also raised concerns about governance, cost implications, and the role of private sector vendors expected to participate in the exercise.


The think tank cited Article 21(1)(f) of the 1992 Constitution and the Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), which guarantees public access to information held by state institutions. It said its request aligns with efforts “to promote accountability and ensure that the exercise is conducted in the public interest.”


IMANI’s submission asked the ministry to disclose the legal instruments authorising the new SIM registry, the architecture of the verification process, details of vendors selected, and any agreements governing the management of citizens’ data.




According to IMANI, the RTI application is a proactive step to safeguard transparency and protect user rights before the exercise begins. The think tank added that public trust depends on clear assurances that data-sharing protocols and privacy safeguards meet national and international standards.

High Court ruling on Kpandai will stand unless overturned by Supreme Court- Berekum West MP,"The Member of Parliament for Berekum West, Dickson Kyere-Duah, says the decision by Parliament to notify the Electoral Commission (EC) of a vacancy in the Kpandai Constituency is simply a constitutional requirement and will remain in force unless a higher court reverses the ruling.




Speaking on the AM Show, he explained that the High Court’s decision ordering a re-run of the 2024 parliamentary election in Kpandai must be respected by all parties, including Parliament and the EC.


“This does not stop my brother Matthew Nyindam from pursuing his case at the Supreme Court,” he said. “If the verdict of the High Court is overturned at any point, it will stop the EC from proceeding to conduct the election. So for me, nothing new has happened.”


Kyere-Duah stressed that Parliament was only communicating the court’s directive to the EC, as mandated by law. He noted that if the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal delivers a contrary ruling, Parliament will similarly implement it without hesitation.


“A court decision will be respected by everybody,” he said, adding that “in the same vein, if an appeal court overturns the decision, the same will be implemented by Parliament.”




His comments come after the Parliamentary Service formally informed the EC of a vacancy in the Kpandai seat. 


The notification, dated 4 December 2025 and signed by the Clerk to Parliament, Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror, signals the official start of processes to conduct a re-run election.


The letter was issued in line with Article 112(5) of the 1992 Constitution, which requires the Clerk to Parliament to notify the EC whenever a parliamentary seat becomes vacant.


The re-run is expected to determine who ultimately represents the people of Kpandai in Parliament, following the annulment of the 2024 parliamentary election results in that constituency

"Tariff hikes a sign of failed leadership, suspend it  Minority to govt","The parliamentary Minority has condemned the recent utility tariff increases, calling them a symptom of failed leadership and poor leadership choices. 




The demand for suspension was made at a press conference addressed by the Ranking Member of Parliament’s Energy Committee, George Kwame Aboagye.


At the briefing, Aboagye criticized the decision by PURC to raise electricity and water tariffs, arguing the hike lacked justification. He said the increase reflects deeper problems in governance and management of the utility sector rather than any real improvement in service delivery.


""Our position remains firm and non-negotiable. This tariff must be reversed immediately, and measures must be taken to protect consumers and sustain businesses. Ghanaian deserves relief, not repeated shots,"" he said.


PURC concluded its 2026–2030 Multi-Year Tariff Review (MYTO) and announced new utility rates to take effect on 1 January 2026. 




Under the new order, electricity tariffs will rise by 9.86 percent across all customer categories, and water tariffs will increase by 15.92 percent for all consumers.


The Commission said the increases reflect the investment needs of water and electricity utilities over the next five years, covering both capital expenditure and operational costs, under prevailing macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, exchange rate fluctuations, and rising fuel costs.


PURC added that the review followed a series of investment hearings, stakeholder consultations, and regional public forums across the country. 


The Commission also introduced a mini-grid tariff scheme under the MYTO, bringing the costs of supplying electricity to island and remote communities into the national tariff framework under the purview of the Volta River Authority (VRA).



During the press conference, the Minority argued that customers should not be made to pay more while chronic inefficiencies persist at utilities such as the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) and the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL). 


They described the tariff increases as unjustifiable and maintained that the hike shifts the burden to consumers.


""The minority stands firmly with Ghanaian workers, households, small businesses and industries struggling to survive. We will continue to use every legitimate parliamentary tool to demand fairness, transparency and accountability in the management of the nation's utilities.""

Kufuor spoke the obvious truth  NPP defends critique of Akufo-Addo administration,"The New Patriotic Party (NPP) has defended former President John Agyekum Kufuor’s recent critique of the Akufo-Addo administration, insisting that his comments merely reflected the undeniable realities that shaped Ghana’s economic direction ahead of the 2024 elections.




Former President Kufuor, speaking on The Delay Show, highlighted several key policy decisions including the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), the National Cathedral project, and the controversial Power Distribution Services (PDS) deal, as major factors that contributed to the party’s electoral defeat.





Reacting to these remarks, the NPP’s Deputy General Secretary, Haruna Mohammed, said the former president’s observations should be viewed in the context of admissions already made by former President Akufo-Addo regarding the weight and consequences of those decisions.


“Former President Kufuor spoke the obvious. What he said is not different from the facts. Even President Akufo-Addo himself has said that the DDEP was a very difficult decision for him,” he said. 


“If you listen to Kufuor, he says the Akufo-Addo government was doing very well until COVID came. After COVID, things were never the same, and policies had to be implemented to keep Ghana’s economy strong. What he [Kufuor] said is obvious, and the party fully agrees with it,” he added.




Mr Mohammed emphasised that although the measures—particularly the DDEP—were painful, they were crucial to stabilising the economy at a critical point. 


He insisted that the current economic recovery under the Mahama administration is, in large part, a result of the groundwork laid by the Akufo-Addo government.


“DDEP was a difficult decision, but today this government is enjoying the programme as it came with so many positives. We were given debt reliefs, cancellations, and extensions and today Ghana's economy is stronger.


“The Finance Minister admitted that some of the debt programmes were very good for the economy, and they are enjoying the fruits.”

NDC party hawks instigating removal of key officials of independent institutions  Afenyo-Markin,"Minority Leader and MP for Effutu, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, has accused powerful figures within the National Democratic Congress (NDC) of pushing an agenda to remove key public office holders under the guise of government restructuring.




In a letter to President John Dramani Mahama titled “One Year After: Ghana’s Democracy at a Crossroads,” the Minority Leader reflected on developments since the December 7, 2024, general elections, which returned the NDC to power.


Mr Afenyo-Markin said the pattern of dismissals witnessed over the past year raises serious concerns about the direction of governance. According to him, the actions of the administration show a shift from national renewal to political retribution.


“First came the purge; thousands of citizens, working lawfully within state institutions and parastatals, were sent home without just cause or due process. Then came the unprecedented removal of the Chief Justice. Now, the top echelons of the Electoral Commission and the Office of the Special Prosecutor face the same fate.”

He said that these developments point to a coordinated agenda driven not by the Presidency but by entrenched forces within the governing party.




“A pattern emerges, clear as daylight. Party hawks are the ones apparently driving the agenda,” the Minority Leader stated.





Afenyo-Markin added that the ongoing wave of removals does not align with the government’s stated commitment to national resetting and institutional strengthening.


“This is not RESET; it is retribution. This is not legacy-building; it is vendetta politics dressed in the language of renewal.”


He warned that a government focused on targeting individuals instead of addressing national challenges fails the very people who entrusted it with power.



“When a government spends its energy removing people rather than creating opportunities, when it focuses on settling scores rather than solving problems, it reveals its true priorities, and those priorities have nothing to do with the welfare of ordinary Ghanaians,” the letter read.

White South Africans divided on US refugee offer,"The 4m-high (13ft) electric steel gates, capped with spikes, creak open as Marthinus, a farmer, drives through in his pick-up truck. Cameras positioned at the entrance track his every move, while reams of barbed wire surround the farm in the rural Free State province in the heart of South Africa.




""It feels like a prison,"" he says as the gates clank shut behind him. ""If they want to come and kill us they can. At least it will take them time to get to me.""


The fear of being attacked is very real for the white Afrikaner, who manages a farm with his wife and two young daughters. He did not want us to use his full name.


His grandfather and his wife's grandfather were both murdered in farm attacks, and he lives a two-hour drive from where the body of 21-year-old farm manager Brendan Horner was discovered five years ago, tied to a pole, with a rope around his neck.


Marthinus says he can't take a chance with his own family and, in February, they applied for refugee status in the US.




""I'm prepared to do that to get a better life for my wife and children. Because I don't want to be slaughtered and be hanged on a pole,"" he says.


""Our Afrikaner people are an endangered species.""


Not all white South Africans agree that they're being targeted and black farmers are also victims of the country's high crime rate.


Marthinus will be leaving his farm behind if he moves to the US


It's estimated that thousands of Afrikaners - who are mostly white descendants of early European settlers - have begun the lengthy process of applying for refugee status in the US since President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year, although the figures haven't been made public.



Despite announcing in October that the US would reduce its yearly intake of refugees from 125,000 to 7,500, Trump has made the resettlement of Afrikaners a priority.


A presidential document posted to the official daily journal of the US government stated that those accepted would ""primarily"" be Afrikaner South Africans and ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands"".


For Marthinus it's a way out.


""I will give my whole life just so that my wife and my kids can be safe. Living in fear, you know? Nobody deserves a life like that.""




Violent crime in South Africa is endemic.


The latest crime figures released in November for the first quarter of 2025 show there was an average of 63 murders every day. While this was a decrease on the same period in 2024, South Africa's homicide rate remains one of the highest in the world.


Farmer Thabo Makopo is also worried about being targeted by criminals


Black farmers are also victims.


On the outskirts of Ficksburg, a town at the foot of Free State's Imperani Mountain, Thabo Makopo has a small farm of 237 acres (96 hectares), where he tends sheep and cattle. Like Marthinus, the 45-year-old says farm attacks are his biggest problem.




""They are young men. They are armed and dangerous. Whether they will lose their life or take yours, they are going to take those livestock,"" he says.


Thabo believes all farmers in the province, regardless of their race, are at risk of attack.


""It's all of us. I could be attacked today - it could happen to any of us.""


Police response rates to reports of crime are notoriously low, something the police here acknowledge but have said publicly that they are working on.




In the meantime, South Africans are becoming increasingly dependent on private security. According to the official regulatory body for the private security sector in South Africa, there are more than 630,000 active security guards. That is more than the police and army combined.


Morgan Barrett rejects the idea that there is a white genocide


Many farmers, like Morgan Barrett, who is white, employ their own security guards, if they can afford it. He owns a 2,000-acre farm which has been in his family for six generations.


Wrapped up in a thick jacket and hat, he climbs into his car to begin a night patrol. Between Morgan and his neighbours, they are out almost every night. Six of his cattle were stolen the previous week.


""You can call the police, and they may turn up two or three hours later, by which time the thieves will have run away,"" he says.




Like Thabo, he doesn't believe he is targeted because of the colour of his skin.


""I don't buy that narrative that in this area the attacks are against whites only.""


""If they thought that the black guy had 20,000 rand ($1,200; £880) sitting in his safe, they'd attack him just as quickly as they'd attack the white guy with 20,000 [rand] in the safe.""


Asked about what he thinks of people claiming there is a ""white genocide"" in South Africa, he says he thinks they ""have no real understanding of what a genocide is"".




""What happened in Rwanda is genocide. What is happening to white farmers is very bad, but I don't think you can call it genocide.""


Trump has repeated the widely disputed claims there is a genocide against white farmers, while South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, has accused South African politicians of ""actively promoting"" a genocide.


The government here has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other white South Africans are being persecuted.


The country does not release crime figures based on race, but in May, in order to debunk these claims, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu gave a breakdown of killings on farms.


Mchunu said that between October 2024 and March 2025, there were 18 farm murders across South Africa. Sixteen of the victims were black, while two were white.


Despite these statistics, the theory that white people are being persecuted for their race, once an idea confined to far-right groups in South Africa, continues to be propelled into the mainstream.


Systematic racial persecution is something black people in South Africa, who make up more than 80% of the population, have faced for decades.


Under the apartheid system that lasted for 46 years from 1948, the white-minority government legally separated people based on the colour of their skin.


It was built on already existing discriminatory legislation.


The right to vote, buy land and work in skilled jobs was reserved for white people. Millions of black South Africans were removed from their land and forced to live in segregated neighbourhoods where education in schools was restricted to maintain racial hierarchy.


The regime was enforced through violence and repression.


Even though apartheid ended in 1994, the profound racial inequalities continue to exist more than 30 years later.


The post-apartheid government did introduce affirmative action policies to try and redress some of the issues, but these have been criticised by some for not being effective and introducing ""race quotas"".


Nevertheless, 72% of private farmland is still in white hands, according to the government's 2017 Land Audit report. That's despite white people making up just 7.3% of the population.


A land reform programme - based on the principle of willing-seller, willing-buyer - has hardly moved the dial. A new law this year does give the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners, but this is only in rare circumstances, according to legal experts who spoke to the BBC.


And while white farmers own more private land than any other group in the country, victims of farm attacks span across all races.


The political spotlight is on white farmers, yet crime and violence on the ground is indiscriminate.


Nthabiseng Nthathakana's husband died when criminals attacked their small shop


In Meqheleng, a township on the outskirts of Ficksburg where black South Africans were forcibly relocated during the apartheid regime, Nthabiseng Nthathakana owns a small general store.


On 15 January this year, there was a robbery while her husband, Thembani Ncgango, was closing up. He managed to run to a neighbour's house but his attackers threatened to kill them if they opened the door.


Nthabiseng found Thembani's body on the ground outside.


""He had bullets everywhere and stab wounds. They had stabbed him and hit him with rocks,"" she says.


No one has been arrested for his murder.


Nthabiseng is now the sole provider for her four children.


""The kids ask questions: 'Mama, who killed Dad?' And you don't know what to say,"" she says.


Two hours' drive from Ficksburg, Marthinus and his family have just found out their refugee application to the US has been successful.


They're busy planning the big move, waiting to hear when their flights will be allocated.


He maintains that white people are being persecuted in South Africa.


""A lot of people believe that it's a political thing to get rid of us as white farmers or white people in this country, so they can have this land for themselves and this place for themselves.


""I'm really grateful to be getting away from this feeling of fear. I'm thankful to almighty God for answering our prayers.""

"Burkina Faso plans to restore death penalty for treason, terrorism, espionage","Burkina Faso’s Council of Ministers has adopted a bill to restore the death penalty, targeting offences such as treason, terrorism and espionage, authorities said.




“The adoption of this bill is part of reforms ... to have a justice that responds to the deep aspirations of our people,” Minister of Justice Edasso Rodrigue Bayala said in a Facebook post late Thursday.


The death penalty was abolished in the country in 2018.


The bill has to be adopted by parliament and reviewed by the courts before becoming law.


Marceau Sivieude, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, called the move a “serious setback for human rights in Burkina Faso,” and alarming “in the context of the ongoing crackdown on political opponents, human rights activists and journalists in Burkina Faso.”




Since taking power in a 2022 coup, the West African country’s military leaders have launched sweeping reforms, including postponing elections that were expected to restore civilian rule and dissolving the country’s independent electoral commission.


Burkina Faso has increasingly silenced critical media outlets in recent years. It suspended the BBC and Voice of America radio stations for their coverage of a mass killing of civilians carried out by the country’s armed forces, as well as arrested three prominent journalists earlier this year.


The country is one of several West African nations where the military has taken over in recent years, capitalising on widespread discontent with previous democratically elected governments over security issues. The military government has been accused of human rights abuses and the detention of journalists critical of the government.


The landlocked nation of 23 million people is among the countries struggling with a security crisis in the arid Sahel region south of the Sahara in recent years. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.

Ivory Coasts incumbent leader Ouattara is sworn in for a fourth term,"Ivory Coast’s incumbent President Alassane Ouattara was sworn in on Monday for a fourth term after taking over 89% of the vote in an October election marked by low turnout and unrest.




“This vote is a choice for stability, peace, and development,” Ouattara said, after his government excluded main opposition figures from the election. 


Violence around the vote killed at least 11 people, and over 1,650 people were arrested, according to official figures.


“We are not in the business of telling people how to run their country,” Jacob Helberg, U.S. assistant secretary of state for economic affairs, told The Associated Press a day before the inauguration, adding that “ultimately, we think the Ivory Coast is a politically stable place that is growing quickly.”


Eleven African presidents also attended Monday’s ceremony in the West African nation.




Ouattara first came to power after winning a disputed election in 2010 against his predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo. 


Ouattara oversaw a referendum that changed the constitution in 2016, and in 2020 he said the amended constitution reset his time in office to zero, which his opponents rejected.


Supporters have credited Ouattara with restoring the economy in the world’s largest cocoa producer, while critics have accused him of tightening his grip on power.

Benin govt says short-lived coup left casualties on both sides,"The short-lived coup in Benin left “casualties on both sides” of the government forces and the mutinous soldiers, authorities said Monday, as security forces intensified the search for the coup leader who was on the run.




The military takeover attempting to overthrow President Patrice Talon, which lasted a few hours before authorities announced it had been foiled, was the latest in a series of recent coups across Africa — most following a similar pattern of disputed elections, constitutional upheaval, security crises and youth discontent.


In a statement detailing Sunday’s events, Government Secretary Edouard Ouin-Ouro said the mutinous soldiers attacked Talon around 5 a.m. before being “overwhelmed by the fierce resistance of the loyal soldiers.”


The government confirmed the involvement of Nigerian and Ivorian troops in helping to thwart the coup, saying the Nigerian military had “(used) its military aircraft, which immobilised some of the armoured vehicles.”


Authorities said that although several arrests have been made over the coup, its apparent leader remained on the run and was being hunted. Two senior military officers held hostage by those carrying out the coup had also been released, officials said. Authorities did not specify the number of casualties.




An ongoing investigation into the coup will “identify all the perpetrators and their sponsors, whoever they may be” and will assess the damage in the aftermath, Ouin-Ouro said in the statement issued after a high-level cabinet meeting chaired by the Benin leader.


How the coup unfolded


A group of soldiers calling themselves the Committee for Refoundation stormed the national television station on Sunday morning to announce the coup.


Led by Lt. Col. Pascal Tigri, eight soldiers appeared in a broadcast announcing the removal of Talon, the dissolution of the government and the suspension of state institutions.


Before the coup, Tigri was a member of Talon’s protection detail. As an artillery officer, he commanded a National Guard battalion between 2023 and 2025.



By Sunday afternoon, the coup was foiled by Benin’s military, supported by Nigerian air and ground forces, which launched attacks against fleeing coup participants.


Calm on Monday returned to Cotonou, Benin’s administrative centre, with soldiers on the streets.


Talon described the coup late Sunday as a “senseless adventure,” and said the situation was under control. He vowed to punish mutineers and ensure the safety of hostages, including some believed to be senior military officers. He didn’t disclose their identities, and it wasn’t clear how many were held.


The Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, said Sunday that it had deployed a standby force to Benin to help preserve democracy. The troops included personnel from Nigeria, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone. The size of the force was unclear.




A Nigerian government spokesperson said in a statement that Talon had requested Nigeria’s help. It wasn’t clear how many personnel or how much equipment had been deployed.


Regional challenge


Nigeria and the ECOWAS regional bloc hadn’t intervened in a member state since 2017, when it sent troops to Gambia to force then-President Yahya Jammeh to vacate power following his election loss.


The bloc, led by Nigeria, tried to intervene in Niger after the country’s 2023 coup. At that time, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu led the bloc. His threat to intervene if the junta didn’t restore the ousted democratic government resulted in a standoff between the bloc and three junta-led countries, and they later left the bloc.


Analysts say Nigeria has a strategic interest in defending its borders — which it shares with Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon — especially now, while it experiences a severe security crisis.




“The coup in Benin is one too many. Nigeria cannot afford to be encircled by hostile governments,” Oluwole Ojewale, a senior security researcher at Dakar-based Institute for Security Studies, told The Associated Press.


As West Africa battles a surge in coups, analysts say ECOWAS lacks consistency in its response. In Gabon and Guinea-Bissau, the bloc was less assertive, and it has watched some other leaders stay in office via constitutional changes.


“You can make the argument that Tinubu needed to show some strength in preserving democracy, but this now speaks to ECOWAS’ double standard,” said Cheta Nwanze, a partner at the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence geopolitical consultancy firm.


Despite a history of coups following its independence from France in 1960, Benin has enjoyed relative calm in the past two decades. The country is set to elect a new president in April, because Talon is set to leave office after a decade in power.

19-year-old remanded on three charges,"A 19-year-old unemployed person has been remanded into prison custody on three charges by the Asante Abuakwa circuit court in the Atwima Nwabiagya South Municipality. 




Aaron Attah pleaded guilty to the charges of unlawful entry, attempted stealing and causing harm. 


He will reappear before the court presided over by Ms Rosemond Dodua Agyiri on December 18, this year. 


Presenting the facts of the case to the court, Police Detective Inspector Alexander Agbekpornu, said the complainant, Owusu Boakye Yiadom, was a Disc Jockey, residing in Nketia, while the convict resided at Adankwame near Abuakwa. 


He said, on December 02, this year, at about 11 hours, the complainant was on his way to work and upon reaching his mother’s house, heard some unusual noise in the house. 




The complainant became suspicious, went closer, checked, and saw Attah trying to open the door to the main room, so he stood outside waiting and watching. 


The complainant then saw the convict, who descended from the ceiling, trying to escape, so he rushed in to arrest him, but Attah stabbed his right shoulder and stomach with a knife, and he bled profusely. 


After that, the convict took to his heels but was chased, and with the help of some neighbours, he was arrested and handed over to the Asuofua police. 


The complainant was rushed to the Suntreso government hospital, but he was transferred to the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), where he was still on admission, receiving treatment. 



Prosecution said, in a caution statement, the convict admitted the offences. 


After further investigations, he was charged and brought before the court.

Police arrest 3 suspected kidnappers after fierce gun battle,"The Northern Regional Police Command has successfully arrested three suspected kidnappers during an intelligence-led operation conducted on Saturday, December 6, in Bokpaba, a community located along the Bimbilla–Yendi stretch of the Eastern Corridor.




The suspects Haruna Seidu, Amidu Bandi, and Osman Bandi are believed to be members of a four-man kidnapping syndicate responsible for abducting a 42-year-old man from Wapuli in the Yendi District. 


According to police reports, the suspects demanded a GH¢100,000 ransom from the victim’s family as a precondition for his release.


In a statement issued on Monday, December 8, the police noted that upon receiving information about the kidnapping, the Regional Police Intelligence Directorate (RPID) swiftly deployed a five-member team to Wapuli. 





The officers were tasked with conducting surveillance, rescuing the victim, and apprehending the suspects.




On Friday, December 5, the operation culminated in a dramatic confrontation during which police engaged the suspects in an intensive exchange of gunfire.


 Despite the danger, the officers managed to rescue the victim safely and arrest three members of the syndicate.


The fourth suspect, whose identity remains withheld by Police, fled the scene during the gunfire exchange and is believed to have sustained gunshot wounds. 





The Northern Regional Police Command urged residents in communities around Wapuli, Bimbilla, and Yendi to report any suspicious individuals or provide information that may lead to the fugitive’s arrest.



The arrested suspects are currently in police custody and are expected to be arraigned before court in the coming days as investigations continue.


""The suspects are currently in Police custody and will be arraigned before court.""


The Northern Regional Police Command reaffirmed its commitment to combating violent crime and enhancing public safety.


""Meanwhile, the fourth suspect is believed to have sustained gunshot wounds and Police is urging the public to assist with relevant information that would lead to his arrest,"" the statement read.

Bono Region Police cracks down on robbery gangs in intelligence-led operation,"The Bono Regional Police Command has recorded a major breakthrough in its sustained fight against armed robbery and organised crime, following the arrest and prosecution of several suspects believed to be behind a string of violent attacks across the region.




Speaking to the media at the press conference in Sunyani at the police regional headquarters, the Bono Regional Police Commander, DCOP Joshua Coppson said the arrests were made through coordinated intelligence-led operations carried out in Berekum, Drobo, Nkaseim, Domfete, Ewiakrom, and surrounding communities.





The operations targeted criminal networks responsible for robbery attacks, firearm trafficking, and the movement of stolen motorcycles to neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire.


The suspects arrested include Johnson Amponsah Kwame Diawuo, 47; Shadrach Owusu (alias Shark), 25; Kwafo Samuel, 30; Latif Mustapha (alias Star Boy), 28; Mosby Owusu, 20; Kofi Iddrisa, 45; Kwabena Agon Azubilla Akalotey, 18; and Baba Kumi Foster, 35.


He highlighted that the Police investigations established that on 18th November 2025, a five-member gang led by Johnson Amponsah attempted to rob travellers on the Berekum–Drobo Road. The attack was thwarted after a timely intervention by a Police Patrol Team.







During interrogation, suspects Kwafo Samuel and Shadrach Owusu confessed their involvement and identified Johnson Amponsah as the mastermind. They also admitted participating in several other robberies, particularly around Nkaseim in the Ahafo Region.


A follow-up operation led to the arrest of Johnson Amponsah at his hideout at Nyamennae, a suburb of Berekum. A search of his room uncovered quantities of Indian hemp, two motorcycle helmets, and two machetes, which were retained as exhibits.





However, in a separate intelligence-led operation, officers from the Regional Police Intelligence Directorate arrested Latif Mustapha (Star Boy) and Mosby Owusu at Domfete near Berekum. Police say Latif attempted to evade arrest by hiding in the ceiling of his home but was arrested following a thorough search.


The regional commander further noted that checks linked Kwabena Agon Azubilla Akalotey, already on remand for a stealing case, as the original owner of a pistol recovered in earlier investigations.



A search of Latif Mustapha’s room yielded a significant cache, including: Full military camouflage uniform, Military jacket and boots, Toy Glock pistol, Taser, Live and spent foam bullets, Pepper spray, Multiple knives and scissors, Talismans and war regalia, Two laptops, Swimming goggles, and Toffees suspected to be laced with Indian hemp.


Further investigations uncovered a Parabellum Model R-9 Hungarian pistol, loaded with two rounds of 9mm ammunition, concealed in the room of Mosby Owusu. He told police he purchased the weapon from Latif Mustapha for GHS 9,000, though the latter periodically retrieved it from him.





As part of efforts to disrupt a separate criminal chain involved in receiving and transporting stolen motorcycles and tricycles to Côte d’Ivoire, police arrested Kofi Iddrisa and Baba Kumi Foster at Ewiakrom near Nkrankwanta. Three motorcycles and one tricycle were recovered as evidence.


Police noted that on 2nd December 2025, suspects Johnson Amponsah, Shadrach Owusu, and Kwafo Samuel were arraigned before the Fiapre Circuit Court on charges of conspiracy to commit robbery and attempted robbery. They were remanded into police custody to reappear on 22nd December 2025.




On the same day, Latif Mustapha (Star Boy) and Mosby Owusu were arraigned before the Sunyani District Court B on charges of illicit trafficking of firearms, unlawful possession of firearms, and possession of military uniforms without authority. They were remanded to reappear on 15th December 2025.


However, suspects Kofi Iddrisa and Baba Kumi Foster, being investigated for dishonestly receiving stolen items, were granted police enquiry bail pending further investigation.


The Bono Regional Police Command's call for Public Support says efforts are underway to apprehend additional accomplices still at large and to retrieve more illicit weapons linked to the criminal networks.


The Command is urging the public to provide credible information to aid ongoing security operations aimed at enhancing safety and stability across the region

"Police rescue kidnapping victim in Yendi, arrest three suspects after intelligence-led operation","Police in the Northern Region have rescued a kidnapping victim and arrested three suspects following a targeted intelligence-led operation in Wapuli, in the Yendi District.




The Northern Regional Police Commander, DCOP Wisdom Lavoe, confirmed the operation in an internal situation report, explaining that officers acted swiftly after the case was reported to the Tamale Regional Police Intelligence Directorate on 2 December 2025. According to the report, the kidnappers had demanded GH¢100,000 from the victim’s family.





DCOP Lavoe deployed a five-member intelligence team to Wapuli to monitor the suspects, rescue the victim and arrest those involved. The team successfully freed the victim on 5 December.


Police say the officers later engaged the suspects in a firefight at about 2:30 a.m. on 6 December after trailing them to a hideout. The armed group, believed to be four men, fled the scene and abandoned a motorbike with registration M-25-NR and a Samsung phone, which were retrieved for investigations.


The intelligence team tracked the fleeing suspects to Bokpaba, along the Bimbilla–Yendi stretch, later that morning. Three men — Haruna Seidu, 31; Amidu Bande, 30; and Osman Bande, 40 — were arrested and detained at the Yendi Police Station. They are expected to be transferred to the Regional Headquarters in Tamale on 7 December.




Police also recovered two additional motorbikes — one registered M-25-GB 1026 and an unregistered one — as well as GH¢70,000 believed to be part of the ransom the family paid before the victim’s release.


One suspect remains on the run and is believed to have sustained gunshot wounds during the earlier exchange. Police describe him as “armed and dangerous” and have intensified efforts to track him down.


The Northern Regional Police Command says further updates will be provided as investigations continue, and urged the public to volunteer information that may assist in the arrest of the remaining suspect.

"Mafi Traditional Council launches 77th Hogbetsotso Festival, celebrating heritage and unity","The Mafi Traditional Council has officially announced the 77th edition of the Mafi Hogbetsotso Festival, a week-long celebration that will bring together chiefs, community members, and guests from across Ghana and the diaspora to commemorate one of the most significant events in Ewe history.




Scheduled from Monday, December 8, through Saturday, December 13, the festival will culminate in a spectacular grand durbar of chiefs and people at Mafi Adidome, the traditional capital of the Mafi State in the Volta Region.


A Theme Rooted in Progress


This year's celebration carries the powerful theme ""Fostering Unity, Peace, and Love for Development,"" reflecting the Traditional Council's strategic vision to harness cultural heritage as a catalyst for socio-economic transformation.


The theme speaks directly to contemporary challenges facing traditional communities across Ghana, emphasising that sustainable development cannot be achieved without the foundational elements of social cohesion, peaceful coexistence, and collective purpose.




Journey to the Ancestral Homeland


The festival's programme features several profound traditional ceremonies, beginning with the sacred ancestral pilgrimage to Kpordoave, the original settlement of the Mafi people following their historic escape from Notsie in present-day Togo.


In accordance with time-honoured custom, the chiefs of Mafi will cross the River Volta to reach Kpordoave, retracing the steps of their forebears who fled the oppressive rule of the tyrannical King Agorkorli. 


At this hallowed site, sacred ancestral rites will be performed to officially inaugurate the festival, invoking blessings and guidance for the Mafi people in the year ahead.



This pilgrimage serves not merely as a ceremonial formality but as a spiritual reconnection with the ancestors whose courage and determination secured the freedom and future of the Mafi State.


Honoring the Warriors' Legacy


Another highlight of the festival will be the Traditional Procession to Adidome Torkor, a revered site symbolising the battlegrounds and struggles of Mafi's ancestors. 


This symbolic journey by chiefs and community members pays homage to the courage, sacrifices, and resilience displayed by those who defended Mafi's land and heritage against various threats throughout history.




The gathering at Torkor represents more than historical commemoration; it serves as a powerful educational moment for younger generations, connecting them to the values of bravery, unity of purpose, and unwavering commitment to community that defined their ancestors' lives.


A Grand Celebration of Culture


The festival will reach its crescendo on Saturday, December 13, with the grand durbar of chiefs and people. 


This spectacular gathering promises to be a feast for the senses, showcasing Mafi's rich cultural heritage through traditional drumming, vibrant dance performances, magnificent regalia, and the formal display of the chieftaincy hierarchy.




The durbar will bring together distinguished guests from across Ghana, the Volta Region, and members of the Mafi diaspora community, creating a unique convergence of tradition and modernity, history and aspiration.


A Call for Unity and Participation


Speaking about this year's celebration, Togbe Asafo Buatri IV, Acting Paramount Chief and Acting President of the Mafi Traditional Council, emphasised the festival's forward-looking orientation while honouring the past.


""This year's festival will be another layer of building blocks on the strong foundation laid by our forebears and our recent efforts,"" Togbe Asafo Buatri IV stated. ""It is meant to unite all citizens of Mafi, both home and abroad, around a common purpose of development. Our unity, peace, and love remain the bedrock upon which we will build a prosperous future for Mafi.""




The Acting Paramount Chief issued a clarion call to all sons and daughters of Mafi, whether residing in the traditional area or scattered across Ghana and the world, to participate fully in the festivities. 


He also extended invitations to friends of Mafi, corporate institutions, development partners, and cultural enthusiasts to support the festival and contribute to the community's developmental agenda.


The Mafi Hogbetsotso Za holds profound historical significance, commemorating the great escape of the Ewe people from the brutal tyranny of King Agorkorli of Notsie. According to oral tradition, the Ewe people, including the Mafi, endured severe oppression under Agorkorli's despotic rule, which included forced labour, excessive taxation, and various forms of cruelty.


The escape from Notsie represents a defining moment in Ewe history—a collective assertion of the right to freedom and self-determination. 




Walking backwards to confuse their pursuers, the Ewe people made their way to present-day Ghana, where various groups, including the Mafi, established new settlements and rebuilt their communities.


The annual celebration of this event serves multiple purposes: it preserves historical memory, reinforces cultural identity, educates younger generations about their heritage, and provides a platform for community cohesion and development planning.


A Festival for All


The Mafi Traditional Council has extended a warm invitation to all citizens, stakeholders, cultural enthusiasts, tourists, and the general public to participate in the 77th Mafi Hogbetsotso Za. 




Organisers promise that the celebration will be spiritually fulfilling, culturally vibrant, and development-orientated, offering something meaningful for every attendee.


The festival presents a unique opportunity for domestic and international visitors to experience authentic Ghanaian traditional culture, witness centuries-old customs and rituals, and engage with a community deeply committed to preserving its heritage while embracing progress.


Looking Ahead


As the Mafi Traditional Council prepares for this milestone celebration, the 77th Hogbetsotso Festival represents more than an annual ceremony—it embodies a community's determination to honour its past while building a prosperous future.


The theme of unity, peace, and love for development suggests a mature understanding that cultural preservation and modernisation need not be antagonistic forces but can work in harmony to uplift communities.


With the festival just days away, anticipation is building throughout the Mafi State and beyond. The coming week promises to be a time of reflection, celebration, reunion, and renewed commitment to the values that have sustained the Mafi people through centuries of challenges and triumphs.

Fire ravages shop at Kukurantumi,"A fierce fire swept through a commercial shop on Kukurantumi-Banana Street on December 3, 2025, destroying merchandise and property before firefighters were able to bring the blaze under control.




The Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) reported receiving a distress call at 10:59 p.m., prompting an emergency response team led by ADO I Somuah to rush to the scene. Upon arrival, the shop was engulfed in flames, sending thick smoke into the surrounding area.


Firefighters worked under challenging conditions to suppress the fire and prevent it from spreading to neighboring buildings. Within an hour, the blaze was fully contained and extinguished.


The fire caused extensive damage to items inside the shop, including electronics, furniture, and other commercial goods. Authorities credited the rapid response of the GNFS with preventing a larger disaster in the busy commercial area.


No casualties were reported, and investigations are underway to determine the exact cause of the fire.

"OtumfuoNewmont AI for youth center launched in Sankore, Ahafo Region","The Otumfuo Osei Tutu II Foundation, in partnership with Newmont, has officially commissioned the Otumfuo Newmont AI for Youth Center in Sankore the fourth of six Smart Labs being rolled out across Ghana to expand access to cutting-edge digital and future-ready education. 




The lab, fully funded by Newmont and set up by Coral Reef Innovation Africa (CRIA), is another realisation of the Otumfuo Foundation’s vision to create learning opportunities for Ghana’s youth, no matter where they are.


The new centre forms part of a landmark effort to equip young people in underserved communities with hands-on skills in artificial intelligence, robotics, coding, problem-solving, digital creativity, and STEM learning. 





The initiative advances the shared vision of the Otumfuo Foundation, Newmont, and Coral Reef Innovation Africa to promote access, equity, and inclusion in education for every Ghanaian child.


The launch in Sankore follows significant achievements already recorded at the AI for Youth Centres in Wioso and Kona, where the initiative has ignited remarkable transformations in learning outcomes and student creativity.







In Wioso, students training in the Smart Lab placed 5th nationwide at the 2024 Ghana Robotics Competition a groundbreaking achievement for a community previously underserved in digital literacy.


In Kona, the impact went even further. In 2025, the robotics team from Kona D/A Primary and JHS emerged National Champions at the Ghana Robotics Competition in Accra, outperforming elite schools from across the country. 


Their victory delivered powerful proof of what becomes possible when rural learners are given the tools, mentorship, and opportunities to thrive.





Social Performance Director at Newmont, Joseph Danso, remarked that, “These results show that brilliance exists everywhere. When we level the playing field, Ghana’s children from Wioso to Kona, and now Sankore rise to meet the challenge. The future of innovation in Ghana will not only come from cities; it will come from every community.”



The new Sankore AI for Youth Center is equipped to support students from various schools across the district. Its features include:


• AI & robotics training systems• Digital literacy workstations• Hands-on STEM kits• Teacher training modules• A supportive environment for inclusive learning


The facility is built to serve girls, boys, and learners with diverse needs, promoting equal access to 21st-century skills.


The Otumfuo Foundation emphasised that this project aligns with the vision of His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, which places education, youth development, and opportunity creation at the heart of community transformation. “Today’s event is more than a celebration of infrastructure; it is a symbol of possibility and empowerment,” said Elaine Oppong-Peprah, Administrator of the Foundation.




Newmont’s continued investment in the AI for Youth initiative reinforces its long-term commitment to empowering communities with future-ready skills, digital competence, and pathways to employment in a rapidly evolving global economy.


“This project is an investment in human potential. The youth of Sankore deserve access to the same opportunities as any child in Accra, New York, or London. We are proud to support a programme that is shaping Ghana’s next generation of innovators,” said Joseph Danso.





He further added that, “Newmont has committed over 1.7 million GHS towards establishing six of such educational facilities under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Otumfuo Foundation.”


Coral Reef Innovation Africa, the implementing partner, continues to train teachers and mentor students across all established Smart Labs. CRIA’s model focuses not only on technology access, but also on nurturing confidence, creativity, and problem-solving among young learners.




“Our mission is simple: ‘Empower Tomorrow Today.’ With each new centre, we are building ecosystems where children can learn, create, compete, and lead. Sankore is now part of a growing network of communities proving that Ghana’s innovation future is in strong and brilliant hands. The results from Wioso and Kona prove that brilliance exists everywhere. When rural learners gain access, they rise. Sankore is the next chapter,” said Audrey-Bertha Nartey, Country Lead, Coral Reef Innovation Africa.

Govt lifts curfew in Sawla-Tuna-Kalba after security improves,"The Government of Ghana has lifted the curfew imposed on the Sawla-Tuna-Kalba Township and its surrounding communities in the Savannah Region. 




The Ministry of the Interior imposed a curfew on Bole Township and its surrounding communities in the Savannah Region on Wednesday, August 27, following renewed chieftaincy tensions that have raised security concerns in the area.


The announcement was made by the Minister for the Interior following advice from the Savannah Regional Security Council (REGSEC) and the issuance of an Executive Instrument authorising the immediate removal of the restriction.


The curfew, which had been in place due to security concerns in the area, has been withdrawn after authorities reported a significant improvement in peace and stability across the township and its environs.

 Security assessments indicated a reduction in tensions, allowing normal activities to resume without heightened risk.




Despite the improved situation, the government has urged residents including Chiefs, Opinion Leaders, youth groups, and the general public to continue exercising restraint amid ongoing challenges. 





The Ministry emphasised the need for community members to channel grievances and concerns through peaceful and lawful means. 


“Government continues to urge Chiefs, Opinion Leaders, Youth, and People of the area to exercise restraint in the face of the challenges confronting them and to use non-violent means to channel their energies into ensuring peace in the area,” the statement read.

Australias social media ban for children has left big tech scrambling,"When Stephen Scheeler became Facebook's Australia chief in the early 2010s, he was a true believer in the power of the internet and social media for the public good.




It would herald a new era of global connection and democratise learning. It would let users build their own public squares without the traditional gatekeepers.


""There was that heady optimism phase when I first joined, and I think a lot of the world shared that,"" he told the BBC.


But by the time he left the firm in 2017, seeds of doubt about its work had been planted, and they've since bloomed.


""There's lots of good things about these platforms, but there's just too much bad stuff,"" he surmises.




That's no longer an uncommon view as scrutiny of the largest social media companies has increased around the globe. A lot of it has centred on teenagers, who have emerged as a lucrative market for incredibly wealthy global firms - at the expense of their mental health and wellbeing, according to critics.


Various governments, from the state of Utah to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media.


But the most radical step so far is set to unfold in Australia - a ban for under-16s that kicks in on 10 December has left tech companies scrambling.


Many of the social media firms affected have spent a year loudly protesting against the new law, which requires them to take ""reasonable steps"" to keep underage users from having accounts on their platforms.



They have claimed this ban actually risks making children less safe, argued it impinges on their rights, and repeatedly pointed to the questions around the tech that will be used to enforce the policy.


""Australia is engaged in blanket censorship that will make its youth less informed, less connected, and less equipped to navigate the spaces they will be expected to understand as adults,"" said Paul Taske from NetChoice, a trade group representing several big tech companies.


The worry inside the industry is that Australia's ban - the first of its kind - may inspire other countries.


""It could become a proof of concept that gains traction around the world,"" says Nate Fast, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.




Whistleblowers, lawsuits and questions


(L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in January


In recent years, multiple whistleblowers and lawsuits have claimed that social media firms are prioritising profits over user safety.


In January, a landmark trial will begin in the US hearing allegations that several – including Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube – have designed their apps to be addictive and knowingly covered up the harm their platforms cause. 


All deny this, but Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snap boss Evan Spiegel have both been ordered to testify in person.


The case consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, and is among the first to advance from a flood of similar lawsuits which allege social media contributes to poor mental health and child exploitation.




In another ongoing case, state prosecutors alleged that Zuckerberg personally scuttled efforts to improve the well-being of teens on the company's platforms, including vetoing a proposal to ditch Instagram's face-altering beauty filters, which experts say fuel body dysmorphia and eating disorders.


Former Meta employees Sarah Wynn-Williams, Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar have given testimony before the US Congress alleging a range of wrongdoing they observed during their stints at the company.


Meta maintains that the company has worked diligently to create tools that keep teens safe online.


But the broader industry has also recently been taken to task over mis- and disinformation, hate speech and violent content.




Graphic footage of the assassination of Charlie Kirk was rapidly spread on various platforms, even confronting people who were not seeking it out. Elon Musk has sued states in the US over laws that require social media firms, including X, to define and disclose how they fight hate speech online. And Meta was heavily criticised earlier this year after announcing it was getting rid of factcheckers who monitor its platforms for misinformation.


A rare bipartisan front has emerged among American lawmakers eager to cut tech bosses down to size.


During a hearing last year, Zuckerberg was prodded by one to apologise to bereaved families who had come to watch in person. Among those in the audience was Tammy Rodriguez, whose 11-year old daughter Selena took her life after facing sexual exploitation on Instagram and Snapchat.


""This is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer,"" Zuckerberg said.




Public scrutiny and private lobbying


However, there's widespread criticism from many experts, lawmakers and parents - even kids - who feel social media companies are hiding from genuine action and accountability on these issues.


As Australia's social media ban was considered, then formulated, the firms had little to say publicly.


""Hiding from the public discourse… it just breeds more suspicion and more distrust,"" Mr Scheeler says.


Privately though, many were seeking to bend the government's ear. Spiegel personally sat down with Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells. She also claimed YouTube had sent globally renowned children's entertainers The Wiggles to lobby on their behalf.




In carefully worded public statements, several of the firms have tried to push responsibility elsewhere. Meta and Snap both said operators of the major app stores – namely Apple and Google – should take on age verification duties.


And many argued government is overstepping. Parents know best, they say, and they should decide what makes sense for their teens when it comes to social media use.


Along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.


""While we're committed to meeting our legal obligations, we've consistently raised concerns about this law… There's a better way: legislation that empowers parents to approve app downloads and verify age allows families - not the government - to decide which apps teens can access,"" a statement from Meta provided to the BBC said.


Asked why her government was unsympathetic to this reasoning - why anything short of a ban was unacceptable - Wells said the tech companies have had plenty of time to improve their practices.


""They have had 15, 20 years in this space to do that of their own volition now, and… it's not enough.""


Leaders in other countries feel the same, and have been knocking on her door for help, she says, rattling off the EU, Fiji, Greece, even Malta, as examples.


Denmark and Norway have already begun work on similar laws, and Singapore and Brazil are watching closely too.


""We're pleased to be the first, we're proud to be the first, and we stand ready to help any other jurisdiction who seeks to do these things,"" Wells said.


Too little, too late?


As the Australia ban loomed, the mounting pressure prompted the companies to introduce versions of their products marketed as safer for young users, said Pinar Yildirim, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.


Australia, after all, is a major market for social platforms. At parliamentary hearings in October Snapchat said it believed it had about 440,000 account users in the country aged between 13 and 15. TikTok said it had about 200,000 under-16 accounts and Meta said it had about 450,000 between Facebook and Instagram.


Experts say they are also eager to ensure they don't lose others in even larger markets around the world.


Former Meta engineer Arturo Béjar speaks during a rally


In July, YouTube announced the rollout of AI technology that estimates a user's age in a bid to identify those younger than 18 and better shield them from harmful content.


Snapchat has special accounts for children which it says put safety and privacy settings on by default for users between the ages of 13 and 17.


And last year, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen accounts which similarly place users younger than 18 into more restricted privacy and content settings that Meta says are designed to limit unwanted contacts and exposure to explicit content. This development was accompanied by a massive marketing blitz in the US.


""If they create a more protected environment for these users, the thinking is, that may reduce some of the damage,"" Yildirim said.


Yet critics aren't satisfied. Béjar, one of the Meta whistleblowers, led a study published in September that found almost two thirds of the new safety tools on Meta's Instagram Teen accounts were ineffective.


""The key issue here is that Meta and other social media companies aren't substantively addressing the harm we know teens are experiencing,"" Béjar told the BBC.


Critics say social media firms haven't done enough to protect children


Forced onto the defensive, the companies have attempted to convey that they are making a good faith effort to comply with Australia's impending ban despite their disagreement with it.


But analysts say they'll be hoping the hurdles - which include legal challenges, technology loopholes for kids, and any unintended consequences of the ban - could bolster the case against such moves in other nations.


And the companies ""have a fair bit of influence in how smoothly things go"", Professor Fast points out.


""[They] have an incentive to walk the very fine line about complying, but making sure that they don't comply so good that all the rest of the other countries go, 'Great, that works. Let's do the same',"" Mr Scheeler agrees.


Former Facebook Australia chief Stephen Scheeler says social media companies have hidden from public discourse about the ban


And the fines - a maximum of A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) for serious breaches - might just be seen as the cost of doing business, according to Carnegie Mellon University marketing professor Ari Lightman. ""[They're] a drop in the bucket,"" he says, especially for larger players eager to secure their next generation of potential users.


Despite the concerns around the policy's implementation, Mr Scheeler says he feels like this is a ""seatbelt moment"" for social media.


""Some would argue that bad regulation is worse than no regulation, and sometimes that's true, but I think in this instance, even imperfect regulation is better than nothing, or better than what we had before,"" he says.


""Maybe it will work, maybe it won't work, but at least we're trying something.""

Trump gives Nvidia green light to sell advanced AI chips to China,"US President Donald Trump has announced that he will allow AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to ""approved customers"" in China.




""We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America's lead in AI,"" Trump said on social media on Monday.


The decision will apply to other US chip companies like AMD and comes after extensive lobbying by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, who visited Washington last week to drum up support.


Nvidia - both the world's leading chip firm and most valuable company - has found itself at the centre of a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China in recent months, and had been banned from selling its most advanced chips to Beijing.


Trump reversed the chip-selling ban in July, but demanded that Nvidia pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government.




Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to stop buying Nvidia chips manufactured for use in the Chinese market.


""We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,"" Nvidia said in a statement provided to BBC News.


Nvidia's H200 is a generation behind its Blackwell chip, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor.


Mr Huang told the BBC in September that the US needed ""to make sure that people can access this technology from all over the world, including China.""



He has also repeatedly warned that China, which has cultivated a chip production ecosystem of its own, was close behind the US in chip development.


Nvidia hailed Trump's announcement on Monday.


""Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,"" Nvidia said in its statement.


The companies shares rose slightly on the news.




Trump said ""$25% [sic] will be paid to the United States of America"" in his post.


The BBC has reached out to the White House for clarification on the arrangement, which will likely face opposition from national security hawks in Congress.


The sale of H200 chips to some Chinese customers ""buys time"" for the US to negotiate a deal with Beijing over rare earths and prevent major disruptions to global supply chains, Alex Capri from the National University of Singapore said.


China holds a near-monopoly on the processing of rare earth minerals, which are essential for the production of most electronics.




Although access to H200 chips is likely to benefit China's technology sector, Beijing is still expected to work towards reducing dependence on the US, Mr Capri said.


Beijing had previously directed local tech firms to reject Nvidia's older H20 chips and encouraged them to buy domestically produced semiconductors, he noted.


Researchers at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) said China's People's Liberation Army is using advanced chips designed by US companies to develop AI-enabled military capabilities.


""By making it easier for the Chinese to access these high-quality AI chips, you enable China to more easily use and deploy AI systems for military applications,"" said Cole McFaul, senior research analyst at CSET. ""They want to harness advanced chips for battlefield advantage.""

Trump to issue order creating national AI rule,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order this week that he said would create a single national rule for artificial intelligence, which the industry has said is necessary to override disparate laws passed by U.S. states.




The move would deliver a win for Big Tech companies that have cultivated close relationships with the White House, and likely draw consternation from both Democratic and Republican state leaders who have said they need the ability to protect state residents.


The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day. Sign up here.


""There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI... I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week. You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something,"" Trump said in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.


Trump did not provide details but Reuters reported last month that the U.S. president was considering an executive order that would seek to preempt state laws on AI through lawsuits and by withholding federal funding.




ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Alphabet, Google, Meta Platforms, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz have called for national AI standards instead of a 50-state patchwork of laws, arguing that these laws stifle innovation. The companies argue that the U.S. will fall behind China on AI development if states are allowed to regulate the technology.


And yet state leaders from both major political parties have stressed the need for AI guardrails. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, introduced legislation he said would create an AI bill of rights including data privacy, parental controls and consumer protections.


Other states have passed laws prohibiting the use of AI to create nonconsensual sexual imagery, banning unauthorized political deepfakes and seeking to prevent AI from being used to discriminate. California, home to several major AI companies, will require major developers to explain plans to mitigate potential catastrophic risks.


Trump last month called on Congress to add language blocking state AI laws to an upcoming defence bill. The proposal has faced pushback from Republican and Democratic state lawmakers and attorneys general.



""Congress can’t fail to create real safeguards and then block the states from stepping up,"" North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said at the time.


The Senate voted 99-1 against an effort to block AI laws this year after pushback from state leaders and consumer groups.

Network issues fixed after extra spectrum to telcos  Dep. Communications Minister,"Deputy Communications Minister, Mohammed Adams Sukparu, says the government has successfully resolved the nationwide mobile network challenges following the allocation of additional spectrum to major telecommunications companies, including MTN and Telecel (formerly Vodafone).




Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, December 2, the minister noted that earlier in the year, widespread complaints emerged over poor call quality and frequent call drops, affecting subscribers across all networks.


According to him, President John Dramani Mahama subsequently directed the Communications Ministry to take decisive action to address the situation. 


This, he noted, led to the release of additional spectrum to the telcos to boost capacity and improve the quality of service.


“So government took steps by issuing spectrum to the telecommunications companies, most especially Telecel and MTN. A lot of work has gone on behind the scenes, and that is why we are all witnessing significant improvement in the quality of network service,” he said.




He reiterated that the enhanced spectrum has enabled the telcos to upgrade their systems, resulting in better call clarity and more stable connectivity nationwide.

The stuff under the stuff: People with hoarding disorder open up,"The habit crept up on Kim. She would arrive at garage sales as they were ending to pick up what remained.




“I’d load my car full of the free stuff on the side of the road: clothes, things that needed to be fixed, projects,” she told CNN.


It was only once things spiraled that Kim, 53, who asked to be identified by her first name to protect her privacy, realized she had a problem that was all too familiar: hoarding, a disorder that she’d spent years urging her mother to seek help for.


“I used to get very frustrated and say, ‘Mom, we’ve helped you clean out this room 10 times, and we come back three months later and it’s completely full of sh*t ,” she said.


“I learned about hoarding disorder when I was younger but somehow didn’t recognize it in myself.”




At first, Kim would pile the things around her bed and throughout her bedroom, eventually expanding into other areas of her home, including her living room and sunporch.


Besides the garage sales, she would collect stuff at thrift stores and stored goods she said family gave her “to hold and keep.”


What is hoarding?





Today Kim runs a Facebook support group for 2,100 people with hoarding disorder, which the World Health Organization categorized as a mental health condition in 2018, five years after the condition was added to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. HD is characterized by excessive accumulation of possessions and difficulty in disposing of them .



Kim only sought help when things became unsafe. “The stuff starts piling up, the paths get narrower, and you start to trip (in your own house),” said the single mother.


“Putting things in the garbage is a big struggle — if we know it might go to the right home, that makes us feel better.“


She thinks that mindset dates back to what her grandmother used to say: “Use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without,” she said. “That was a phrase that was knocked into my head ever since I was little,” and it makes her worry about wasting anything.


What people hoard varies: Kim’s focus is books. “It would have taken me 10 lifetimes to read them,” she said of the many boxes she gave away after extensive therapy, including “500 Dr. Phil books.”




Two-thirds of people with the disorder have at least one other psychiatric condition, while physical comorbidities such as arthritis and diabetes are common, according to a 2024 US Senate report. Around 14 million Americans are affected by hoarding disorder, with similar rates across other Western countries.


Hoarding can trigger countless complications, experts say. Bathrooms and kitchens can become unusable, impacting diet and personal hygiene. Housing authorities can threaten eviction leading to homelessness, while in extreme cases children have been removed by social services.


There is also risk to life. Excessive stuff, especially books and paperwork, pose a serious fire hazard and can hamper rescue efforts by blocking escape routes.


Why do people hoard?


Collecting may be in our DNA, according to Dr. Nick Neave, a professor in the psychology department at Northumbria University in the United Kingdom and director of the university’s Hoarding Research Group.




“Throughout history possessions have always been very important — you see people buried with grave goods,” he said. “That urge to collect things, it’s part of your personality, your culture. So hoarding is normal — we’ve all got stuff we don’t need.”


What separates regular collecting from hoarding is often trauma, Neave said.


“All the people who hoard I’ve ever met had traumatic childhoods, whether it’s physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, chaotic backgrounds, lack of parents.”


This resonates with Kim, whose symptoms emerged after she experienced an abusive relationship, the death of a friend and a serious medical diagnosis.




“We call it the stuff under the stuff,” said Kim, who lives in New York state. “One of our therapists calls it the one, two, three punch. You can handle one trauma, maybe two, but after that, a lot of people will have hoarding disorder creep in.”


“I tried to fill the hole in my heart and soul with the stuff,” she added.


Neave says hoarding is a “coping strategy which starts off working very well” but can “spiral quickly into a severe addiction and mental health problem that is very difficult to resolve.”


Shame and stigma can then lead to further isolation, he said. “The obvious thing to do is get rid of the clutter, but that doesn’t solve the problem of why they’ve got it in the first place. If you’re not treating that issue, it’ll come back.”

"Nude beach etiquette: Lose your clothes, not your manners","Most of us have felt the freedom and delight that comes with stripping down to a swimsuit on a sunny day and wading into a cool sea, the horizon twinkling in the distance.




But what of shedding those final strips of fabric and going nude? The birthday suit is, after all, the world’s oldest costume and one that never goes out of style.


The naturist movement emerged in Europe at the end of the 19th century and is now popular around the world. Globally, there are hundreds of clothing-optional beaches where it’s perfectly legal to drop your shorts and your inhibitions, and the number is growing.


Fans of naturism can now take nude cruises around the Caribbean or plan a naked wedding on an Italian island.


If you’re a newbie to nudity but are interested in knowing more, we have some tips on beach and resort etiquette from naturism experts with decades of unclothed experience. Here’s their dos and don’ts and what you should know before you go.




1. Do your research


“Naturism means different things to different people and the term is sometimes misused,” says Stéphane Deschênes, president of the International Naturist Federation (INF-FNI), the world’s only global naturism organisation. “So you have to understand what you’re looking for.”


There’s no single naturist ideology, but typically the lifestyle is about non-sexual social nudity in a family-friendly environment.


“Fortunately, naturism has always been very well organized,” says Deschênes. The INF-FNI aims to help people find consistency and reliability when choosing naturist resorts and has been doing so for more than 70 years.


2. Take the plunge


So you’ve arrived at your chosen beach or resort and you feel like everyone’s looking at you. They’re not.



“Nobody knows this is your first time,” says Ronna Krozy, a retired professor in her 80s who’s been a nudist for more than 30 years. In 2023, she showed CNN the ropes at Solair Recreation League, a family nudist resort and campground in Woodstock, Connecticut.


“In fact, it might be easier to go to somewhere with tons of people and just get on with it, or better yet, get everything off,” she says.


Like going into the water itself, sometimes it’s better just to dive straight in.


3. Keep your distance


Behave like you’re at a “church picnic,” says Krozy, who is also public relations chair at the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR), the leading naturist organisation in the United States.




“Don’t park your chair or your blanket too close to anybody,” she adds. “Anything that appears like sexual activity, like plastering your body against somebody else, is not allowed.”


And while nudists are known for packing light, there’s one item you should never be without.


“Always bring a towel with you to sit on, because that is for everybody’s hygiene.”


4. Don’t stare or take photos


Making eye contact? Starting up a friendly conversation? All this is more than welcome says Krozy. “Look people in the eye, because that might help you to figure out where to put your attention, and don’t gawk or stare because that is considered rude and impolite.”




Sunglasses are, of course, a common beach accessory – but don’t try hiding behind them to sneak a peek at your neighbors.


Taking pictures or videos without people’s permission is also a huge no-no.  Just because you lose your clothes doesn’t mean you should lose your manners.


It’s simply decent human conduct to not be “too aggressive” or “make people uncomfortable by not giving them enough space,” says Deschênes. “These are all sensible things to do in all situations.”


5. Don’t comment on people’s bodies


“You shouldn’t talk about anybody’s body, even if you think it’s a compliment,” says Krozy.




While we live in an increasingly open-minded society when it comes to displaying flesh, it’s a double-edged sword, says Deschênes. “In some ways, people are less shocked by the idea of nudity, but in another, that nudity has generally been hypersexualized and objectified.”


A common misperception, he says, is that “people often think naturism is about not wearing clothes. But that’s not the objective. That’s simply the tool that we use to achieve body acceptance.”


The happy upshot of this, he says, is that “it creates better relationships between people because they are more open and honest and true about who they are in themselves.” 


Clothing isn’t just a protective covering, Deschênes says. “Mostly clothing is about rank and status and hiding who we are and trying to make ourselves look in a way that society tells us you’re supposed to be.”




6. Arousal isn’t the problem you think it is


Both Krozy and Deschênes say that one of the questions they’re most often asked is what happens if a man gets physically excited. The truth is, it doesn’t happen that often.


“It’s a great fear,” since Deschênes, “and it’s understandable since most men have spent their entire life connecting nudity and sex.”


However, the non-sexual nature of the environment in general means it’s a rare occurrence, he says, and also, “when you’re very nervous as a man, it doesn’t work very well.”


Krozy has this advice, however, for any guy who finds himself caught out: “Take your towel and cover yourself. Turn over in the sand. Run into the cold water.” If all else fails, focus on dull thoughts like “taking out your garbage.”




Likewise, a common question from women is what they should do if they’re on their period. The answer is that they should do whatever makes them feel most comfortable.


They can wear underwear if they prefer pads, they can use menstrual cups if that’s their style, or if they like tampons, they can use those too. “You know, if somebody sees the string, that’s okay,” says Deschênes. “Having a period is a normal part of life.”


7. Don’t get your alternative lifestyles confused


In our globalized, hyperconnected world, communities of like-minded people can find each other with greater ease than ever before, making it a golden age for alternative lifestyles. But don’t be tempted to think of discrete communities of naturists, nudists, polyamorists, ethical non-monogamists and fetish enthusiasts as one big bundle.


“We always get lumped in with the sexually liberated people and that’s never been who we are and still isn’t,” says Deschênes. “There’s nothing wrong with all those other communities – my only problem is when you mix them up. A friend of mine gave a really good analogy. He said, ‘You can play tennis, and you can play baseball, but you don’t try to play baseball on a tennis court.’”


8. Enjoy the experience? Then explore more


So you’ve explored your local options and now you want to go further afield. “In terms of scale. France is by far the No.1 destination for naturism and has been for many years,” says Deschênes. “They’ve always had the advantage of having lots of nice beaches, the ocean and the sea.”


Germany has lots of great naturist opportunities too, and because of the long-standing cultural acceptance of nudity, you can sometimes shed your garments in less formal settings, such as parks. It’s also very common in spas - he recommends the Taunus Thermae, just outside of Frankfurt.


“You might not think of Thailand, for example, as a naturist destination, but there are some lovely resorts there,” says Deschênes. 


“It’s very limited to those resorts, because the culture generally is not favorable to naturism. But there are some beautiful resorts, and the country is very accepting of them. Then of course, there are lots of opportunities in the Caribbean, and even South America.”


This advice in hand, all you need to do is start packing. Don’t forget the sunscreen.

Ticks are taking over city parks  heres how to avoid them,"In the compact backyards of Staten Island, Maria Diuk-Wasser was surprised by what she saw. Ticks—and lots of them—nestled in wood piles, between leaves, and underneath bird feeders. It was more than she found in the previous year and the year before that.




Diuk-Wasser, a disease ecologist at Columbia University, had been tracking tick activity in the New York City borough for four years ending in 2021, and found that, year after year, ticks were expanding both in numbers and geographically. “There were many more ticks in more of the parks, and more and more backyards,” Diuk-Wasser says. And early data suggest a similar phenomenon may be unfolding nearby in Queens and Brooklyn. 


What’s happening across New York City is reflective of a larger trend: Tick populations are booming across the United States—as are tickborne diseases, like Lyme disease, which have more than doubled over the past two decades. And when there’s an explosion of ticks, we inevitably see more of them crawling across cities, says Diuk-Wasser. 


Indeed ticks, as growing evidence shows, are an emerging urban threat. Here’s what you need to know about where to find them—and how to protect yourself from tickborne diseases.


How do ticks get into cities anyway?


There are multiple species of tick, but in the United States, researchers are most concerned with four—the black-legged (deer) tick, the lone star tick, the dog tick, and the longhorned tick. Many have been venturing into regions they haven’t historically called home, and they’re multiplying.




Back in Staten Island, for example, Diuk-Wasser and her team recently recorded a startling spike in deer ticks (long-term residents of the eastern U.S.), lone star ticks (which have historically been concentrated in southeastern and south-central states) and longhorned ticks (which were found for the very first time in the U.S. in 2017). “They really spread in a matter of years. It was very fast,” she says.


But what’s really alarming is the rise of the one species that causes Lyme disease—the black-legged deer tick. According to Diuk-Wasser, these arthropods can live in any area that’s forested or contains leaf litter—the layer of dead leaves, twigs, and plant debris that provide ticks with the thick humidity they need to stay hydrated. That means a leafy park in the city can be just as attractive as the undisturbed woods they’ve commonly used as habitat.


And ticks have moved into these parks by hitchhiking on the backs other animals. Ticks can exist wherever there are hosts—whether that be raccoons, mice, birds, squirrels, or possums. That’s why you’ll even find ticks in Central Park, a greenspace famously landlocked by concrete.


But in order to truly thrive, ticks require deer. As such, the biggest factor that influences whether an urban tick community will swell is if there’s a pathway for deer to enter. “As long as deer visit, you will find ticks,” Diuk-Wasser says. For example, ticks were able to take up residence in Staten Island on the backs of the deer that swim to the borough from New Jersey.



What’s causing so many ticks to invade cities?


Let’s start with land use changes. Ticks long occupied the land where cities now stand, but were displaced in the 1800s as forests were knocked down for agricultural purposes—forced to go wherever trees were lush and leaves were moist. But as farming declined in the U.S. in the 1900s and people abandoned their pastures, areas near cities were reforested—and many towns and cities on the East Coast and up in the Great Lakes were built smack in the middle of those forests, says Nick Takacs, a Northeastern University biology professor who studies ticks. In the years that followed, wildlife—including deer and white-legged mice—returned, ticks in tow.


“We densely colonized a lot of their environments, so they had no choice but to adapt and live in the environments we shared,” Takacs says.


Many of the animals that make for ideal tick hosts actually prefer to hunt and live near what’s called ""the edge""—the space where two habitats like the woods (that offer protection) and grasslands (rich with edible vegetation) collide. So as we’ve built sprawling cities near and in forests, wildlife has migrated to the edge and into nearby parks and backyards, transporting ticks with them, says Diuk-Wasser. It doesn’t help that deer populations are multiplying due to increased hunting restrictions and fewer predators. The same is happening with mice.


At the same time, climate change is majorly impacting tick activity. Decades ago, ticks would die out come winter, but warmer weather has extended tick season. “Adult ticks can be active in the winter if it’s above 40 degrees, which happens all the time now,” says Diuk-Wasser.




Additionally, regions that were once too frigid for ticks are now suitable for them. Deer ticks and lone star ticks—plus the pathogens they carry—are moving further north, planting roots all along the Eastern seaboard, New England, and into Canada. Ticks can now feed and breed year-round. They’re proliferating—in rural spaces and urban ones.


Even the deadly brown dog tick, which becomes more active and aggressive in extreme heat, is infiltrating California cities, says Janet Foley, a veterinarian and disease ecologist at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Once found in rural desert areas, these ticks are finding places to thrive in cities that are getting both warmer and dryer. “The hotter it gets, the more likely they are to feed on anything,” she says. 


How should you protect yourself from ticks in cities?


The odds you’ll be exposed to an infected tick in a city park is on par with the chance you’ll run into one on a wooded hike. In some cities, roughly 20 to 30 percent of baby ticks (nymphs) are infected with the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, research shows. “You do see cases where people acquired Lyme disease from urban parks,” says Foley.


Therefore, you should protect yourself in certain urban greenspaces the same way you would if you were hiking or camping. You don’t need to worry as much about being bitten in Central Park (though, yes, it has ticks too), but if you’re visiting a city park or backyard that wildlife can access from nearby woods? It’s a good idea to use DEET, wear permethrin-treated clothing, and check yourself for ticks, says Diuk-Wasser. If you wander off the main trails, try not to brush alongside high grasses as that’s where ticks cling to stems, waiting for you.




This isn’t to deter you from being in nature—it’s just to inform you that ticks are all around us, even where there are taxis and stadiums. “Our cities are not as domesticated as we thought they were,” says Takacs. “We have to adapt to that.”

Nigeria: Uproar as 18-year-old boy impregnates 10 girls in Anambra,"An 18-year-old randy boy has impregnated no fewer than 10 girls in Anambra State.




The Anambra State Commissioner for Women’s Affairs and Social Welfare, Ify Obinabo, disclosed this in a social media video, saying the matter was brought before her on Tuesday.


Two of the pregnant girls are his master’s daughter and salesgirl, while the eight others were impregnated just two months after he returned to the village, having been sent packing by his boss.


According to Obinabo, in a live video she shared on social media seeking advice, she said: “I want advice from the public because this one is beyond my capacity.


“This boy was sent to learn a trade at the age of 18 and, three months into the apprenticeship, he impregnated his oga’s daughter and his salesgirl. He was sent packing. Two months after that, he impregnated eight others in the village.




“The mother reported the matter to my office, saying anytime she sees a girl coming towards her house nowadays, her heart would jump and that she needs help.


“This matter is beyond me; that’s the reason I want the public to help me come up with a solution. Is it spiritual?


“I asked the boy the magic he uses in luring the girls to bed, but he told me he always tells them that he loves them and would like to marry them anytime he acquires wealth.”


She said: “This problem is beyond me because of the boy’s age and the number of pregnant girls involved. That’s why I need help to solve it.”

Many would be home if Ghana were half as developed as US  Victor Smith urges diasporans to partner investors and return,"Ghana’s Ambassador to the United States, Victor Emmanuel Smith, has called on Ghanaians living abroad to bring their skills home and partner with investors to support the country’s economic transformation.




Speaking during a series of visits to Ghanaian churches in Worcester, Massachusetts, Ambassador Smith highlighted that the nation’s underdevelopment is a key reason many citizens remain abroad.





“Many would be home if Ghana were half as developed as the U.S.,” he said. “It’s painful to see our people seeking opportunities elsewhere, when they could be contributing to the growth of their own country.”


The Ambassador described his mission in the United States as a drive to attract investors and encourage strategic partnerships with the diaspora. He urged skilled Ghanaians to return home and work alongside investors to create industries, jobs, and sustainable development.





“I am expecting that investors will want people with your kind of skills to partner them in Ghana,” he said. “We need your expertise, your experience, and your innovative approaches to help transform our nation.”




He emphasised that creating well-paying jobs is central to reducing migration and fostering national growth. “Jobs, jobs, jobs — that is the priority. We want fewer people feeling forced to leave the country in search of opportunities,” he added.





Ambassador Smith also announced plans for a more formal engagement with the Ghanaian community in Worcester and the Massachusetts area, where he will hold in-depth discussions on development, investment, and diaspora collaboration.

"Transcending Borders: Perfect Compassion Initiatives International Outreach in springs, South Africa","In a profound demonstration of Christ-centered international outreach, Lady Perfect Anette Agbemabiese, Founder of Perfect Compassion Initiative, Perfect Prayer Palace and Ladies in Christ (LIC), led a transformative visit to the Elderly Home in Springs, South Africa to minister love, compassion, and hope to the home's predominantly white residents, aged 60 and above.




 INTERNATIONAL CHARITY: BUILDING BRIDGES OF RECONCILIATION


This remarkable mission highlights the vital role of international Christian charities in bridging racial, cultural, and geographical divides. In a world still grappling with the legacy of racial division, particularly in South Africa's historical context, Perfect Compassion Initiative's visit stands as a living testament to the reconciling power of Christ's love—a love that transcends ethnicity, nationality, and history.





The Apostle Paul declared, ""There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"" (Galatians 3:28). This scriptural truth was beautifully embodied as Ghanaian believers served South African elders, demonstrating that the Body of Christ knows no racial boundaries. Such acts of cross-cultural service dismantle prejudice more effectively than any policy, offering tangible evidence that God's kingdom operates on principles of unity, not division.





ALIGNMENT WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS




Perfect Compassion Initiative's mission aligns strategically with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly:


SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being): Addressing the physical, emotional, and spiritual health needs of elderly populations who often experience loneliness, depression, and inadequate care.





SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Actively working to reduce inequalities based on age, race, and socioeconomic status by ensuring vulnerable elderly populations receive compassionate care regardless of background.


SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): Demonstrating how international faith-based organizations can forge partnerships across borders to address humanitarian needs that transcend national interests.






By integrating biblical principles with global development frameworks, Perfect Compassion Initiative models a holistic approach to Christian service—one that honors both the spiritual and practical dimensions of human flourishing.





LOVE IN ACTION: THE VISIT


During their time at the elderly home, the Perfect Compassion Initiative team didn't merely deliver charity—they delivered presence. They spent meaningful time with residents, offering prayers, and speaking words of encouragement that affirmed each person's inherent dignity and worth.





The joy and gratitude visible on the residents' faces bore witness to the transformative power of genuine Christian compassion.







Madam Pierre, a 90-year-old resident who has called Springs Elderly Home her residence for the past 27 years, served as the leader of the residents during the visit. With deep emotion and gratitude, she thanked the Perfect Compassion Initiative team for their generosity and the love they had traveled so far to share. Her words, spoken on behalf of her fellow residents, affirmed the profound impact of this ministry—a reminder that acts of kindness ripple far beyond the moment, touching hearts and bridging worlds.





As a practical expression of care, the team served 200 packed lunches to the residents, ensuring not only spiritual encouragement but also physical nourishment—a reminder of Jesus' ministry, which consistently attended to both soul and body.


 STRENGTHENING GHANA-SOUTH AFRICA RELATIONS


This visit also highlights the deepening relationship between Ghana and South Africa, two nations with shared histories of struggle, resilience, and faith. By reaching across borders in the spirit of Christian brotherhood, Perfect Compassion Initiative demonstrates that our shared commitment to justice, equality, and human dignity transcends political boundaries.




Such international cooperation among African nations models Pan-African solidarity rooted not in mere rhetoric but in sacrificial service. It declares that we are rising to fulfill our calling as a light to the nations, ministering healing where there has been hurt, and building bridges where there have been barriers.


A CALL TO REMEMBRANCE AND ACTION


Perfect Compassion Initiative's mission to Springs Elderly Home exemplifies international Christian cooperation —compassion without condescension, service without superiority, love without limits. Under Lady Perfect Anette Agbemabiese's visionary leadership, this ministry continues to embody the heart of Christ for the marginalized, the forgotten, and the vulnerable.


""Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."" – James 1:27







ABOUT PERFECT COMPASSION INITIATIVE

Through Perfect Prayer Palace and Ladies in Christ (LIC), the organization mobilizes believers to demonstrate Christ's love through practical service, intercessory prayer, local and international missions.

EU shifting focus from development aid to investment support in Ghana  Ambassador Skinnebach,"The European Union (EU) is shifting its cooperation with Ghana from traditional development grants to more sustainable investment partnerships, according to the EU Ambassador to Ghana, Rune Skinnebach.




Speaking on the Joy Super Morning Show on Tuesday, Ambassador Skinnebach said the new approach aims to create conditions that make Ghana more attractive to investors by improving infrastructure, governance, and respect for human rights.


“We are moving away from development grants, and we are moving towards investments,” he said. 


“What we can do, because we still have grants here in Ghana, is that we can create an environment that makes Ghana attractive for investment so the country can benefit from this investment package.”


He noted that the EU is already supporting initiatives that strengthen transport systems and governance structures as part of efforts to enhance Ghana’s investment climate.




The Ambassador added that Ghana’s global reputation on human rights and universal freedoms also plays a critical role in securing long-term investor confidence. 


“It requires infrastructure. We are doing it. It requires governance. We are doing it. It also requires reputation when it comes to human rights and universal freedoms, and we’re doing it,” he emphasised.


The EU’s new development cooperation model reflects a broader strategy across Africa, where the bloc is prioritising trade, private sector growth, and sustainable investments over direct aid. 


In Ghana, this aligns with government efforts to attract foreign capital through initiatives such as the Ghana CARES ‘Obaatan pa’ programme and economic diversification plans.

Grenada seeks to recruit Ghanaian nurses to address severe health worker shortage,"The Government of Grenada has announced its intention to recruit Ghanaian nurses and allied health professionals to help address a critical shortage of health workers in the Caribbean nation. 




The move aligns with Ghana’s Work Abroad Programme aimed at creating more job opportunities for skilled professionals.


This was disclosed during the inaugural Ghana–Grenada political consultation in Accra, led by Dickon Mitchell, Prime Minister of Grenada, who is on a three-day state visit. 


The visit is expected to deepen bilateral relations between the two countries in key areas, including health, education, climate change, trade, and investment.


Grenada’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Export Development, Joseph Andall, highlighted the country’s urgent need for nurses, describing it as one of their most pressing national challenges.




“We welcome the initiative that has been undertaken in terms of the provision of health care professionals, namely nurses. This is an area in which we have a severe shortage,” he said. 


“We spend huge sums of money to train our nurses and then they are approached by countries that can afford to give them better remuneration packages.”


Joseph Andall explained that the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two governments will serve as a framework for structured collaboration in health. 


He added that the partnership also reflects a shared commitment to Pan-African solidarity and mutual development.



“This MoU, when signed, will be a testament to what can be achieved when sisters and brothers come together for mutual assistance,” he noted.


Ghana’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, said the government is keen on leveraging such partnerships to create opportunities for Ghanaian professionals while strengthening South-South cooperation.


“On health cooperation, we particularly welcome Grenada’s interest in recruiting Ghanaian nurses and allied health professionals and look forward to the signing of the memorandum of understanding on health cooperation, which will serve as a framework for this structured collaboration,” he said.


He added that the discussions also covered education and skills development, with a commitment to address challenges faced by some Ghanaian students in Grenada under the Scholarship Secretariat.




The Ghana–Grenada talks also touched on broader areas of collaboration, including trade and investment, climate change, tourism, and multilateral engagements.


Joseph Andall stressed the importance of partnerships between Africa and the Caribbean, noting that small island states like Grenada — with a population of about 120,000 — depend on strong international cooperation to address shared challenges such as climate vulnerability and economic migration.


“We are tiny islands in the Caribbean with very small populations. A rising and strong Africa could help lift our sisters and brothers in South and Central America out of the difficulties they are currently facing,” he added.


Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell’s visit is expected to conclude with a series of high-level engagements with John Dramani Mahama and other government officials, aimed at formalising agreements and strengthening bilateral relations between Ghana and Grenada.

Investment in data production strengthens governance  Deputy Finance Minister,"Deputy Minister of Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, has underscored the importance of investing in quality data to strengthen good governance.




“We know that when we invest in data, we improve the quality of public expenditure, we empower citizens, we energise innovation, and we create opportunities for equitable and inclusive development,” he said.


The Deputy Minister said this at the inaugural 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users, and Enhancers, which also serves to commemorate the 2025 African Statistics Day.


The programme was on the theme: “Financing Innovations in Data and Statistics for Sustainable and Inclusive Development.”


 He said the country was moving from donor-reliant




financing arrangements toward a model grounded in national ownership and sustainable investment.


“I am proud to note that the 2026 budget allocates GH¢207 million to advance critical operations including rebasing GDP and CPI, completing key national surveys, and strengthening economic performance and price measurement,” he said.


The budget, he stressed, also supported the scaling of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Growth (MIEG), placing Ghana among a select group of countries using near-real-time data to manage the economy.


 This tool will enable policy responses up to 10 weeks faster than traditional quarterly estimates.



Mr Ampem said a major reform was the integration of administrative data systems using the Ghana Card’s unique identifier.


This innovation, explained, was projected to cut future census costs by over 70 per cent, while delivering continuous, high-quality population and sectoral data.


He said another transformative measure was the launch of Ghana in Numbers, a new annual, visual, globally benchmarked data publication designed to turn statistics into compelling narratives for the public and policymakers.


To reinforce this ecosystem, he said, the government was reviewing the Statistical Service Act to further strengthen the independence, authority, and global standing of the service.




He said without quality data, planning becomes speculative, policymaking becomes inefficient, and development outcomes become uneven.


“Data drives smarter investments. It ensures that public resources are directed where they are needed most,” he said.


He stated that Ghana had made remarkable strides in modernizing its statistical landscape.


“We delivered West Africa’s first fully digital Population and Housing Census, processing data three times faster than previous cycles.




“We have institutionalised the high‑frequency surveys that provide real‑time insights into welfare, labour market trends and business dynamics,” he said.


Dr Alhassan Iddrisu, the Government Statistician, said the theme reaffirmed that “nation becomes


what it measures, what it funds, and what it chooses to understand.”


“When we produce data well, fund it sustainably, and use it consistently, we strengthen institutions, protect the vulnerable, and open opportunities for every community,” he said.




Dr Wilfred Ochan, Co- Chair, GSSDP Group, said the forum showed the commitment of GSS to achieve its mandate of producing quality data.


He called for investment in the production of data, saying, “Data on its own is not informative unless it is credible, accessible, and put to good use.”

New mpox strain identified in England,"A new strain of mpox, previously called monkeypox, has been detected in a person in England, say UK health officials.




The virus is a mix of two major types of the mpox virus, and was found in someone who recently returned from travelling in Asia.


Officials say they are still assessing the significance of the new strain.


The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it is normal for viruses to evolve. Getting vaccinated remains the best way to protect against severe disease - although an mpox infection is mild for many.


The new virus strain contains elements of two mpox strains, called clade Ib and clade IIb. It currently has no name.




UK health officials recently encouraged gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men to make sure they were vaccinated against mpox.


That call came as a strain called 'clade Ib' showed early signs of local spread in some European countries.


'Clade IIb' is linked to a global outbreak of mpox in 2022 which affected many countries worldwide.


In the UK, vaccination is available for groups of people at highest risk of catching mpox:




those who have multiple sexual partners


those who engage in group sex


those who visit sex-on-premises venues



Health officials say the vaccine is 75-80% effective at protecting against mpox.


There have been no studies on how well the vaccine protects against this latest strain, although it's thought there will be a high degree of protection.


Dr Katy Sinka, head of sexually transmitted infections at UKHSA, said genomic testing had allowed it to be detected.


""It's normal for viruses to evolve, and further analysis will help us understand more about how mpox is changing.




""Getting vaccinated is a proven effective way to protect yourself against severe disease, so please make sure to get the jab if you are eligible,"" she said.


Prof Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network at the University of Oxford, said there were ""excellent systems"" to identify cases and control onward infection in the UK, but in other parts of the world, in more vulnerable populations, ""this is harder to achieve"", where access to vaccines is not as reliable.


Prof Lang said if further cases of this strain appeared in the UK and elsewhere, it would be important to understand how it's being spread and how ill it makes people, in order to assess whether it's more or less dangerous than previous strains.


There have been nearly 48,000 confirmed cases of mpox globally in 2025, and 2,500 in the past month, with most occurring in central Africa.




Dr Boghuma Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, said the new strain is what experts feared would happen if mpox continued to spread worldwide.


""The more mpox circulation we permit, the more opportunities the virus has to recombine and adapt, further entrenching mpox virus as a human pathogen that is not going away,"" she said.


What is mpox?


Mpox can be a unpleasant illness.


Common symptoms are lesions or a skin rash, which can last for two to four weeks, plus fever, headaches, back pain, muscle aches and tiredness.




The virus spreads from person to person through close physical contact, coughs or sneezes and touching infected clothing, bedding or towels.


Health officials say anyone who thinks they might have mpox, should contact NHS 111 for advice on what to do.

Why has Paramount launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery?,"The fight in Hollywood to buy Warner Bros Discovery is shaping up to be a blockbuster.




Paramount Skydance, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, has been wooing Warner Bros for months, hoping to join forces with the storied Hollywood name as the media company struggles to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney.


So far, Warner Bros has spurned its proposals. Then it announced a deal to sell the most valuable parts of its business - its studio and streaming divisions - to Netflix instead.


Undeterred, Paramount chief executive David Ellison launched a hostile takeover bid, making his suit directly to shareholders.


What is a hostile takeover bid?


In corporate deals, a hostile takeover is when a company moves to acquire another firm without the consent of the target company's management, typically by offering to buy its target company's shares.




It differs from a friendly takeover - one that is mutually agreed upon by the boards of directors and shareholders at both companies.


What do we know about the two bids?


Netflix's proposal includes Warner Bros' studio and streaming networks, leaving the rest of the company to be spun off as an independent company.


Its offer values those holdings which include brands such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema, and HBO Max, at $82.7bn, including debt.


Netflix is offering to pay $23.25 per share, and give existing Warner Bros a stake in the new company - a mix of cash and equity it says is worth about $27.75 per share.



Paramount, by contrast, says it wants control of the entire company, including the firm's traditional pay-TV networks, which are seen as a declining business.


Its deal values the entire company at $108.4bn.


Paramount is proposing to pay $30 per share, in an all-cash offer, which it says gives shareholders more certainty than Netflix's plan.


In both cases, the target completion date is many months away.







Why do Paramount and Netflix want Warner Bros?


Warner Bros, which traces its roots back about a century, has a vast library of content, ranging from classics like Looney Tunes and Casablanca to Friends, Superman and Harry Potter. Its HBO division is known for ""prestige"" television, including The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Succession.


But the storied firm has been under pressure as online streaming has disrupted film and television industries.


For Netflix, the streaming industry's biggest player with more than 300 million customers, buying the film and streaming division would bolster its movie offerings, while heading off any potential rivals looking to get their hands on the Warner Bros content.


Paramount, by contrast, is looking for a partner that will give it the scale to compete against industry giants such as Netflix and Disney.




A takeover would build on Mr Ellison's purchase of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio over the summer.


On the streaming side, he is looking to add HBO Max's roughly 120 million streaming customers to Paramount's 79 million.


Analysts say a tie-up could offer benefits to the struggling traditional pay TV networks as well, giving them greater clout in business negotiations and presenting opportunities for cost savings.


Paramount's traditional networks include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central, while Warner Bros would bring CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.




Who is likely to win?


Both deals raise competition concerns and are expected to face scrutiny from regulators in the US and Europe.


Netflix's plan has drawn warnings that it would give the dominant streaming player even more power over actors and screenwriters, while putting further pressure on local cinemas.


But a combined Paramount-Warner Bros would also leave it in control of a significant slice of sports and children's entertainment, raising potential concern for advertisers and local television distributors.


Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.




Analysts said approval would likely hinge on how broadly regulators decide to define the market, and whether players like YouTube are considered part of the competition.


Netflix is relatively new to deal-making.


Some have also suggested that Paramount could be in a stronger position thanks to the relationship between Trump and the Ellison family, including tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Larry Ellison. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is also one of Paramount's financial partners.


But Trump himself has offered little certainty about his views.




Though he has praised the Ellisons in the past, on social media on Monday, he took aim at their ownership of Paramount, triggered by a 60 Minutes interview that the company aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.


Previously, he had noted potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up, given the size of the company, while also praising the streamer's bosses.


How could the deal affect consumers?


It's not clear.


Neither Netflix nor Paramount have offered much insight into how they would incorporate Warner Bros into their current offerings or seize the opportunity to launch new kinds of streaming packages.


When it comes to prices, boosting Netflix's offerings could allow it to charge customers more. But if viewers find they are paying for one streaming service rather than two, it could cost them less.


More than 70% of HBO Max customers in the US also subscribe to Netflix, according to analysts at Raymond James.

Dozens injured after magnitude 7.5 quake strikes northern Japan,"At least 30 people were injured after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit north-eastern Japan on Monday night, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes.




The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen.


Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result.


Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports.


Addressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: ""Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.""




Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency.


The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast.


The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said.


""We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,"" he added.



Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said.


None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency.


Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011.


That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.




This home in Aomori prefecture was among those affected by the earthquake


Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.


It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year.


Earlier this year, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, with worst-case scenarios suggesting it would cause trillions in damage, and potentially kill hundreds of thousands.





Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - have already been responsible for thousands of deaths.

Berekum West rank 10th in HIV/AIDS cases,"The Berekum West District in the Bono Region has been ranked 10th in HIV/AIDS cases, with 60 new infections recorded in 2025, comprising 50 females and 10 males. 




District Public Health Nurse Leticia Adutwuwaa and HIV/AIDS focal person disclosed this at the public awareness creation day as part of the 2025 World AIDS Day at Jinjini in the Berekum West District. 


 He noted that the high number of female cases was attributed to routine screening in the area for pregnant women during antenatal care. 


 She emphasised that the district's relatively low reported cases did not reflect the actual infection rate but rather low testing rates among residents, adding that many people were still hesitant to undergo HIV testing, despite having access to 13 health facilities in the district. 


Health Promotion Officer Emmanuel Kwadwo urged the public to get tested, seek early treatment, and avoid stigma, stating that fear of testing is a major obstacle in combating the disease. 




Berekum West District Chief Executive (DCE) Collins Asomah expressed concern over the growing number of HIV cases among young people and committed to collaborating with the Health Directorate to address the issue. 


 He emphasised public education, stigma reduction, and HIV testing as key strategies to curb the spread of the virus.

Korle Bu surgeon raises alarm over breast cancer surge; calls for more treatment centres nationwide,"A General Surgeon at the Breast Cancer Unit of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Dr Josephine Nsaful, is urging the establishment of additional cancer centres across the country as Ghana battles a rising number of breast cancer cases.




Speaking during the launch of the Dzidula Breast Cancer Foundation in Accra on Sunday, December 8, 2025, Dr Nsaful revealed that the unit currently records about 600 new breast cancer cases each year, placing immense pressure on the facility.


“We see approximately 600 new cases of breast cancer every year, in addition to those already living with the disease. It is quite concerning and alarming. We are overwhelmed by the large number of patients we have to attend to,” she said.


She explained that the increasing patient load—particularly breast cancer cases—has stretched the existing capacity at teaching hospitals, especially Korle Bu, the country’s largest referral centre.


“We have one of the longest clinic days in the surgical department. It will help if we have more cancer centres across the country so that some burden is lifted from teaching hospitals and, more importantly, cancer care becomes accessible to Ghanaians,” she added.




At the same event, breast cancer survivor and founder of the Dzidula Breast Cancer Foundation, Fafa Gozo, highlighted the financial hardships many patients face during treatment.


“I have people in that room who, because of stigmatisation, do not want to be interviewed, but believe you me, they are going through a lot of financial challenges. Their treatment is often interrupted. They go today and tomorrow, and then they have to take a long break, and that doesn’t help them. So we are trying to raise money. The government cannot do it alone,” she said.


The call reinforces the urgent need for expanded cancer infrastructure to improve access and save lives.

Ghanas Dr Richard Owusu Nyarko becomes 1st African fellow of American Professional Wound Care Association,"A Ghanaian medical doctor and academic, Dr Richard Owusu Nyarko, has been named a Fellow of the American Professional Wound Care Association (APWCA), one of the most prestigious professional organisations in the United States comprising physicians, surgeons, clinical educators, and specialised wound-care nurses.




He becomes the first African and the first Ghanaian to attain this distinguished status after meeting all requirements. Dr Owusu Nyarko had served as a Diplomate of the Association in good standing for five years with an unblemished professional record before earning the fellowship title. This accomplishment grants him the legal privilege to use the post-nominal “FAPWCA” professionally and academically worldwide.


PROFILE OF DR. RICHARD OWUSU NYARKO


Dr Owusu Nyarko completed his basic education at Holy Child School in Obuasi, Ashanti Region, passing with distinction in the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE).


He continued to Kumasi Anglican Secondary School (KASS), where he studied General Science, before pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences of the Presbyterian University College, Ghana, on a full scholarship from Knatto Complex Limited.







Motivated to become a medical doctor, he began a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery programme in Ghana and later transitioned into the Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, American International University of West Africa (AIUWA) in The Gambia, with support from Mr Raymond Amedior.


While at AIUWA, he passed the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) USA IFOM 1 & 2 examinations and graduated as Valedictorian, earning distinctions in most of his courses.


In line with Ghana’s requirement for all foreign-trained doctors, he presented his credentials to the Ghana Medical and Dental Council for verification, which successfully authenticated his MD degree. He is also registered and licensed as a medical doctor within the East African Community (EAC).


Dr. Owusu Nyarko received financial support from Mrs Angelina Owusu, a maternal aunt and philanthropist based in Texas, USA, to complete a master’s degree in Health Care Management — a joint programme between Ghana Technology University College (now Ghana Communication Technology University) and Cass Europe, Luxembourg.



Committed to further academic and professional development, he completed a second master’s degree in Clinical Leadership and Management (M.Sc. CLAM) from the University of Ghana. He also holds an Advanced Executive Mastery Certificate in Business Administration and Enterprise Leadership from the Graduate School of Governance and Leadership (GSGL).


He earned his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Health Care Management through a collaborative programme between Ghana Communication Technology University and Cass Europe, France. This degree has been verified and certified by the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC).


Through hard work, perseverance, and dedication, Dr Owusu Nyarko rose from Adjunct Lecturer to Senior Lecturer at Ghana Christian University College (an institution affiliated with the University for Development Studies). He later became the institution’s first qualified Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences.


He currently serves as the Vice President and Head of Academics at Ghana Christian University College.




Beyond his medical practice, he is an accomplished health science researcher with more than 40 peer-reviewed publications in reputable international journals covering Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery, Pharmacology, Public Health, Health Economics, and Health Care Management. His works are accessible on ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and Academia.edu.


INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL MEMBERSHIPS


Dr Owusu Nyarko is the first African and Ghanaian to qualify as both a Diplomate and Fellow of the American Professional Wound Care Association (APWCA). He is also the first African to become a Fellow of the American College of Clinical Wound Specialists (ACCWS).


He is a member of the East African Society of Physiological Sciences (EASPS), which grants him automatic membership in the African Association of Physiological Sciences (AAPS). He is also a professional member of the American Heart Association and the Medical Association of Tanzania (MAT).

Ho Teaching Hospital unveils meditation garden and music therapy studio,"The Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH) has inaugurated a purpose-built Meditation Garden and Music Therapy Studio, marking a significant expansion of its wellness and medical tourism portfolio.




Situated at the HTH Annex in Kpogadzi along the Ho–Aflao road in the Volta Region, the new facility offers a tranquil sanctuary designed to support mental and emotional rejuvenation. 


Through guided meditation and therapeutic music sessions, the centre seeks to reinforce the Hospital’s holistic healthcare model under its evolving Medical Tourism initiative.


The commissioning ceremony drew an esteemed gathering of diplomats, Board members, and senior management of the Hospital, who explored the facility’s immersive healing experience. 


Among the distinguished attendees were Ambassador Jean Natho Dore, Ambassador of Guinea to Ghana; Mr Abdul Aziz Diallo, First Counsellor for Economic Affairs at the Guinea Embassy; H.E. Awoki Panassa, High Commissioner of Togo to Ghana; Amb.

Guests were taken through comprehensive preventive health screenings, guided meditation, physiotherapy exercises, and music therapy sessions facilitated by clinical psychologists.


According to the Hospital, the facility is intended to complement conventional medical treatments by easing stress, reducing anxiety, and enhancing the overall psychological resilience of patients. It will also serve as a wellness retreat for individuals seeking rest and recovery from demanding lifestyles.


The project reflects HTH’s strategic commitment to delivering integrated, patient-centred care that strengthens both physical and mental well-being. 





The Meditation Garden and Music Therapy Studio are expected to become a defining feature of the Hospital’s therapeutic landscape.



H.E. Awoki Panassa, who also serves as Dean of the diplomatic corps, praised the initiative as “an experience worth undertaking” and urged the public to utilise the centre’s offerings.


Representing the Chief Executive Officer, the Director of Human Resources, Mr Edmund Tsogbe, reiterated the Hospital’s aspiration to establish itself as Ghana’s leading medical tourism destination.


Mr Anthony Bells Kafui Kanyi, Medical Tourism Coordinator, revealed that the Hospital will introduce quarterly wellness retreats from next year, targeting both corporate groups and individual clients.

Legal Green Association launches scholarship scheme for law students,"The Legal Green Association (LGA) has launched a scholarship scheme aimed at supporting financially disadvantaged students at the Ghana School of Law.




The launch took place on Sunday, 7th December, 2025, at Maison Français, University of Ghana.


The event drew participants from the legal community, public service, and governance circles.


In her opening remarks, the LGA General Secretary, Emerentiana W. Alatinga, described the scheme as an important step for the Association, noting that its purpose is to give financially deprived students better access to legal education.


She expressed appreciation to individuals and groups who have supported the initiative.




The Founding Leader of the LGA and current CEO of Tema Oil Refinery, Edmond Kombat, Esq., commended the Association’s leadership for implementing the scheme.


He shared experiences from his own time at the Ghana School of Law and encouraged the LGA to ensure transparency and accountability in managing the fund.


Richard Nunekpeku, Esq., Deputy CEO of Goldbod, welcomed the initiative and urged students to pursue their ambitions with discipline and determination.


A Technical Advisor to the Commissioner-General of the GRA, Mrs Elsie Appau-Klu, Esq., described education and youth development as important long-term investments and urged responsible management of the scholarship fund.



A past leader of the LGA, Kabu Nartey, also acknowledged the efforts of the current administration in formalising the scheme.


He expressed gratitude to senior lawyers, including Edmond Kombat, Mr Edudzi Tamekloe, and Sammy Gyamfi, for their support during his tenure.


Abdul Fatah Maigah Mahama, Deputy Director-General of TVET, noted that many law students struggle financially and said the scheme would offer timely support.


Delivering the main address, Festus Matey traced the Association’s development since its formation in 2022.




He highlighted the LGA’s advocacy for the inclusion of professional law students in the Student Loan Trust Fund and ongoing efforts to secure pupillage placements with the Attorney-General’s Office, law firms, and public-sector legal departments.


He noted that the Attorney-General has offered internship opportunities for LGA members.


Matey described the scholarship scheme as the centrepiece of the LGA’s current initiatives, explaining that it aims to expand access, provide financial support, and strengthen mentorship for committed students.


In closing, Evans Mawunyo Tsikata, Head of Politics for the LGA, said the scholarship scheme aligns with the Association’s goal of ensuring that members are not deprived of legal education due to financial constraints.




He encouraged new members to uphold the Association’s values and said the LGA would continue working with state agencies, law firms, the SRC, and other partners to broaden professional opportunities for students.

Alumni support essential to educational progress  Former MoE Chief Director,"A former Chief Director of the Ministry of Education (MoE), Enoch H. Cobbinah, has charged old students of secondary cycle institutions to work together as partners of development in Ghana's educational sector.




According to him, this has become necessary to catch up with global evolutions that are changing the face of education and training.


Speaking as Chairman on the occasion of the 116th Anniversary and Homecoming of the Ghana Secondary Technical School over the weekend, he indicated the importance of the partnership because the government cannot do it alone.


""The task ahead is enormous, but so should our collective commitment to the continued progress of GSTS and Ghana be. To alumni associations, the community and potential partners, we cannot rely on the government alone to make GSTS great. That is why we shall continue to count on you to do more through mentorship, financial and other forms of contributions.""





Mr Cobbinah, an old student of the school, described the results of efforts to support it as a renaissance that will turn things around.




""This renaissance would mean supporting a new bold vision to rekindle and deepen science and technical education. That enables us, in collaboration with key stakeholders and partners, to nurture a pipeline of future-ready students with practical skills and competencies required to plug into the 4th industrial revolution technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, robotics and so on,"" he said.





He was speaking on the theme ""Advancing Educational Excellence, 116 Years of GSTS Impact and Growth in Ghana"".


Also speaking at the event, headmaster of the school, Rev. Dr Kennedy Obeng, called for a conscious investment into modern facilities to help build students who can contribute immensely to the development of Ghana and the world at large.


He also called on the government to do its part in reaching targets set in line with modern global standards like STEM.



""We've heard the vision of government vis-à-vis our development aspiration. There should be conscious investment and provision of infrastructure and resources in modern classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and to provide a conducive learning environment.""


""There is also the need for us to have access to technology such as computers and internet connectivity to enhance digital teaching and learning. Resources such as the provision of modern classrooms, libraries and laboratories are important,"" he stated.


As part of activities to mark its 116 years of existence, new executives for the Ghana Global GSTS Alumni Association were inducted into office to spearhead affairs for the next four years.





The new leadership is headed by Daniel Teye,, who is widely known for his architectural mastery in projects like the Aqua Safari and Safari Valley Resorts.

Dzodze-Penyi SHS Headmaster threatened me for refusing an abortion  Victim alleges,"A final-year student at Dzodze-Penyi Senior High School in the Volta Region has accused Headmaster Joshua Vidzro of sexual abuse and impregnating her, revealing that he threatened her life for refusing to terminate the pregnancy.




The student claims the headmaster told her to take specific actions regarding the pregnancy or face serious consequences.


In an audio recording intercepted by Citi News, the alleged victim is heard informing the headmaster of the pregnancy. 


In a separate interview on Fafa FM in Dzodze, she recounted accompanying the headmaster and another woman to take a sick colleague to the hospital. 


On the return trip, the other woman parted ways with them, leaving her alone with the headmaster.




According to the student, the headmaster bought her food and later took her to an apartment he claimed was his, where the alleged misconduct occurred.


“After eating, I wanted to dispose of the pack, and he directed me to the kitchen. When I came back, he locked the door and threw the keys away and carried me to the bedroom. All this while I was shouting. He started removing my clothes and forced himself on me. After he sent me back to school.”

“I started to feel unwell last week, so I went to the hospital for some tests, and I was confirmed positive. I informed him, and he threatened me, saying if I can’t terminate the pregnancy, then he will kill me,” she alleged.


Meanwhile, another student, aged 14, has reportedly made similar allegations. In response to these allegations, the Ghana Education Service (GES) in the Volta Region has directed Mr. Vidzro to step aside immediately.



He has been instructed to hand over all official duties, records, and school property to the Municipal Director of Education for Ketu North and to avoid contact with the affected students while investigations are ongoing. 


The Municipal Director has assumed temporary administration of the school.


GES and the Ministry of Education emphasize that the safety and welfare of students are a top priority, and all allegations of misconduct will be thoroughly investigated. Updates on the investigation will be provided as the matter progresses.

This is the real picture  Dr Kpikpi says WASSCE results exposes long-standing decline,"The 2024 Presidential Candidate of the Progressive Alliance of Ghana (PAG), Dr John Kpikpi, says this year’s poor WASSCE results reflect the true state of the education system after years of examination malpractice masked the real performance of students.




Speaking on Metro TV’s Good Afternoon Ghana, he said the latest outcomes, which have triggered a national debate, should not surprise anyone familiar with the entrenched malpractices in many schools. 


He argued that Ghana has for years been “misled” into believing students were performing better than they actually were.


According to him, many parents knowingly pay illegal fees, while some teachers and school authorities work with invigilators to influence exam outcomes. 


He said such unethical practices have become so widespread that they have created a false sense of academic achievement.




Dr Kpikpi commended the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) for what appears to be a renewed clampdown on cheating this year, which he believes has exposed the real picture of student performance.


He urged stakeholders not to focus solely on the drop in results but to confront the uncomfortable truths revealed by stricter supervision. 


He said the nation must use this as a turning point to fix deeper problems in the education sector.


“I wonder whether these results we’ve seen now are actually the real results that we shall be receiving all these years, but they have been masked by serious exam malpractice, which is entrenched and practised across this country. 



""In most schools, parents happily pay money, and schools receive money from parents to buy invigilators. In fact, it has become the norm. 


""It looks like this year WAEC found a way to dig in and tackle all of these, and the result is what is coming out without the mask on it,” he said.

Investment in data production strengthens governance  Deputy Finance Minister,"Deputy Minister of Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, has underscored the importance of investing in quality data to strengthen good governance.




“We know that when we invest in data, we improve the quality of public expenditure, we empower citizens, we energise innovation, and we create opportunities for equitable and inclusive development,” he said.


The Deputy Minister said this at the inaugural 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users, and Enhancers, which also serves to commemorate the 2025 African Statistics Day.


The programme was on the theme: “Financing Innovations in Data and Statistics for Sustainable and Inclusive Development.”


 He said the country was moving from donor-reliant




financing arrangements toward a model grounded in national ownership and sustainable investment.


“I am proud to note that the 2026 budget allocates GH¢207 million to advance critical operations including rebasing GDP and CPI, completing key national surveys, and strengthening economic performance and price measurement,” he said.


The budget, he stressed, also supported the scaling of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Growth (MIEG), placing Ghana among a select group of countries using near-real-time data to manage the economy.


 This tool will enable policy responses up to 10 weeks faster than traditional quarterly estimates.



Mr Ampem said a major reform was the integration of administrative data systems using the Ghana Card’s unique identifier.


This innovation, explained, was projected to cut future census costs by over 70 per cent, while delivering continuous, high-quality population and sectoral data.


He said another transformative measure was the launch of Ghana in Numbers, a new annual, visual, globally benchmarked data publication designed to turn statistics into compelling narratives for the public and policymakers.


To reinforce this ecosystem, he said, the government was reviewing the Statistical Service Act to further strengthen the independence, authority, and global standing of the service.




He said without quality data, planning becomes speculative, policymaking becomes inefficient, and development outcomes become uneven.


“Data drives smarter investments. It ensures that public resources are directed where they are needed most,” he said.


He stated that Ghana had made remarkable strides in modernizing its statistical landscape.


“We delivered West Africa’s first fully digital Population and Housing Census, processing data three times faster than previous cycles.




“We have institutionalised the high‑frequency surveys that provide real‑time insights into welfare, labour market trends and business dynamics,” he said.


Dr Alhassan Iddrisu, the Government Statistician, said the theme reaffirmed that “nation becomes


what it measures, what it funds, and what it chooses to understand.”


“When we produce data well, fund it sustainably, and use it consistently, we strengthen institutions, protect the vulnerable, and open opportunities for every community,” he said.




Dr Wilfred Ochan, Co- Chair, GSSDP Group, said the forum showed the commitment of GSS to achieve its mandate of producing quality data.


He called for investment in the production of data, saying, “Data on its own is not informative unless it is credible, accessible, and put to good use.”

High Court ruling on Kpandai will stand unless overturned by Supreme Court- Berekum West MP,"The Member of Parliament for Berekum West, Dickson Kyere-Duah, says the decision by Parliament to notify the Electoral Commission (EC) of a vacancy in the Kpandai Constituency is simply a constitutional requirement and will remain in force unless a higher court reverses the ruling.




Speaking on the AM Show, he explained that the High Court’s decision ordering a re-run of the 2024 parliamentary election in Kpandai must be respected by all parties, including Parliament and the EC.


“This does not stop my brother Matthew Nyindam from pursuing his case at the Supreme Court,” he said. “If the verdict of the High Court is overturned at any point, it will stop the EC from proceeding to conduct the election. So for me, nothing new has happened.”


Kyere-Duah stressed that Parliament was only communicating the court’s directive to the EC, as mandated by law. He noted that if the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal delivers a contrary ruling, Parliament will similarly implement it without hesitation.


“A court decision will be respected by everybody,” he said, adding that “in the same vein, if an appeal court overturns the decision, the same will be implemented by Parliament.”




His comments come after the Parliamentary Service formally informed the EC of a vacancy in the Kpandai seat. 


The notification, dated 4 December 2025 and signed by the Clerk to Parliament, Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror, signals the official start of processes to conduct a re-run election.


The letter was issued in line with Article 112(5) of the 1992 Constitution, which requires the Clerk to Parliament to notify the EC whenever a parliamentary seat becomes vacant.


The re-run is expected to determine who ultimately represents the people of Kpandai in Parliament, following the annulment of the 2024 parliamentary election results in that constituency

"Ghanas public debate too emotional, not driven by data  Prof Bokpin","Economics professor Godfred Bokpin has criticised the quality of Ghana’s national conversations, arguing that far too many public debates are shaped by emotion rather than evidence. He says the country must urgently elevate the role of data in public policy, decision-making and everyday discourse.




Speaking at the 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users and Enhancers, Prof. Bokpin stressed that reliable data remains the single most important input for sound governance and economic management. According to him, countries can function without natural resources, but no nation can progress without solid data.


“As an academic, I value data more than gold or oil. Without data, nothing gets done. That is how important it is,” he told participants during a panel discussion.


He also noted that although the Ghana Statistical Service produces a wealth of information every year, much of it is ignored or underutilised. He urged policymakers, businesses and the public to integrate this data into planning, monitoring and evaluation processes.


“There is so much data harvested by the Statistical Service, yet many people think they only produce GDP figures,” he said. “The real question is: how often do we rely on data in our daily lives? How data-driven are we?”




Prof. Bokpin lamented that national discussions frequently resemble talk shows rather than evidence-based exchanges. He argued that greater reliance on data would reduce disputes on media platforms and temper emotionally charged debates.


“If we were driven by data as a country, there would be fewer disagreements, less emotion and probably fewer fights, because data simply speaks for itself,” he added.

Arthur Kennedy writes on President Kufuor,"Four score and 7 years ago, a child was born. He has been very consequential to Ghana, Africa and the world.




I read biographies a lot so even though I had interacted with President Kufuor quite a bit, I looked for a biography. From that, I learned that he had been an exceptional student at Prempeh College, where according to his biography, he picked up virtually every prize in sight.


After returning to Ghana after his education in UK, he joined politics at a young age. He served under Busia and Rawlings but his masterpiece, on the way to the Presidency, was his 1996 campaign, repeated in 1998.


He was under-resourced but he made up for his lack of resources with hard work and personal relations.


Indeed, it was Northerners who propelled him to victory in his primary campaigns. In 2007, during my ill-fated campaign, in home after home in the north, they showed me the beds or cots he slept on and recounted stories of midnight knocks on doors by Kufuor.




As President, he was humble and inclusive. A humble Ashanti! As he once said, ""Every party has factions and leaders must accommodate them"".


Wherever he went as President, doors opened, to him and for Ghana. And he strengthened institutions with good quality appointments. But his finest season may have been in his post-presidency.


He has been dignified, statesmanlike-- maybe a tad too quiet, formed a foundation and helped to establish APIMI. As he explained last September at a forum, public interest digital media combined with AI will bring Africa to the centre of global development.


Together with President Mahama, the Oldman will help give us and the youth the tools to keep Ghana as the gateway to Africa through this century.



Mr President, as they sing ""Di wo hene"" and you twirl around a bit, remember our last conversation and speak out more. And if Delay proposes, turn her down!


May God bless you with many more years of joy and health. Happy birthday!

IMANI files RTI request seeking details on new nationwide SIM registration,"Policy think tank IMANI Africa has filed a Right to Information (RTI) request seeking full disclosure on the government’s planned nationwide SIM registration exercise set to begin in early 2026. The group says the move is necessary to ensure transparency, legality, and data protection ahead of the rollout.




In a request submitted on Monday, December 8, 2025, to the Ministry of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, IMANI asked for documents covering the legal basis of the new registration regime, technical design, biometric verification systems, procurement records, and oversight arrangements. The request was received by the Minister’s secretary, the think tank confirmed.


IMANI said Ghanaians deserve clarity on how their biometric data will be collected, stored, and protected under the new system. It also raised concerns about governance, cost implications, and the role of private sector vendors expected to participate in the exercise.


The think tank cited Article 21(1)(f) of the 1992 Constitution and the Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), which guarantees public access to information held by state institutions. It said its request aligns with efforts “to promote accountability and ensure that the exercise is conducted in the public interest.”


IMANI’s submission asked the ministry to disclose the legal instruments authorising the new SIM registry, the architecture of the verification process, details of vendors selected, and any agreements governing the management of citizens’ data.




According to IMANI, the RTI application is a proactive step to safeguard transparency and protect user rights before the exercise begins. The think tank added that public trust depends on clear assurances that data-sharing protocols and privacy safeguards meet national and international standards.

"Bawumia will perform better in 2026 NPP primaries, his popularity has actually risen  Nana Akomea","Vice Chairman of the ‘Bawumia 2024 Campaign Team,’ Nana Akomea, says he is convinced that Dr Mahamudu Bawumia will record an even stronger performance in the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) upcoming presidential primaries than he did in 2023.




In an interview on Citi FM on Monday, December 8, Akomea argued that Dr Bawumia’s appeal within the party has grown significantly — and notably, without the influence of incumbency this time around.


He maintained that this expanded support base puts the former Vice President in a favourable position ahead of the January polls.


“Bawumia’s popularity has actually risen without incumbency, and that is why I keep saying he will do better than he did in 2023. It’s just a month away — you will see,” Akomea stated confidently.


The NPP will elect its presidential candidate on January 31, 2026. Dr Bawumia is one of five aspirants seeking to lead the party into the next general election.




The other contenders are former Assin Central MP Kennedy Agyapong, former Agriculture Minister Dr Bryan Acheampong, former Education Minister Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum, and former NPP General Secretary Kwabena Agyepong.

Ghana Education crisis deepens as WASSCE Results expose systemic gaps,"The provisional 2025 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) results, released by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), confront Ghana with a deepening crisis in secondary education. The catastrophic decline in core subjects, especially Core Mathematics and Social Studies, signals a failure to equip nearly half a million candidates with foundational knowledge. Only 48.73% of candidates achieved the minimum A1-C6 passes in Core Mathematics. These results confirm one of the poorest national performances recorded recently.




Catastrophic Core Subject Collapse


The data shows an alarming ""Great Collapse."" The outright fail rate (Grade F9) in Core Mathematics nearly quadrupled, skyrocketing from 6.10% in 2024 to 26.77% in 2025. Chillingly, ""nearly one out of every four students who sat for the exam failed the subject outright."" Similarly, the F9 rate for Social Studies almost tripled, jumping from 9.55% to 27.50%. Failure rates in English Language and Integrated Science also more than doubled.


This massive surge in failures is linked to a stunning fall in the crucial A1-C6 pass rate. Core Mathematics, the linchpin for many tertiary courses, saw its pass rate collapse by almost 18 percentage points. It plunged from 66.86% in 2024 to just 48.73% in 2025. The implications are stark: ""more than half of the candidates did not secure the grades required for tertiary admission."" The futures of 461,736 candidates are now in jeopardy.


Voices from the Classroom and Home




These numbers translate into real-life heartbreak. A female Senior High School student, speaking anonymously, attributed the lack of focus to the Free SHS policy. She admitted, ""The free SHS also contributes to the failure of the students."" She noted a lack of financial accountability meant students ""will not take his studies seriously.""


Educationist Professor Stephen Adei offered a critical diagnosis. He argued that the challenge's true source is at the basic school level. ""The main source of the problem happens at the basic school level before the secondary school,"" he stated. He cautioned that Ghana is ""almost producing illiterate people at the basic level,"" and warned, ""Unless we tackle a fundamental issue... these results will be the best we can hope for.""


The Ghana Education Service (GES), through its Public Relations Officer, Daniel Fenyi, offered a crucial, nuanced response. While confirming the 2025 results ""represent a true and credible reflection of students' academic performance"" and affirming close collaboration with WAEC in conducting the exams, Fenyi also admitted the severity of the decline was deeply concerning for the education system. He stated, for any genuine education system, ""this result is quite worrying,"" but stressed that the results are truly reflective of student capabilities: ""the results you see are a true reflection of the competencies of our learners.""


WAEC attributes Failure to Core Skill Gaps



John Kapi, WAEC's Head of Public Relations, provided insight into the failures on the JOY Super Morning Show. He stressed the decline ""does not reflect a deviation from the curriculum."" Instead, it ""indicates the need for strengthened teaching and student focus on practical problem-solving skills.""


Mr. Kapi detailed seven specific areas of Core Mathematics weakness. These included the inability to solve simple interest applications, translate word problems, and represent information in diagrams. He confirmed these topics were within the syllabus. Beyond mathematics, WAEC flagged a pervasive issue: candidates' reliance on ""social media diction and non-standard English"" in their answers. This revealed a broad decline in formal academic communication skills.


Political Fallout: Blame and Historical Context


The sharp decline has quickly become a political flashpoint. The Minority in Parliament issued a strong statement criticizing the current government's handling of the sector and the GES's official response. The caucus highlighted the dramatic drop in Core Mathematics from 66.86% in 2024 to 48.73% in 2025, which followed a period of ""consistent improvement from 2022 to 2024."" They contrasted the 2025 results with the much lower performance in 2016 (e.g., Core Mathematics at 33.12%), arguing that the previous government had successfully improved learning outcomes.




The Minority also directly challenged the GES's attempt to attribute the poor performance partly to enhanced invigilation, describing the explanation as ""unprofessional and unethical."" The caucus questioned, ""Could it be a reason for the poor performance?"" They stressed that while invigilation must protect integrity, it ""should not, and must not put fear in the candidates"" as this can negatively affect performance.


Systemic Context: Infrastructure and Free SHS


While WAEC focuses on student skills, analysts point to systemic flaws. Cletus Seidu Dapilah, Member of Parliament for Jirapa, cited ""inadequate and uneven distribution of teachers across basic schools."" He noted that weak foundations lead to poor secondary school performance.


Experts demand a data-driven approach. Dr. Peter Anti Partey, Executive Director of IFEST, urged an end to assumptions. He stressed, ""We should ask the Ministry of Education to let us know which schools are pulling the national averages down."" He asked what interventions the ministry would provide.




The Free SHS policy is widely debated. While increasing enrollment, stakeholders cite overstretched school resources and overworking of teachers. They also note reduced student motivation due to a lack of parental financial investment.


Universities hold the Line on Admission Standards


The University of Ghana signaled that academic rigor will not be compromised. Prof. Gordon Awandare, the Pro Vice Chancellor, stated the university ""will not lower its admission cut-off points for the 2025/2026 academic year.""


Prof. Awandare explained the rationale. ""At the University of Ghana, every year, we have many more students making the cut-off but not getting the opportunity to be admitted,"" he said, citing limited space. He stressed that standards cannot be compromised. The message to struggling students is difficult: ""We will advise that if they really want to come to Legon, they should resit some of the papers and improve their aggregates and try again.""




Integrity Crisis Tarnishes Results Release


The academic slump was worsened by a severe ""integrity crisis."" The provisional results were marred by an unprecedented crackdown on malpractice. The Ghana Examinations Committee approved severe sanctions against thousands of students and dozens of personnel.


Specifically, 6,295 candidates had subject results annulled for bringing unauthorized materials. The entire results of 653 candidates were canceled for possessing mobile phones. A deeper rot was revealed. Results for candidates from 185 schools were withheld for suspected collusion.


Most damning is the criminal involvement. A total of 35 persons, including 19 teachers, faced legal action. WAEC confirmed that 19 of those individuals have already been arraigned before court and convicted to fines or prison terms. This sent a strong message against complicity. The convicted teachers' names will be given to the Ghana Education Service for further disciplinary action.




Moving Forward: A Call for Urgent Reform


The 2025 WASSCE results are an unavoidable indictment of Ghana's secondary education. The findings show a significant disconnect between teaching methods and the practical skills required for success. The dual crises—high failure rates and widespread malpractice—demand an urgent national response.


For Ghana, striving to build a skilled workforce, the fact that most high school graduates are deemed unfit for university raises fundamental questions about national development. Educational stakeholders must use this sobering data. The challenge is to implement measurable reforms, bridge the critical skills gap, and restore trust in the examination process.

"NAIMOS ramps up Eastern Region clampdown, shuts major galamsey sites on Akyem Oda stretch","The National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) has reinforced its relentless offensive against illegal mining, completing another high-impact operation across the Eastern Region on Sunday, 8 December 2025.




The latest sweep, which spanned more than 12 hours, underscored government’s growing determination to halt the destruction of forest reserves and water bodies.


From dawn until late evening, NAIMOS operatives conducted coordinated patrols in the Atiwa West District and the Birim Central Municipality—two areas increasingly plagued by persistent galamsey activity.


During the mission, the task force discovered several active illegal mining sites and moved swiftly to neutralise the machinery driving the devastation.


A major breakthrough occurred along the Akyem Akropong corridor, where officials uncovered an extensive roadside mining enclave hosting four excavators and five washing plants.




Two of the excavators were found fully operational, prompting officers to remove their monitors and control units on the spot to render them unusable. The remaining two machines had already been partially stripped by illegal miners attempting to evade detection.


At approximately 16:10 hours, a second discovery was made in Akyem Oda within Birim Central. There, the task force disabled another excavator stationed directly beside the main road.


In total, three excavators were fully immobilised across both locations. The machines were left on-site, as the operation could not secure low-bed transport for evacuation.


Environmental assessments conducted during the raid painted a grim picture. Vast portions of land—estimated at more than four acres—had been scarred by deep, contaminated pits.



Some of the water-filled craters stretched as wide as 200 metres and sank about eight feet deep, posing immediate dangers to nearby streams, farmlands and residents.


NAIMOS intelligence suggests that illegal miners continue to adapt their tactics, often withdrawing briefly during enforcement activities and repositioning equipment only a short distance away.


This pattern, according to officials, reinforces the need for sustained pressure rather than isolated raids.


Nonetheless, NAIMOS reports that its stepped-up visibility and rapid mobilisation strategy are rattling galamsey operators across the region.




Many miners are said to be abandoning sites mid-operation, interrupting supply chains and weakening the networks that facilitate illegal gold production.


The Secretariat maintains that its work is far from complete. With critical rivers such as the Birim and Ayensu still heavily threatened, NAIMOS says prolonged field deployment remains essential.


It has reiterated that illegal mining is not only an attack on the environment but a severe public health hazard, contaminating food and water sources with dangerous chemicals.

Prof. H. Kwasi Prempeh urges constitutional overhaul to fix OSP challenges,"Executive Director of the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Prof Henry Kwasi Prempeh, is urging a full constitutional review to resolve the persistent controversies surrounding the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), warning that incremental fixes will not save the institution.




Speaking on Monday, December 8, Prof Prempeh stressed that the impasse facing the OSP goes beyond administrative shortcomings and requires a deeper structural intervention.


According to him, attempts to patch the system through minor reforms or extended court battles will only delay an inevitable collapse.


“The problem we’re facing now calls for a constitutional solution. Basically, that is how we can resolve this impasse,” he said, cautioning that the OSP could eventually fade into irrelevance if fundamental issues are not addressed.


He added that renewing the institution’s legal foundation would offer a more permanent fix than trying to “renovate around the problem,” noting that other countries have successfully redesigned their anti-corruption architecture and Ghana can do the same.




“If we’re serious about solving the problem, there’s no shortage of innovative ideas to deal with it. There are comparative models around; we can innovate our own,” he remarked in an interview on Channel One TV, urging policymakers to consider bold and transformative reforms.

"NYA CEO Osman Ayariga highlights need for skilled, disciplined Yango couriers at 2025 Conference","The CEO of the National Youth Authority (NYA), Osman Ayariga, has praised Yango Ghana for its growing role in transforming youth employment in the country.




He described the company as “a functioning public–private development mechanism” rather than merely a transport platform.


Speaking at the 2025 Yango Partner Conference, Mr Osman Ayariga commended the ride-hailing and delivery service for creating opportunities that align with Ghana’s national youth development agenda.


The event brought together Ningo-Prampram MP, Samuel Nartey George, Yango Ghana Country Manager Emmanuel Koduah, government representatives, partners, riders, drivers, and stakeholders from across the digital mobility ecosystem.





Reaffirming the mandate of the NYA under Act 939, Mr Osman Ayariga noted that 2025 has been declared a year of “Heightened Youth Engagement and Economic Activation.” 




He highlighted major initiatives—including the nationwide Youth Conference themed “Igniting Potential; Inspiring Change” and the National Apprenticeship Programme targeting 10,000 young people this year and scaling up to 100,000 by 2026.


“These are not symbolic actions,” he emphasised. “We are building structural solutions to unemployment through technical, digital, and entrepreneurial training.”


Positioning Yango as a central player in youth economic empowerment, Mr Osman Ayariga outlined three pillars behind the platform’s effectiveness:


• Technology & Access: Digitisation of transport and courier services previously dominated by the informal sector.• Local Enterprise Growth: Strengthening MSMEs operating in transport and logistics.• Youth Employment: With over 70% of riders and drivers under age 35, Yango has become a gateway to income, financial identity, discipline, and business skills.



“For many young people, Yango is a classroom on wheels,” he said. “It teaches time management, customer service, accountability, and entrepreneurship.”





Mr Osman Ayariga reiterated government’s commitment to modernising the transport sector, especially the commercial motorcycle and tricycle industry. 


He confirmed that the state is finalising a regulatory framework to legalise and formalise okada and pragyia operations.


The policy will require riders to be at least 21 years old, acquire commercial licenses, undergo mandatory training, operate from designated stations, and meet strict safety requirements, including certified helmets with identification numbers.




He noted that beyond transportation, Yango’s delivery services now support Ghana’s expanding e-commerce sector, enabling restaurants, online sellers, and small businesses—many youth-led—to scale operations.


The NYA CEO emphasised that government’s goal extends beyond job creation and aims to build youth-owned enterprises.


“We don’t want young people to remain riders forever,” Mr Osman Ayariga said. 


“We want them to own fleets, build courier companies, and grow logistics businesses. Yango’s top-performing partners already demonstrate that this pathway is possible.”




To advance this shared mission, Mr. Osman Ayariga, announced the Authority’s readiness to collaborate with Yango on Advanced rider and driver training, Entrepreneurship and financial literacy and Access to credit and asset financing for high-potential partners. 





“Our mission is simple,” he stated. “Every hardworking young Ghanaian deserves a pathway to dignity, stability, and long-term economic growth.”


He concluded by commending Yango’s leadership and encouraging the platform’s riders, drivers, and partners to remain dedicated to building Ghana’s digital future.


“You are not just transporting people and parcels—you are carrying this nation into its digital future,” Mr Osman Ayariga said.




“May God bless your efforts. May God bless Yango. And may God bless the youth and the Republic of Ghana.”

"Ace Ankomah calls for merger of OSP, DPP, and EOCO to build a truly independent prosecution system","Private legal practitioner Ace Anan Ankomah has outlined a set of reforms he believes are necessary to secure the independence and effectiveness of Ghana’s anti-corruption framework.




He is proposing that the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), and the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) be consolidated into a single, autonomous prosecutorial authority.


His comments come as public and parliamentary debate intensifies over whether the OSP should be abolished or restructured.


Speaking on Channel One TV on Monday, December 8, Mr Ankomah said the ongoing controversy should be a catalyst for a broader overhaul of the country’s prosecutorial architecture.


He called for a constitutional review of Article 88(3) and (4), which anchor prosecutorial powers within the Attorney-General’s office, arguing that the system has struggled to deliver justice in complex corruption and economic crime cases.




“In my view, Parliament passing the OSP Act is the biggest concession that, when it comes to corruption and corruption-related offences, the AG’s office has not done well,” he said.


Mr Ankomah noted that economic and financial crimes require specialised expertise and that accused persons often mount strong, technical legal defences that the current system is not well-equipped to handle.


To remedy this, he recommended marrying the anti-corruption drive behind the OSP’s creation with the institutional stability offered by the DPP, while drawing on EOCO’s investigative capacity.


This, he argued, would form a single, politically insulated entity capable of handling high-stakes criminal prosecutions.



“We cannot trust any government with criminal prosecutions because we see that it favours their friends,” he stressed, adding that only a fully independent authority would command public confidence and deliver justice impartially.

KIC Fellow wins National Best Youth Farmer award,"Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC) has celebrated the remarkable achievement of Robben Asare, a KIC Fellow (2019), who has emerged as the National Best Youth Farmer Award winner at the 2025 National Farmers’ Day Celebration




After participating in the KIC program in 2019, the Fellow was inspired by the training, mentorship, and business development support received through KIC. 


This foundation ignited his journey into large-scale plantation farming, with a key focus on rice, mango, and other crop production.


Through consistent mentorship, direction, and the practical agribusiness training model of KIC, he has transformed his vision into a thriving agricultural enterprise. 





His dedication to sustainable farming practices has also earned him the Best Agroforestry Award in 2019, further cementing his place as a leading young agripreneur in Ghana.




This achievement is a clear demonstration of KIC’s long-term impact in equipping young people with the right skills, knowledge, and support systems to succeed in agriculture. 


It reflects how KIC’s fellowship and youth-centred programs empower young innovators to move from learning to large-scale production and national recognition.


KIC congratulates this outstanding Fellow for making the nation proud and continues to celebrate all young people who are redefining agriculture through innovation, resilience, and purpose.

"Nana Akomea refutes claims of selling STC land, says allegations are politically driven","Former Managing Director of the State Transport Company (STC), Nana Akomea, has strongly denied allegations that he sold off portions of the company’s land during his time in office, describing the claims as baseless and politically motivated.




Speaking on Citi FM on Monday, December 8, 2025, Mr Akomea said no STC property was disposed of under his watch, insisting that those seeking to associate him with any land transactions were peddling falsehoods.


According to him, it was rather the National Democratic Congress (NDC) administration that engaged in the sale of STC lands more than a decade ago when the company was struggling financially.


He recalled that around 2010, approximately four acres of STC land in Takoradi were sold to Melcom, and that even the Managing Director’s official residence at Ridge was disposed of, forcing him to secure private accommodation when he later assumed office.


“They are accusing the wrong person. The only government that sold STC land was the NDC. They offloaded about four acres in Takoradi to Melcom. They even sold the MD’s bungalow at Ridge, so when I became MD, I had to find my own place,” Akomea explained. “I haven’t sold even a single foot of STC land.”




He added that another portion of land near the STC headquarters was sold to a company called BCL long before he took over leadership.


Mr Akomea maintained that the accusations against him were misleading and urged the public not to be swayed by politically charged narratives.

TUC slams PURC over premature and disrespectful tariff announcement,"Vice Chair of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), Dr Ken Tweneboa Kodua, has taken strong exception to the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission’s (PURC) decision to announce new electricity and water tariffs without concluding discussions with organised labour.




Speaking on Citi FM on Monday, December 8, Dr Kodua said the move disregarded the ongoing consultation process, which he said was aimed at reaching a tariff structure that workers could understand and accept.


According to him, the sudden announcement raises serious concerns about PURC’s commitment to fairness and transparent engagement.


He noted that the TUC had been collaborating with the Commission to develop a realistic tariff proposal, only for the process to be abruptly abandoned.


Such actions, he warned, risk damaging the trust required for effective cooperation between the parties.




“The procedure was not fully followed. We were working together to design a fair and realistic tariff that we could defend to our members. That process was cut short, and then the new tariffs were announced,” Dr Kodua said.


He added that PURC must explain why it chose to bypass the consultative path it initiated. “That decision was not respectful and does not reflect fairness in our partnership.


PURC started the engagement with TUC, so why they halted the process and went ahead with the announcement needs to be addressed,” he stressed.

Parliament has long struggled to accept truly independent oversight bodies  Ace Ankomah,"Private legal practitioner Ace Ankomah has argued that Ghana’s Parliament has consistently shown discomfort with independent state institutions, especially when those bodies begin to fully exercise their constitutional mandates.




His remarks come amid renewed calls from Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga and some MPs for the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) to be scrapped, with the suggestion that the Attorney-General should assume responsibility for all corruption investigations and prosecutions.


Mr Ayariga, speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, December 3, questioned the rationale behind significant budget allocations to the OSP when, in his view, the Attorney-General’s Department remains under-resourced.


Offering his take on the development during an interview on Channel One TV on Monday, December 8, Mr Ankomah said the tension surrounding the OSP is reflective of a deeper and longstanding pattern.


According to him, Parliament has often resisted institutions that operate independently of its influence.




“Parliament has a great aversion to all the independent institutions, even those set up by the Constitution,” he asserted, pointing to the Auditor-General’s Office as a key example.


He recalled that it took a legal battle to compel the Auditor-General to use its constitutional powers of disallowance and surcharge—tools that were left dormant for years after the 1992 Constitution came into force.


Once activated, he noted, those powers enabled the Auditor-General to recover roughly GH¢65 million for the state, citing World Bank figures.


Mr Ankomah further referenced subsequent developments that, in his view, undermined the Auditor-General’s independence, including parliamentary manoeuvres aimed at reversing Supreme Court rulings that strengthened the office.



He also highlighted the controversial early retirement of former Auditor-General Daniel Domelevo, which he suggested weakened the institution’s effectiveness.

Legal challenge against Wesley Girls High School forces Ghana Supreme Court to define boundaries of religious liberty,"The lawsuit against Wesley Girls Senior High School (SHS) in Ghana is a pivotal Supreme Court case. It challenges the boundaries of religious freedom and institutional rights under Ghana's 1992 Constitution. The central legal question is whether a school, founded on Christian principles by the Methodist Church and substantially state-funded, can restrict the religious practices of its minority Muslim students. This conflict occurs in a national context where 71.3% of the population is Christian and 19.9% is Muslim, highlighting the significance of minority accommodation.




 


Genesis of the Case and Core Claims


The controversy began when Wesley Girls SHS authorities allegedly denied Muslim students the right to fast during Ramadan. Private legal practitioner Shafic Osman filed the suit on December 24, 2024, invoking the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. The Plaintiff argues that restrictions on practices like wearing the hijab and fasting violate constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, specifically Article 21(1)(c) of the 1992 Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to practice any religion.


The Defendants are the Board of Directors of Wesley Girls SHS and the Ghana Education Service (GES), with the Attorney General (AG) also joined. The Supreme Court must now interpret the Constitution to clarify individual religious rights within state-assisted institutions.


Opposing Declarations: Individual Rights vs. Christian Heritage and Systemic Rigidity


The Plaintiff, Mr. Osman, asserts that the Constitution guarantees freedom of worship. He contends that no school should coerce students to follow its religious practices.


The Wesley Girls School Board publicly denied all discrimination allegations. It asserts that any reported restrictions were misinterpreted. The school maintains its right to uphold its established Christian values.




Former GES Director-General Dr. Charles Aheto-Tsegah warned that the highly regimented nature of Ghana’s boarding schools makes full religious accommodation difficult. He emphasised that the school is a system that is ""programmed,"" with a precise, minute-by-minute schedule from a typical 4:30 AM wake-up call to 10:00 PM lights-out. Integrating varied observances requires a ""very interesting reconfiguration.""


 


AG and Methodist Church Defend Institutional Identity


The Attorney General and Minister for Justice, Dominic Ayine, filed a formal response backing the school's policies. The AG argues that WGHS, owned and operated by the Methodist Church, is entitled to maintain rules consistent with its heritage. Deputy Attorney-General Dr. Justice Srem-Sai affirmed that government financial support does not override the school’s religious rights.


The Methodist Church emphasises that mission schools predate the Ghanaian state. It contends that state funding must not be misconstrued as authority to redefine church-founded institutions. The Church warned that allowing parallel religious practices could cause administrative challenges and fracture communal unity.


The Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference (GCBC) and the Christian Council of Ghana (CCG) underscored their proprietary claim over their institutions, stating that the schools' establishment was an ""expression of our missionary mandate."" The Churches maintain that state support is a partnership, not a takeover of ownership. They cautioned that allowing diverse religious practices, including separate prayer schedules, could fracture communal unity and discipline.



 


Political Tension and Advocacy


The lawsuit sparked significant political and public debate. Education Minister Haruna Iddrisu publicly defended students' rights. He stated that the government would not countenance any action that denies a Ghanaian girl the opportunity to practice her religion. This stance highlights a political dilemma between the Minister’s defense of rights and the AG’s legal defense of the school's identity.


Interior Minister Muntaka Mubarak cautioned against growing intolerance in all faith-based schools. He urged institutions to ensure fairness and respect for religious diversity. He noted the generally high standard of accommodation in Christian mission schools, stating, ""I can say with authority that over 80% of these Christian-based schools are very accommodating."" However, he also warned that ""Some of the Muslim schools are beginning to also do"" discriminatory practices, such as restricting lunch for non-Muslim students during Ramadan. He insisted that such intolerance must be addressed firmly, regardless of its source.


Public advocates like Kofi Asare questioned the necessity of the restrictions, noting that Muslim students observe Ramadan at other Christian schools like PRESEC Legon. The case is widely seen as an opportunity to address a systemic issue of religious non-accommodation. Democracy Hub was granted leave to file an amicus curiae brief, confirming the broad public interest in the constitutional implications.


 


Scope of Demands and MoU Adherence


The core demands and institutional positions have been sharply defined. The National Muslim Conference of Ghana (NMCG) clarified that Muslim students are seeking only the right to pray, fast, and not be compelled to attend church activities. They are not requesting the construction of mosques. The NMCG cited the GES Directive on Religious Tolerance (2015) and the April 2024 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) as proof of the unconstitutionality of suppression. The MoU, involving mission schools and religious authorities, requires respect for religious diversity.




In its official response, the Methodist Church Ghana committed to defending its interests in court. It reiterated its rejection of discrimination, pointing to WGHS's nearly two-century history of educating students from diverse faiths. The Church asserted that discrimination is inconsistent with Christian teaching. It clarified that students are only expected to adhere to an established framework for unity and discipline. The Church explicitly confirmed its full adherence to the 2024 MoU.


 


Global Precedent: Comparative Religious Governance


Ghana's constitutional dilemma is mirrored globally, with varied resolutions.



Africa/Asia: Decisions often favor constitutional rights. In Nigeria, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Muslim students wearing the hijab in affiliated schools.


Europe (UK/France): Approaches differ. The United Kingdom subjects state-funded faith schools to anti-discrimination laws. France enforces strict secularism (laïcité) in public schools, limiting conspicuous religious expression for all.


Americas (US): The U.S. model focuses on government neutrality in fully secular schools. This model is less relevant given Ghana's mission-owned system.



The Ghanaian court’s final judgment will determine whether its legal interpretation aligns with the constitutional protections seen in parts of Africa or the institutional balancing acts common in Europe. The ruling will reshape how religious pluralism is balanced with institutional autonomy in Ghana's educational system, setting a precedent for all faith-based, government-assisted secondary schools.

Mahama commends organisers of 2025 Doha Forum for awarding Alex Thier and Saad Mohseni,"President John Dramani Mahama has commended the organisers of the 2025 Doha Forum for presenting this year’s awards to Alex Thier and Saad Mohseni.




The President said this was in recognition of the works, Alex Thier and Saad Mohseni were doing in closing educational learning gaps in two societies that were undergoing some of the worst crises known in recent history.


The awards were given during the opening ceremony of the Doha Forum 2025, by the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, on December 6.


The two were recognized for their “transformative” work in supporting children’s education in challenging environments, particularly Palestine and Afghanistan.


President Mahama gave the commendation in his address at the 2025 Doha Forum on the theme: “Justice in Action: Beyond Promises to Progress”.




Speaking on the topic “Education as Justice in Times of Crisis,” President Mahama said even in normal times, policymakers were always examining how to reform education to make it universally available and relevant in the context of a rapidly changing world.


He noted that the demand was even more urgent in societies that were affected by war and dislocation.


“The disruption of education affecting a current generation of children in Gaza, in Afghanistan, Sudan and elsewhere is an unfolding humanitarian tragedy that will play out for decades to come,” the President said.


He reiterated that Ghana’s own journey demonstrated that the most resilient nations were those that prioritised education even in the most challenging moments.



He said over the past decades, Ghanaians had pursued bold reforms to expand opportunity and strengthen justice through education.


“For example, our free basic and secondary education have enabled millions of Ghanaian youth to access education regardless of their family income,” he said.


The President said investments in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVETs) and digital literacy, strengthening early childhood and basic education.


He said a period when the world innovated for educational justice was during COVID-19.




“Schools were closed across the world and countries. Various countries had to innovate and implemented some of the most adaptive education in emergency times. Nationwide radio and TV learning programs were launched,” he said.


President Mahama noted that digital platforms for remote learning were deployed, community-based teaching and tutoring were provided and teachers were supported to innovate new methods to keep learning alive.


He said these measures were expression of justice, ensuring that no child was abandoned in a moment of global crisis.


He said the global experience during the COVID pandemic demonstrated that education systems could be built with resilience at their core.




The President underscored that when crisis hits, classrooms should not be the first to close and the last to reopen; declaring that they must remain anchors of hope, stability and protection.


He said the conversation of education as justice in times of crisis was relevant to Africa, where 30 million children remain out of school; stating that millions more were in school but not learning.


President Mahama said climate-related emergencies were displacing communities and shutting down schools, and that digital divides were widening socioeconomic gaps.


He said education was not the only focus of the Sustainable Development Goal Four (SDG 4), Quality Education, but also the enabler of all the other sustainable goals.




“Because without education, we cannot end poverty, which is SDG 1. Without education, we cannot achieve good health and well-being, which is SDG 3. Without education, we cannot attain gender equality, which is SDG 5,” he stated.


“Without education, we cannot build decent work and economic growth, which is SDG 8. Without education, we cannot strengthen climate adaptation, which is SDG 13. And without education, we cannot secure peace, justice and strong institutions, which is SDG 16.”


He said education illuminates the path to every other goal and that it empowers individuals, strengthens institutions and transforms nations.


“If we want a just, peaceful and prosperous world, we must start by ensuring just, equitable and resilient education systems.”




The President said the theme of the 2025 Doha Forum reminds the world that justice is not confined to domestic laws.


“It is a global concern. Education is a global public good, and when children in one region are denied the opportunity to learn due to conflict or poverty, the entire world loses talent, innovation and potential.”

PFAG forms multi-stakeholder platform to push inclusive agriculture growth,"The Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana (PFAG), the national apex farmer-based association has formed a Multi-Stakeholder Platform (MSP), to advocate inclusive agricultural development in the Nkoranza South Municipality of the Bono East Region.




The MSP comprises representatives of the Nkoranza South Municipal Assembly, Civil Society Organisations, processors, aggregators, traditional authorities, youth and women’s groups.


They will also engage duty bearers and rights holders as well as identify and tackle bottlenecks in policies and development issues affecting smallholder farmers.


At a meeting of the MSP at Nkoranza, Dr Benjamin Sarfo, the Programmes Officer of the PFAG, explained that the formation of the Platform aligned with the “Strengthening Farmers’ Voices to Promote Accountability and Inclusive Decision-Making in Ghana” project.


He said the Association with funding from the Star Ghana Foundation was implementing the project in the Wa Municipality and Daffiema Bussie Issah Districts in the Upper West Region, Nanumba North District in the Northern Region, Nkoranza Municipality in the Bono East Region, Krachi East District in the Oti Region and Chereponi District in the North East Region.




Dr Sarfo expressed concern that smallholder farmers faced a complex web of challenges including high input costs, limited access to mechanisation and irrigation, poor market linkages, and external threats like illegal mining and climate change impacts.


These constraints not only undermine their livelihoods but also compromise national food systems, he stated, saying that despite their central role, smallholder farmers lacked the agency and capacity to effectively engage local authorities.


That is due to weak farmer group structures, limited knowledge of advocacy and accountability frameworks, and insufficient recognition by local governance structures.


Dr Sarfo said the PFAG sought to give a life of dignity to its members most especially women and youth, yet many of them remained among the poorest and most vulnerable populations.



“They are often overlooked by development policies and underserved by institutional support, hence the need to effectively institutionalise this MSP to tackle key barriers affecting farmers in the municipality,” he stated.


Dr Sarfo also took the MSP through an overview of the PFGA and stressed their core mandates, objectives, activities, achievements so far and its national recognition in advocating good policies for farmers nationwide.


He also shared with participants the progress of the Star Ghana Foundation project, stressing the key challenges smallholder farmers faced during the periods of needs assessment and advocacy capacity building sessions.


Dr Sarfo emphasised the need to use the platform for improved policy and budgetary responsiveness at the local level, enhanced accountability and service delivery and institutionalise regular, constructive engagement among all actors, fostering shared understanding and coordinated action to address agricultural challenges.




Ahestofeil Appiah, a representative from the Nkoranza South Municipal Assembly, said there was a need to put the platform into effective use to address the pertinent challenges impeding agricultural growth and development in the municipality.


“While local platforms for engagement exist, resource constraints often prevent assemblies from convening them regularly, especially the committees of agriculture,” he said.


Mr Appiah said the PFAG's initiative through the Star Ghana Foundation project was laudable and would be supported by the assembly.


Gifty Fremah Appiah, the Nkoranza South Municipal Director of Agriculture, highlighted the need to sustain the platform beyond the project lifespan, noting that several platforms had been instituted in the past few years to promote similar agendas; however, they became non-functional after the closure of the projects.




Paul Owusu Achiaw, a Reverend Minister and a farmer was selected as the lead conveyer of the MSP platform and to be co-chaired by Mrs Appiah and they pledged their commitment to make the platform functional and respond to the needs of farmers in the municipality.


Rose Yahaya, the Queen mother of Adoagyir Traditional Area in the Municipality, lauded the formation of the platform and urged all members to support its effectiveness.


Dr Gillian S. Duut, a representative of the Nkoranza South Municipal office of the National Commission for Civic Education urged the members to remain committed to meetings.


That would facilitate growth of the MSP in the municipality and expressed the hope that with the platform challenges confronting youth and women farmers would be tackled.

Galamsey fight: NAIMOS set to deploy 50 officers to Western Region,"The National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) is set to deploy the first batch of 50 officers to help intensify the fight against illegal mining (galamsey) activities in the Western Region.




‎They would be stationed across three areas, namely, Ahanta West, Wassa Amenfi East municipalities, and Ellembelle District, and would also supervise the operations of the other assemblies.


Lieutenant Colonel (Lt. Col.) Joshua Satekla, Deputy Director of Operations at NAIMOS, said this during a stakeholder engagement with Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs), and two Regional Police Commanders in the Western Region at Sekondi.


The meeting was to brief participants on the Secretariat’s role in combating the galamsey and seek the support from the MMDCEs for the first set of officers scheduled for deployment to the region.


Lt. Col. Satekla stated that the mandate given to the NAIMOS by the government was vital in ensuring that water bodies and forest reserves were protected from destruction by galamsey, adding that they could only achieve that with the support of all stakeholders.




He said: “We are not in to stop mining, but we are there to stop illegal mining and people mining some key priority areas, so there is a need for us to work together to ensure a sustainable environment for all.”


He, however, mentioned interference from politicians, chiefs, and other influential individuals as a major obstacle in the fight against illegal mining.


Lt. Col. Satekla said inadequate logistics were a problem hindering them from effectively delivering on their mandates.


“Our two key challenges are interference from influential people, and we have that from the politicians, chiefs and other key stakeholders in the various areas where we have worked.



“And the other one is logistics, which are big problems that we need to discuss,” he stated.


Lt. Col. Satekla, therefore, called for the full support of the local assemblies, stressing that a collective effort was essential in combating illegal mining in the country.


The MMDCEs took turns to express their support and work with the NAIMOS to help fight the galamsey menace in their respective areas.

Young African professionals urged to drive innovation to build a resilient future,"Innovation is increasingly being recognised as a critical driver of resilient development across Africa. With the continent facing rapid urbanisation, rising youth unemployment, climate pressures, and persistent infrastructure gaps, experts say traditional development models are no longer adequate. 




Many African countries are now turning toward innovation-driven systems as global competition intensifies and technology reshapes economies.


It is against this backdrop that the 2025 Innovation Forum, hosted by the Certified Innovation Professionals Association (CIPA) at NIBS University in Accra, convened academics, students, industry players, and policy actors to discuss practical ways African countries can accelerate innovation for sustainable development.


The forum, held under the theme “Sustainability Through Innovation: Building Resilient Systems for Tomorrow”, sought to equip young professionals with the skills, mindset, and tools needed to address the continent’s most urgent challenges through creativity and strategic thinking.


Speaking to JoyNews, Dr Evans Duah, Head of International Relations at AAMUSTED, emphasised that Africa’s transformation depends largely on young people shifting from passive complaint to active problem-solving.







He encouraged them to identify local problems such as waste management, food insecurity, energy access, and housing and design practical solutions capable of scaling across communities.


CIPA President, Dr Richard Ampofo Boadu, highlighted the association’s growing role in Ghana’s innovation space. 


He explained that the Certified Innovation Professional programme equips participants with structured innovation tools, design thinking skills, and practical frameworks that organisations can use to strengthen their processes.


 According to him, the programme attracts people from diverse fields, reflecting Ghana’s increasing interest in building a more innovation-aware professional culture.



The forum also marked the graduation and induction of 14 students from Cohort 15 as new CIPA members. One of the inductees shared his aspiration to transfer knowledge to younger generations, especially on the future of business, global competitiveness, and creating sustainable systems that prepare graduates for an evolving job market.


Organisers say the forum forms part of broader efforts to strengthen an innovation-driven ecosystem in Ghana at a time when the continent is pushing for digital transformation, industrialisation, and green growth.


They are calling on young professionals, businesses, and institutions to adopt practical, locally relevant, and sustainable solutions that can drive long-term development across Africa.

Education is a fundamental enabler for achieving all SDGs  Mahama,"President John Dramani Mahama has reiterated that education is a fundamental enabler for achieving all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).




The President said this in an address at the 2025 Doha Forum on the theme: “Justice in Action: Beyond Promises to Progress”.


The SDGs are 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all by 2030, integrating economic, social, and environmental dimensions.


“Education is not the only focus of SDG 4, quality education, but also the enabler of all the other sustainable goals. Because without education, we cannot end poverty, which is SDG 1,” he said.


“Without education, we cannot achieve good health and well-being, which is SDG 3. Without education, we cannot attain gender equality, which is SDG 5.”




He said without education, nations of the world could not build decent work and economic growth, which was SDG 8. “Without education, we cannot strengthen climate adaptation, which is SDG 13. And without education, we cannot secure peace, justice and strong institutions, which is SDG 16.”


He said education illuminated the path to every other goal and that it empowered individuals, strengthened institutions and transformed nations.


“If we want a just, peaceful and prosperous world, we must start by ensuring just, equitable and resilient education systems,” he said.


The President noted that the theme of the 2025 Doha Forum reminded the world that justice was not confined to domestic laws and that it was a global concern.



“Education is a global public good, and when children in one region are denied the opportunity to learn due to conflict or poverty, the entire world loses talent, innovation and potential,” President Mahama said.


He underscored that if education was to serve nations justice in times of crisis, the global community must commit to certain key elements.


First, protecting education budgets in times of crisis, and that economic austerity should not begin in the classroom.


He also mentioned integrating education into humanitarian response plans, ensuring safety of schools and the learning environment, accelerating digital inclusion and investing in digital infrastructure, devices and teacher training.




The President also called for supporting teachers as agents of stability and strengthening global partnerships.


“Our world is changing fast. Our thinking about education must evolve just as rapidly,” he said.


President Mahama said education today must prepare young people to adapt to climate shocks, navigate digital disruptions, participate in democracy and governance, contribute to peaceful societies, and compete in a global economy that was increasingly driven by technology and innovation.


“Education must be transformational, not transactional. It must be equitable, not exclusive. It must be forward-looking and not outdated. This is the justice we owe our children,” he stated.




“Justice is not only delivered in the courtrooms. Justice lives in the classrooms. It is found in the moment a child learns to read. In the moment a young woman discovers her talent for science. In the moment a displaced child finds safety and hope in a school. In the moment, a teacher inspires courage in a new generation.”


President Mahama said if world leaders were to create a more peaceful, equitable and resilient world, then education must be their most significant investment and their boldest commitment.


This, President Mahama said, resonated with the saying that “knowledge is like a garden. If it is not cultivated, it cannot be harvested”.


“Let us cultivate the seeds of justice through education, especially in times of crisis, so that the harvest may be peace, prosperity and a shared humanity,” the President said.

Speaker Bagbin calls for unity and integrity in Parliament,"The Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, has rallied first-time Members of Parliament (MPs) to embrace a culture of transparency, accountability, and cooperation in the nation’s legislative body.




Speaking at an informal engagement session with new MPs, the Speaker emphasised that partisanship should not be a threat to democracy, but rather a means to strengthen it.


He said, “Ghana has consciously chosen a multiparty system, and differing viewpoints are essential to its strength.”


Mr Bagbin urged MPs to specialise in legislative areas, including Committee work, to deliver meaningful representation to their constituents.


He also stressed that Committee business was the engine of Parliament, and that diligent research, preparation, and participation were crucial to effective lawmaking.




Mr Bagbin also clarified misconceptions surrounding parliamentary privileges and immunities, saying, “They are not personal favors but safeguards for the people’s voice.”


He expressed concern over neglected constitutional provisions regarding local assembly members’ welfare and pledged to revitalize structures that strengthened decentralization.


The Speaker’s vision for a people-centered Parliament includes televised sessions with senior MPs, the media, and the public, promoting transparency and accountability.


Mr Bagbin also responded to criticisms about his attire, saying Ghana’s parliamentary dress reflects cultural pride and tradition.



He commended MPs for their contributions and assured them of his support as they grow in leadership, ethics, and legislative excellence.”

The set up of the OSP structurally had flaws  Mary Addah,"Executive Director of Transparency International-Ghana, Mary Addah, says the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) was built on a structural weakness from the very beginning.




She insists these flaws have affected its work to this day. 


Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on December 8, she said the problems that inspired the creation of the office have not improved, and in some cases have worsened, because the institution was never given a proper foundation.


Host Evans Mensah began by asking whether the real problem was the person holding the office or the institutional design around it. Her response was clear. “So it is both. It is both.”


She explained that the country has seen what a proper rollout looks like, and she used the RTI Commission to make that point. 




“Let me use the RTI example, for instance, to give you what we are talking about in the passage of the RTI law and the setting up of the commission. When the law was passed, we realised that there was a one-year cooling-off period to ensure that the office was set up and set up very well.”


According to her, Ghana did not follow the same standard when creating the OSP. 





“In the case of the SP, when the law was passed, by February, the SP was appointed. He didn’t have space to even operate, and so the first SP had his issues of setting up office, which office he wanted and who he was going to work with. He didn’t have staff. And for about three years, we went up and down.”


She said this alone showed how poorly the institution was launched. “So structurally, we had a flaw, a serious flaw, there and then in the office.”



Addah also pointed to the long-standing concerns over independence and political interference. 


“The issues around independence, either being substantive or otherwise, also remain a key problem, because we saw that in the execution of the mandate, we continue to see interference, and it led to the first SP leaving office and the second one taking office.”


She said public confidence made the situation worse. 


“But then, even as we remember that the appetite of citizens as well, and at the time, in the fight against corruption, was very low. 




""Because the trust levels were very low, we thought that the politician would do what they would do to get away with what they would do anyway. And so citizens' trust had dwindled...citizens believe.”


She said this lack of belief became deeper because of how some cases were handled. 


“And this has been entrenched by some of the cases that have come through the office. For instance, in the issue of Cecilia Dapaah, we saw that this case didn’t go anywhere. 


""And then now we also have the issue of the former Minister of Finance, who is also treading almost the same path and the trust of citizens, that’s why the voices are that loud.”




She admitted that institutions need time to take shape, but said that only works if the foundation is solid. “But it remains also true that in setting up an office, we should give them time to be able to settle in, to put in place structures.”


Evans asked whether eight years had not been enough. Her answer was simple. “Yes, it depends on what we have given them and how they are doing it.”

"Cecilia Dapaah, Ofori-Atta cases entrenched distrust in OSP  Mary Addah","Executive Director of Transparency International–Ghana, Mary Addah, says public trust in Ghana’s anti-corruption efforts has sunk even deeper because of how major cases involving high-profile officials have been handled by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP). 




She says the Cecilia Dapaah case and the ongoing matter involving the former Finance Minister have entrenched long-standing distrust among citizens who once hoped the OSP would transform accountability in the country.


Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on December 8, she said the failures of the office cannot be blamed on only one factor. 


“So it is both. It is both,” she said, responding to a question on whether the problem lies with the occupier of the office or with the structure itself.


She drew a comparison with how the RTI Commission was set up to explain the depth of the structural gaps. 




“Let me use the RTI example, for instance, to give you what we are talking about in the passage of the RTI law and the setting up of the commission. When the law was passed, we realised that there was a one-year cooling-off period to ensure that the office was set up and set up very well.”





She said the approach with the Special Prosecutor’s Office was the opposite. 


“In the case of the SP, when the law was passed, by February, the SP was appointed. He didn’t have space to even operate, and so the first SP had his issues of setting up office, which office he wanted and who he was going to work with. 


""He didn’t have staff. And for about three years, we went up and down. So structurally, we had a flaw, a serious flaw there.”



Mary Addah said independence was also compromised. 


“The issues around independence, either being substantive or otherwise, also remain a key problem, because we saw that in the execution of the mandate, we continue to see interference, and it led to the first SP leaving office and the second one taking office.”


She said public confidence had already been weak, and the OSP’s early struggles made things worse. 


“Remember that the appetite of citizens, as well, and at the time, in the fight against corruption, was very low. 




""Because the trust levels were very low, we thought that the politician would do what they would do to get away with what they would do anyway. And so, citizens' trust had dwindled citizens believe.”


She said specific cases deepened that distrust. 


“And this has been entrenched by some of the cases that have come through the office. For instance, in the issue of Cecilia Dapaah, we saw that this case didn’t go anywhere. 


""And then now we also have the issue of the former Minister of Finance, who is also treading almost the same path and the trust of citizens, that’s why the voices are that loud.”




Despite the concerns, she said new institutions need room to find their footing. 


“But it remains also true that in setting up an office, we should give them time to be able to settle in, to put in place structures.”


When host Evans Mensah asked whether eight years was not enough time, she responded that the answer depends on the tools the office has been given. 


“Yes, it depends on what we have given them and how they are doing it.”

A dangerous experiment  Sam Okudzeto questions foundation of OSP,"Former president of the Ghana Bar Association, Sam Okudzeto, has criticised the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), describing its very foundation as a dangerous experiment that was never grounded in necessity. 




Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on December 8, he questioned the logic, purpose and effectiveness of the institution, insisting that Ghana did not need a parallel prosecutorial body in the first place.


Okudzeto said the big question Ghanaians must confront is simple: why was the OSP created and what has it achieved? 


“Sometimes someone says it is not what you think you are entitled to, it is what you can give, but it should be. So you’re asking me this question. The question is simply this: why was the institution set up? Has it achieved its purpose?”


When host Evans Mensah pressed him for an answer, he did not hesitate. 




“I don’t think so. That is exactly the issue that I’m trying to drive here. He hasn’t achieved his purpose because the corruption is still on. I see it every day. Everywhere you turn in every institution, you see it openly. 


""They don’t even… they are not even afraid. People are no longer even afraid. You go there, and they demand money from you to do this for you, when you already paid.”


To him, this alone shows the OSP has failed to justify its existence. And when asked whether scrapping it is the solution, he stood firm. 


“Yeah, I’m saying that that institution is not achieving its purpose. Because look at it this way, you have an attorney general’s department. Is that not correct? Yes, in that department, they have a civil section, and then they have a prosecutorial section. This one is headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The other one is headed by the Solicitor General.”



He said the core functions already exist. “Now, what is the director of all prosecution supposed to do? He’s supposed to prosecute criminal offences which will include corruption, corruption-related. 


""There is nothing which makes corruption anymore different from any other crime. We have direct or to public prosecution, that is his job. Why do you create another institution to do the same job? That’s the whole issue.”


Evans Mensah reminded him that the OSP was created as a special-purpose vehicle. But Okudzeto rejected the model Ghana adopted. 


“You see, in other places where you have this special prosecutor, it means that there is a specific problem that has arisen, and you want that person to go there and solve that problem. 




""You don’t create the whole institution for it, as we have done; if you like, you can go and search and ask where and where we have that kind of institution?”


He referenced international and local prosecutorial traditions to make his point. 


“You see, the Prime Minister of England, you know what his position was before? You know how he got the knighthood? He was the director of public prosecution. Justice D. F. Anang, who became the Speaker of Parliament, was also Director of Public Prosecutions.”


For Okudzeto, the solution aligns with those calling for a return to the Attorney-General’s mandate. 




“That is what should have been done. But I suspect that somebody thought that corruption was too rampant in the country, and, therefore, to create an institution for that purpose was a good idea.”


He warned that the OSP became centred on an individual rather than an institutional system.


“And then, of course, you appoint an individual. Don’t forget, it’s just an individual you’ve appointed. Then you are now trying to create an institution around that individual. What is the background of that? That’s the question I ask. What is his background of that individual?”


He added that the problem is not solved by simply naming someone to a new office. “If I am going to try and select one of the top legal luminaries and say that I’m giving him that just a different thing.”




His final warning was blunt and stark. “I’m just saying that when you don’t train people to do a job, you think that creating institutions, particularly when they think it’s just an individual, it’s dangerous….It’s very, very dangerous.”

Corruption is still everywhere  Sam Okudzeto says OSP missed its mission,"Former president of the Ghana Bar Association, Sam Okudzeto, says corruption remains widespread in Ghana because the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) has failed to achieve the purpose for which it was created. 




He believes the institution has missed its mission and should never have existed in the first place.


Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on December 8, Mr Okudzeto said the country continues to see blatant acts of corruption in public institutions, making it clear that the OSP has not changed anything. 


He argued that the office has not delivered the results Ghanaians expected when it was established.


“Sometimes someone says it is not what you think you are entitled to, but it is what you can give. But it should be. So you’re asking me this question. The question is simply this: why was the institution set up? Has it achieved its purpose?” he asked.




Host Evans Mensah pushed further: “Has it? What would you say?”


“I don’t think so. That is exactly the issue that I’m trying to drive here. It hasn’t achieved its purpose, because the corruption is still on. I see it every day. Everywhere you turn in every institution, you see it openly. 


""They are not even afraid. People are no longer even afraid. You go there, and they demand money from you to do this for you when you already paid,” he said.


Asked whether scrapping the OSP would solve the problem, Mr Okudzeto insisted the office simply duplicates the mandate of existing state institutions and was unnecessary from the start.



“Yeah, I’m saying that that institution is not achieving its purpose. Because look at it this way, you have an Attorney-General’s Department. Is that not correct? Yes. In that department, they have a civil section, and then they have a prosecutorial section. This one is headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. 


""The other one is headed by the Solicitor General. Now, what is the Director of Public Prosecutions supposed to do? He’s supposed to prosecute criminal offences which will include corruption and corruption-related. 





""There is nothing which makes corruption any more different than any other crime. We have a Director of Public Prosecutions. That is his job. Why do you create another institution to do the same job? That’s the whole issue.”


Evans Mensah noted that the OSP was meant to be a special-purpose vehicle to deal only with corruption-related offences.




But Mr Okudzeto rejected that argument. He said countries that adopt a special prosecutor typically appoint one to tackle a specific problem, not build an entire institution around the role. 


According to him, Ghana’s decision to treat the position as a standalone office was misguided.


“You see, in other places where you have this special prosecutor, it means that there is a specific problem that has arisen, and you want that person to go there and solve that problem. You don’t create the whole institution for it, as we have done. 


""If you like, you can go and search and ask where and where do we have that kind of institution? You see, the Prime Minister of England, you know what his position was before? You know how he got the knighthood? He was the Director of Public Prosecutions. Justice D. F. Anang, who became the Speaker of Parliament, was also Director of Public Prosecutions,” he said.




Asked whether he agrees with those calling for the OSP to be scrapped and the Attorney-General’s Department strengthened instead, he responded without hesitation.


“That is what should have been done. But I suspect that somebody thought that corruption was too rampant in the country, and, therefore, to create an institution for that purpose was a good idea. And then, of course, you appoint an individual. Don’t forget, it’s just an individual you’ve appointed. 


""Then you are now trying to create an institution around that individual. What is the background of that? That’s the question I ask. What is his background of that individual? If I am going to try and select one of the top legal luminaries and say that I’m giving him that, that’s a different thing.”


He warned that building institutions around individuals without properly preparing them for the job is dangerous.




“I’m just saying that when you don’t train people to do a job, you think that creating institutions, particularly when they think it’s just an individual, it’s dangerous. It’s very, very dangerous,” he said.

Scrap it  Sam Okudzeto says Special Prosecutors office has achieved nothing,"Former President of the Ghana Bar Association, Sam Okudzeto, has criticised the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), insisting that the institution has failed to justify its existence and must be scrapped.




Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on December 8, Mr Okudzeto questioned the very foundation on which the office was created. 


He said the country must now confront a simple question: “Why was the institution set up? Has it achieved its purpose?”


When host Evans Mensah asked for his assessment, Mr Okudzeto did not hesitate. “I don’t think so,” he responded. 


“That is exactly the issue that I’m trying to drive here. He hasn’t achieved his purpose because the corruption is still on. I see it every day. Everywhere you turn in every institution, you see it openly. 




""They are not even afraid. People are no longer even afraid. You go there, and they demand money from you to do this for you, when you already paid.”


Pressed on whether scrapping the OSP was the answer, he stated plainly that the office has outlived its usefulness. 


“Yeah, I’m saying that that institution is not achieving its purpose. Because look at it this way, you have an Attorney General’s Department. In that department, they have a civil section, and then they have a prosecutorial section. This one is headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Responding to suggestions that the OSP was established as a special-purpose vehicle dedicated solely to corruption, he argued that Ghana got it wrong from the start. 


“You see, in other places where you have this special prosecutor, it means that there is a specific problem that has arisen, and you want that person to go there and solve that problem. 


""You don’t create the whole institution for it, as we have done. If you like, you can go and search and ask where and where do we have that kind of institution?”




Mr Okudzeto referenced global examples to support his position. 


“You see, the Prime Minister of England, you know what his position was before? You know how he got the knighthood? He was the Director of Public Prosecutions. Justice D. F. Annan, who became the Speaker of Parliament, was also Director of Public Prosecution.”


He aligned himself fully with those calling for the OSP to be scrapped and the Attorney General’s office strengthened instead. 


“That is what should have been done,” he said. 




“But I suspect that somebody thought that corruption was too rampant in the country, and, therefore, to create an institution for that purpose was a good idea. And then, of course, you appoint an individual. 


""Don’t forget, it’s just an individual you’ve appointed. Then you are now trying to create an institution around that individual. What is the background of that? That’s the question I ask. What is his background of that individual?”


He cautioned that the entire experiment was flawed from the beginning. 


“I’m just saying that when you don’t train people to do a job, you think that creating institutions, particularly when they think it’s just an individual, it’s dangerous… It’s very, very dangerous.”




Mr Okudzeto stressed that Ghana already has the structures to prosecute corruption, and the focus should be on strengthening those systems rather than building parallel institutions that deliver little.

New mpox strain identified in England,"A new strain of mpox, previously called monkeypox, has been detected in a person in England, say UK health officials.




The virus is a mix of two major types of the mpox virus, and was found in someone who recently returned from travelling in Asia.


Officials say they are still assessing the significance of the new strain.


The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it is normal for viruses to evolve. Getting vaccinated remains the best way to protect against severe disease - although an mpox infection is mild for many.


The new virus strain contains elements of two mpox strains, called clade Ib and clade IIb. It currently has no name.




UK health officials recently encouraged gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men to make sure they were vaccinated against mpox.


That call came as a strain called 'clade Ib' showed early signs of local spread in some European countries.


'Clade IIb' is linked to a global outbreak of mpox in 2022 which affected many countries worldwide.


In the UK, vaccination is available for groups of people at highest risk of catching mpox:




those who have multiple sexual partners


those who engage in group sex


those who visit sex-on-premises venues



Health officials say the vaccine is 75-80% effective at protecting against mpox.


There have been no studies on how well the vaccine protects against this latest strain, although it's thought there will be a high degree of protection.


Dr Katy Sinka, head of sexually transmitted infections at UKHSA, said genomic testing had allowed it to be detected.


""It's normal for viruses to evolve, and further analysis will help us understand more about how mpox is changing.




""Getting vaccinated is a proven effective way to protect yourself against severe disease, so please make sure to get the jab if you are eligible,"" she said.


Prof Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network at the University of Oxford, said there were ""excellent systems"" to identify cases and control onward infection in the UK, but in other parts of the world, in more vulnerable populations, ""this is harder to achieve"", where access to vaccines is not as reliable.


Prof Lang said if further cases of this strain appeared in the UK and elsewhere, it would be important to understand how it's being spread and how ill it makes people, in order to assess whether it's more or less dangerous than previous strains.


There have been nearly 48,000 confirmed cases of mpox globally in 2025, and 2,500 in the past month, with most occurring in central Africa.




Dr Boghuma Titanji, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, said the new strain is what experts feared would happen if mpox continued to spread worldwide.


""The more mpox circulation we permit, the more opportunities the virus has to recombine and adapt, further entrenching mpox virus as a human pathogen that is not going away,"" she said.


What is mpox?


Mpox can be a unpleasant illness.


Common symptoms are lesions or a skin rash, which can last for two to four weeks, plus fever, headaches, back pain, muscle aches and tiredness.




The virus spreads from person to person through close physical contact, coughs or sneezes and touching infected clothing, bedding or towels.


Health officials say anyone who thinks they might have mpox, should contact NHS 111 for advice on what to do.

Why has Paramount launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros Discovery?,"The fight in Hollywood to buy Warner Bros Discovery is shaping up to be a blockbuster.




Paramount Skydance, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, has been wooing Warner Bros for months, hoping to join forces with the storied Hollywood name as the media company struggles to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney.


So far, Warner Bros has spurned its proposals. Then it announced a deal to sell the most valuable parts of its business - its studio and streaming divisions - to Netflix instead.


Undeterred, Paramount chief executive David Ellison launched a hostile takeover bid, making his suit directly to shareholders.


What is a hostile takeover bid?


In corporate deals, a hostile takeover is when a company moves to acquire another firm without the consent of the target company's management, typically by offering to buy its target company's shares.




It differs from a friendly takeover - one that is mutually agreed upon by the boards of directors and shareholders at both companies.


What do we know about the two bids?


Netflix's proposal includes Warner Bros' studio and streaming networks, leaving the rest of the company to be spun off as an independent company.


Its offer values those holdings which include brands such as Warner Bros, New Line Cinema, and HBO Max, at $82.7bn, including debt.


Netflix is offering to pay $23.25 per share, and give existing Warner Bros a stake in the new company - a mix of cash and equity it says is worth about $27.75 per share.



Paramount, by contrast, says it wants control of the entire company, including the firm's traditional pay-TV networks, which are seen as a declining business.


Its deal values the entire company at $108.4bn.


Paramount is proposing to pay $30 per share, in an all-cash offer, which it says gives shareholders more certainty than Netflix's plan.


In both cases, the target completion date is many months away.







Why do Paramount and Netflix want Warner Bros?


Warner Bros, which traces its roots back about a century, has a vast library of content, ranging from classics like Looney Tunes and Casablanca to Friends, Superman and Harry Potter. Its HBO division is known for ""prestige"" television, including The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Succession.


But the storied firm has been under pressure as online streaming has disrupted film and television industries.


For Netflix, the streaming industry's biggest player with more than 300 million customers, buying the film and streaming division would bolster its movie offerings, while heading off any potential rivals looking to get their hands on the Warner Bros content.


Paramount, by contrast, is looking for a partner that will give it the scale to compete against industry giants such as Netflix and Disney.




A takeover would build on Mr Ellison's purchase of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio over the summer.


On the streaming side, he is looking to add HBO Max's roughly 120 million streaming customers to Paramount's 79 million.


Analysts say a tie-up could offer benefits to the struggling traditional pay TV networks as well, giving them greater clout in business negotiations and presenting opportunities for cost savings.


Paramount's traditional networks include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central, while Warner Bros would bring CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.




Who is likely to win?


Both deals raise competition concerns and are expected to face scrutiny from regulators in the US and Europe.


Netflix's plan has drawn warnings that it would give the dominant streaming player even more power over actors and screenwriters, while putting further pressure on local cinemas.


But a combined Paramount-Warner Bros would also leave it in control of a significant slice of sports and children's entertainment, raising potential concern for advertisers and local television distributors.


Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.




Analysts said approval would likely hinge on how broadly regulators decide to define the market, and whether players like YouTube are considered part of the competition.


Netflix is relatively new to deal-making.


Some have also suggested that Paramount could be in a stronger position thanks to the relationship between Trump and the Ellison family, including tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Larry Ellison. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is also one of Paramount's financial partners.


But Trump himself has offered little certainty about his views.




Though he has praised the Ellisons in the past, on social media on Monday, he took aim at their ownership of Paramount, triggered by a 60 Minutes interview that the company aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.


Previously, he had noted potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up, given the size of the company, while also praising the streamer's bosses.


How could the deal affect consumers?


It's not clear.


Neither Netflix nor Paramount have offered much insight into how they would incorporate Warner Bros into their current offerings or seize the opportunity to launch new kinds of streaming packages.


When it comes to prices, boosting Netflix's offerings could allow it to charge customers more. But if viewers find they are paying for one streaming service rather than two, it could cost them less.


More than 70% of HBO Max customers in the US also subscribe to Netflix, according to analysts at Raymond James.

White South Africans divided on US refugee offer,"The 4m-high (13ft) electric steel gates, capped with spikes, creak open as Marthinus, a farmer, drives through in his pick-up truck. Cameras positioned at the entrance track his every move, while reams of barbed wire surround the farm in the rural Free State province in the heart of South Africa.




""It feels like a prison,"" he says as the gates clank shut behind him. ""If they want to come and kill us they can. At least it will take them time to get to me.""


The fear of being attacked is very real for the white Afrikaner, who manages a farm with his wife and two young daughters. He did not want us to use his full name.


His grandfather and his wife's grandfather were both murdered in farm attacks, and he lives a two-hour drive from where the body of 21-year-old farm manager Brendan Horner was discovered five years ago, tied to a pole, with a rope around his neck.


Marthinus says he can't take a chance with his own family and, in February, they applied for refugee status in the US.




""I'm prepared to do that to get a better life for my wife and children. Because I don't want to be slaughtered and be hanged on a pole,"" he says.


""Our Afrikaner people are an endangered species.""


Not all white South Africans agree that they're being targeted and black farmers are also victims of the country's high crime rate.


Marthinus will be leaving his farm behind if he moves to the US


It's estimated that thousands of Afrikaners - who are mostly white descendants of early European settlers - have begun the lengthy process of applying for refugee status in the US since President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year, although the figures haven't been made public.



Despite announcing in October that the US would reduce its yearly intake of refugees from 125,000 to 7,500, Trump has made the resettlement of Afrikaners a priority.


A presidential document posted to the official daily journal of the US government stated that those accepted would ""primarily"" be Afrikaner South Africans and ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands"".


For Marthinus it's a way out.


""I will give my whole life just so that my wife and my kids can be safe. Living in fear, you know? Nobody deserves a life like that.""




Violent crime in South Africa is endemic.


The latest crime figures released in November for the first quarter of 2025 show there was an average of 63 murders every day. While this was a decrease on the same period in 2024, South Africa's homicide rate remains one of the highest in the world.


Farmer Thabo Makopo is also worried about being targeted by criminals


Black farmers are also victims.


On the outskirts of Ficksburg, a town at the foot of Free State's Imperani Mountain, Thabo Makopo has a small farm of 237 acres (96 hectares), where he tends sheep and cattle. Like Marthinus, the 45-year-old says farm attacks are his biggest problem.




""They are young men. They are armed and dangerous. Whether they will lose their life or take yours, they are going to take those livestock,"" he says.


Thabo believes all farmers in the province, regardless of their race, are at risk of attack.


""It's all of us. I could be attacked today - it could happen to any of us.""


Police response rates to reports of crime are notoriously low, something the police here acknowledge but have said publicly that they are working on.




In the meantime, South Africans are becoming increasingly dependent on private security. According to the official regulatory body for the private security sector in South Africa, there are more than 630,000 active security guards. That is more than the police and army combined.


Morgan Barrett rejects the idea that there is a white genocide


Many farmers, like Morgan Barrett, who is white, employ their own security guards, if they can afford it. He owns a 2,000-acre farm which has been in his family for six generations.


Wrapped up in a thick jacket and hat, he climbs into his car to begin a night patrol. Between Morgan and his neighbours, they are out almost every night. Six of his cattle were stolen the previous week.


""You can call the police, and they may turn up two or three hours later, by which time the thieves will have run away,"" he says.




Like Thabo, he doesn't believe he is targeted because of the colour of his skin.


""I don't buy that narrative that in this area the attacks are against whites only.""


""If they thought that the black guy had 20,000 rand ($1,200; £880) sitting in his safe, they'd attack him just as quickly as they'd attack the white guy with 20,000 [rand] in the safe.""


Asked about what he thinks of people claiming there is a ""white genocide"" in South Africa, he says he thinks they ""have no real understanding of what a genocide is"".




""What happened in Rwanda is genocide. What is happening to white farmers is very bad, but I don't think you can call it genocide.""


Trump has repeated the widely disputed claims there is a genocide against white farmers, while South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, has accused South African politicians of ""actively promoting"" a genocide.


The government here has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other white South Africans are being persecuted.


The country does not release crime figures based on race, but in May, in order to debunk these claims, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu gave a breakdown of killings on farms.


Mchunu said that between October 2024 and March 2025, there were 18 farm murders across South Africa. Sixteen of the victims were black, while two were white.


Despite these statistics, the theory that white people are being persecuted for their race, once an idea confined to far-right groups in South Africa, continues to be propelled into the mainstream.


Systematic racial persecution is something black people in South Africa, who make up more than 80% of the population, have faced for decades.


Under the apartheid system that lasted for 46 years from 1948, the white-minority government legally separated people based on the colour of their skin.


It was built on already existing discriminatory legislation.


The right to vote, buy land and work in skilled jobs was reserved for white people. Millions of black South Africans were removed from their land and forced to live in segregated neighbourhoods where education in schools was restricted to maintain racial hierarchy.


The regime was enforced through violence and repression.


Even though apartheid ended in 1994, the profound racial inequalities continue to exist more than 30 years later.


The post-apartheid government did introduce affirmative action policies to try and redress some of the issues, but these have been criticised by some for not being effective and introducing ""race quotas"".


Nevertheless, 72% of private farmland is still in white hands, according to the government's 2017 Land Audit report. That's despite white people making up just 7.3% of the population.


A land reform programme - based on the principle of willing-seller, willing-buyer - has hardly moved the dial. A new law this year does give the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners, but this is only in rare circumstances, according to legal experts who spoke to the BBC.


And while white farmers own more private land than any other group in the country, victims of farm attacks span across all races.


The political spotlight is on white farmers, yet crime and violence on the ground is indiscriminate.


Nthabiseng Nthathakana's husband died when criminals attacked their small shop


In Meqheleng, a township on the outskirts of Ficksburg where black South Africans were forcibly relocated during the apartheid regime, Nthabiseng Nthathakana owns a small general store.


On 15 January this year, there was a robbery while her husband, Thembani Ncgango, was closing up. He managed to run to a neighbour's house but his attackers threatened to kill them if they opened the door.


Nthabiseng found Thembani's body on the ground outside.


""He had bullets everywhere and stab wounds. They had stabbed him and hit him with rocks,"" she says.


No one has been arrested for his murder.


Nthabiseng is now the sole provider for her four children.


""The kids ask questions: 'Mama, who killed Dad?' And you don't know what to say,"" she says.


Two hours' drive from Ficksburg, Marthinus and his family have just found out their refugee application to the US has been successful.


They're busy planning the big move, waiting to hear when their flights will be allocated.


He maintains that white people are being persecuted in South Africa.


""A lot of people believe that it's a political thing to get rid of us as white farmers or white people in this country, so they can have this land for themselves and this place for themselves.


""I'm really grateful to be getting away from this feeling of fear. I'm thankful to almighty God for answering our prayers.""

Australias social media ban for children has left big tech scrambling,"When Stephen Scheeler became Facebook's Australia chief in the early 2010s, he was a true believer in the power of the internet and social media for the public good.




It would herald a new era of global connection and democratise learning. It would let users build their own public squares without the traditional gatekeepers.


""There was that heady optimism phase when I first joined, and I think a lot of the world shared that,"" he told the BBC.


But by the time he left the firm in 2017, seeds of doubt about its work had been planted, and they've since bloomed.


""There's lots of good things about these platforms, but there's just too much bad stuff,"" he surmises.




That's no longer an uncommon view as scrutiny of the largest social media companies has increased around the globe. A lot of it has centred on teenagers, who have emerged as a lucrative market for incredibly wealthy global firms - at the expense of their mental health and wellbeing, according to critics.


Various governments, from the state of Utah to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media.


But the most radical step so far is set to unfold in Australia - a ban for under-16s that kicks in on 10 December has left tech companies scrambling.


Many of the social media firms affected have spent a year loudly protesting against the new law, which requires them to take ""reasonable steps"" to keep underage users from having accounts on their platforms.



They have claimed this ban actually risks making children less safe, argued it impinges on their rights, and repeatedly pointed to the questions around the tech that will be used to enforce the policy.


""Australia is engaged in blanket censorship that will make its youth less informed, less connected, and less equipped to navigate the spaces they will be expected to understand as adults,"" said Paul Taske from NetChoice, a trade group representing several big tech companies.


The worry inside the industry is that Australia's ban - the first of its kind - may inspire other countries.


""It could become a proof of concept that gains traction around the world,"" says Nate Fast, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.




Whistleblowers, lawsuits and questions


(L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in January


In recent years, multiple whistleblowers and lawsuits have claimed that social media firms are prioritising profits over user safety.


In January, a landmark trial will begin in the US hearing allegations that several – including Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube – have designed their apps to be addictive and knowingly covered up the harm their platforms cause. 


All deny this, but Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snap boss Evan Spiegel have both been ordered to testify in person.


The case consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, and is among the first to advance from a flood of similar lawsuits which allege social media contributes to poor mental health and child exploitation.




In another ongoing case, state prosecutors alleged that Zuckerberg personally scuttled efforts to improve the well-being of teens on the company's platforms, including vetoing a proposal to ditch Instagram's face-altering beauty filters, which experts say fuel body dysmorphia and eating disorders.


Former Meta employees Sarah Wynn-Williams, Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar have given testimony before the US Congress alleging a range of wrongdoing they observed during their stints at the company.


Meta maintains that the company has worked diligently to create tools that keep teens safe online.


But the broader industry has also recently been taken to task over mis- and disinformation, hate speech and violent content.




Graphic footage of the assassination of Charlie Kirk was rapidly spread on various platforms, even confronting people who were not seeking it out. Elon Musk has sued states in the US over laws that require social media firms, including X, to define and disclose how they fight hate speech online. And Meta was heavily criticised earlier this year after announcing it was getting rid of factcheckers who monitor its platforms for misinformation.


A rare bipartisan front has emerged among American lawmakers eager to cut tech bosses down to size.


During a hearing last year, Zuckerberg was prodded by one to apologise to bereaved families who had come to watch in person. Among those in the audience was Tammy Rodriguez, whose 11-year old daughter Selena took her life after facing sexual exploitation on Instagram and Snapchat.


""This is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer,"" Zuckerberg said.




Public scrutiny and private lobbying


However, there's widespread criticism from many experts, lawmakers and parents - even kids - who feel social media companies are hiding from genuine action and accountability on these issues.


As Australia's social media ban was considered, then formulated, the firms had little to say publicly.


""Hiding from the public discourse… it just breeds more suspicion and more distrust,"" Mr Scheeler says.


Privately though, many were seeking to bend the government's ear. Spiegel personally sat down with Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells. She also claimed YouTube had sent globally renowned children's entertainers The Wiggles to lobby on their behalf.




In carefully worded public statements, several of the firms have tried to push responsibility elsewhere. Meta and Snap both said operators of the major app stores – namely Apple and Google – should take on age verification duties.


And many argued government is overstepping. Parents know best, they say, and they should decide what makes sense for their teens when it comes to social media use.


Along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.


""While we're committed to meeting our legal obligations, we've consistently raised concerns about this law… There's a better way: legislation that empowers parents to approve app downloads and verify age allows families - not the government - to decide which apps teens can access,"" a statement from Meta provided to the BBC said.


Asked why her government was unsympathetic to this reasoning - why anything short of a ban was unacceptable - Wells said the tech companies have had plenty of time to improve their practices.


""They have had 15, 20 years in this space to do that of their own volition now, and… it's not enough.""


Leaders in other countries feel the same, and have been knocking on her door for help, she says, rattling off the EU, Fiji, Greece, even Malta, as examples.


Denmark and Norway have already begun work on similar laws, and Singapore and Brazil are watching closely too.


""We're pleased to be the first, we're proud to be the first, and we stand ready to help any other jurisdiction who seeks to do these things,"" Wells said.


Too little, too late?


As the Australia ban loomed, the mounting pressure prompted the companies to introduce versions of their products marketed as safer for young users, said Pinar Yildirim, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.


Australia, after all, is a major market for social platforms. At parliamentary hearings in October Snapchat said it believed it had about 440,000 account users in the country aged between 13 and 15. TikTok said it had about 200,000 under-16 accounts and Meta said it had about 450,000 between Facebook and Instagram.


Experts say they are also eager to ensure they don't lose others in even larger markets around the world.


Former Meta engineer Arturo Béjar speaks during a rally


In July, YouTube announced the rollout of AI technology that estimates a user's age in a bid to identify those younger than 18 and better shield them from harmful content.


Snapchat has special accounts for children which it says put safety and privacy settings on by default for users between the ages of 13 and 17.


And last year, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen accounts which similarly place users younger than 18 into more restricted privacy and content settings that Meta says are designed to limit unwanted contacts and exposure to explicit content. This development was accompanied by a massive marketing blitz in the US.


""If they create a more protected environment for these users, the thinking is, that may reduce some of the damage,"" Yildirim said.


Yet critics aren't satisfied. Béjar, one of the Meta whistleblowers, led a study published in September that found almost two thirds of the new safety tools on Meta's Instagram Teen accounts were ineffective.


""The key issue here is that Meta and other social media companies aren't substantively addressing the harm we know teens are experiencing,"" Béjar told the BBC.


Critics say social media firms haven't done enough to protect children


Forced onto the defensive, the companies have attempted to convey that they are making a good faith effort to comply with Australia's impending ban despite their disagreement with it.


But analysts say they'll be hoping the hurdles - which include legal challenges, technology loopholes for kids, and any unintended consequences of the ban - could bolster the case against such moves in other nations.


And the companies ""have a fair bit of influence in how smoothly things go"", Professor Fast points out.


""[They] have an incentive to walk the very fine line about complying, but making sure that they don't comply so good that all the rest of the other countries go, 'Great, that works. Let's do the same',"" Mr Scheeler agrees.


Former Facebook Australia chief Stephen Scheeler says social media companies have hidden from public discourse about the ban


And the fines - a maximum of A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) for serious breaches - might just be seen as the cost of doing business, according to Carnegie Mellon University marketing professor Ari Lightman. ""[They're] a drop in the bucket,"" he says, especially for larger players eager to secure their next generation of potential users.


Despite the concerns around the policy's implementation, Mr Scheeler says he feels like this is a ""seatbelt moment"" for social media.


""Some would argue that bad regulation is worse than no regulation, and sometimes that's true, but I think in this instance, even imperfect regulation is better than nothing, or better than what we had before,"" he says.


""Maybe it will work, maybe it won't work, but at least we're trying something.""

Trump gives Nvidia green light to sell advanced AI chips to China,"US President Donald Trump has announced that he will allow AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to ""approved customers"" in China.




""We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America's lead in AI,"" Trump said on social media on Monday.


The decision will apply to other US chip companies like AMD and comes after extensive lobbying by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, who visited Washington last week to drum up support.


Nvidia - both the world's leading chip firm and most valuable company - has found itself at the centre of a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China in recent months, and had been banned from selling its most advanced chips to Beijing.


Trump reversed the chip-selling ban in July, but demanded that Nvidia pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government.




Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to stop buying Nvidia chips manufactured for use in the Chinese market.


""We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,"" Nvidia said in a statement provided to BBC News.


Nvidia's H200 is a generation behind its Blackwell chip, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor.


Mr Huang told the BBC in September that the US needed ""to make sure that people can access this technology from all over the world, including China.""



He has also repeatedly warned that China, which has cultivated a chip production ecosystem of its own, was close behind the US in chip development.


Nvidia hailed Trump's announcement on Monday.


""Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,"" Nvidia said in its statement.


The companies shares rose slightly on the news.




Trump said ""$25% [sic] will be paid to the United States of America"" in his post.


The BBC has reached out to the White House for clarification on the arrangement, which will likely face opposition from national security hawks in Congress.


The sale of H200 chips to some Chinese customers ""buys time"" for the US to negotiate a deal with Beijing over rare earths and prevent major disruptions to global supply chains, Alex Capri from the National University of Singapore said.


China holds a near-monopoly on the processing of rare earth minerals, which are essential for the production of most electronics.




Although access to H200 chips is likely to benefit China's technology sector, Beijing is still expected to work towards reducing dependence on the US, Mr Capri said.


Beijing had previously directed local tech firms to reject Nvidia's older H20 chips and encouraged them to buy domestically produced semiconductors, he noted.


Researchers at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) said China's People's Liberation Army is using advanced chips designed by US companies to develop AI-enabled military capabilities.


""By making it easier for the Chinese to access these high-quality AI chips, you enable China to more easily use and deploy AI systems for military applications,"" said Cole McFaul, senior research analyst at CSET. ""They want to harness advanced chips for battlefield advantage.""

Dozens injured after magnitude 7.5 quake strikes northern Japan,"At least 30 people were injured after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit north-eastern Japan on Monday night, forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes.




The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31mi), about 80km off the coast of the Aomori region, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It prompted tsunami warnings which have now been lifted, while waves of 70cm (27in) were seen.


Some train services have been suspended and thousands of homes have been left without power as a result.


Authorities have also warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days - urging the public to remain on high alert for at least a week, according to local media reports.


Addressing citizens affected by the earthquake, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said: ""Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking.""




Orders were issued for about 90,000 residents to evacuate, according to Reuters news agency.


The Aomori prefectural government said around 2,700 homes have been left without power. East Japan Railway has also suspended some services along the north-eastern coast.


The Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre and convened an emergency team, chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara has said.


""We are making every effort to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures, including rescue and relief operations,"" he added.



Following the tremors, Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power said no irregularities were reported at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants as a result of the quake, Tohoku Electric Power said.


None were detected either at the disabled Fukushima nuclear power station site, the Japanese authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency.


Fukushima was damaged when a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off the country's eastern coast on 11 March 2011.


That quake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, triggered a tsunami which swept over the main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.




This home in Aomori prefecture was among those affected by the earthquake


Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.


It sits on the Ring of Fire and, as a result, experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year.


Earlier this year, Japan's earthquake investigation panel said there was a 60-90% chance that a megaquake would occur in the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, with worst-case scenarios suggesting it would cause trillions in damage, and potentially kill hundreds of thousands.





Earthquakes along the Nankai Trough - an area of seismic activity which stretches along Japan's Pacific coast - have already been responsible for thousands of deaths.

Telecel Ghana marks international Disability Day with STEM training and Christmas party,"Christmas came early for young students at the Demonstration School for the Deaf and the Akropong School for the Blind, as Telecel Ghana Foundation organised a robotics training session followed by a cheerful Christmas party for over 600 students from both institutions.




Held on the premises of the Demonstration school for the Deaf in Mampong - Akuapem to mark International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the initiative gave 100 Deaf students exposure and hands-on experience with designing and building walking robots, understanding electrical sources for motion and mobility robotics and the power of artificial intelligence.


The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) skills training was facilitated by Mingo Foundation and Telecel’s internal resource group, Ladies in Technology. 


All students who took part in the training received a free robotic kit to practise what they learned.


“With the STEM training, we want to ensure that students with disabilities are included in Ghana’s digital talent pipeline by giving them practical skills and the confidence to pursue opportunities in technology,” said Rita Agyeiwaa Rockson, Head of Foundation, Sustainability and External Communications at Telecel Ghana. 




“Beyond learning, we wanted to connect energies, celebrate the festive season and create beautiful memories together.”


The telco’s dedicated customer service team for Deaf and hard-of-hearing customers, known as Telecel Super Care, provided sign language interpretation during the STEM sessions and encouraged the students to consider careers in Ghana’s growing technology sector.


After the STEM training, the energy on campus shifted from learning to full celebration as Telecel staff volunteers, teachers, and students gathered for a massive Christmas party. 


Santa handed out gifts including stationery, sweets and adaptive toys, with staff volunteers serving food and joining the children in multiple talent competitions.



Headmaster of the Demonstration School for the Deaf, Setumte Ametewee, said the initiative offered valuable exposure to digital skills that the students often lack access to. 


“For too long, Deaf and Blind students have been relegated to the background, so this initiative is helpful because it gives them the hands-on and first-hand feel of how robotics and technology work. 


""They rely a lot on what they see or feel to make meaning of the things around them; hence, the training and party euphoria are making them feel valued.”


A cross-section of the students described the training as enlightening and said that it had sparked their interest in learning more about robotics and careers in the STEM field.




Makafui Ahiave is a final year junior high school student and the girls’ prefect of the Demonstration School for the Deaf. 


She said the STEM training was one of the exciting moments in her life, and it felt amazing learning about robotics.


“We learnt about how to put components of robotics together, and it has made me more skilful. I now have more interest in technology and would practise more with the robotics kit I have been given,” she said.


Telecel Foundation said the initiative, which forms part of its Connected Learning pillar, reflects an ongoing commitment to supporting students with disabilities through education, technology, and meaningful community engagement.




For last year’s celebration, the Foundation hosted a hands-on training session in robotics for Deaf students at the Tetteh Ocloo State School for the Deaf in Adjei Kojo within the Tema West municipality.


The Director of Human Resources at Telecel Ghana, Rachael Appenteng, believes the students’ exposure to robotics and career opportunities in STEM is a way of closing the digital gap and preparing their minds for a digital future.


“This is more than an annual observance for Telecel. It is part of our responsibility and our diversity and inclusion strategy to build a diversified talent pipeline to feed our industry. 


""It’s also all about showing these Deaf and Blind students that they belong in every work field, including technology, and I encourage other organisations to build an enabling and inclusive workforce,” she added.

Telecel director urges industry partnerships with academia to drive inclusive growth,"Director of Enterprise and Wholesale at Telecel Ghana, Tawa Bolarin, has called for a continuous exchange partnership between telecom operators and research institutions in developing solutions to close the continent’s digital inclusion gap.




Speaking on a panel at the Future of Digital Countries (FDC) Africa Regional Summit in Accra on the topic, Bridging Research and Practice: Women Leading Africa’s Digital Transformation at the Kempinski Gold Coast City Hotel, Ms Bolarin argued that evidence-led innovation is hard to achieve without stronger collaboration between industry and academia.


“Most research findings and reports sit on shelves in school libraries. To bridge the gap between research institutions and industry, we need a dynamic, two-way collaboration to inform each other. 


""Telecom companies have lots of anonymised data that can shape insights of research and, in turn, their research findings, when shared with the tech industry, can ensure digital inclusion solutions are more grounded in evidence and reality.”


She pointed to Telecel Foundation’s ‘Data for Good’ partnership, which provided anonymised mobility insights during national pandemics such as COVID-19 and the Akosombo dam spillage to inform public health guidelines.




On structural changes needed for women’s insights to influence national digital transformation, Ms Bolarin argued that Ghana’s digital agenda must be designed with deliberate gender representation at the policy-making level.


“There’s nothing to celebrate when it’s the first time a woman gets a position. It’s rather a call to action to open the door for other women. Until more women sit on policy boards, research councils, and strategy teams, our insights won’t shape national outcomes.”


Ms Bolarin outlined Telecel Ghana’s efforts to build a gender-inclusive digital workforce, citing policies and programmes that start at the basic education level to the workplace.


“Women make up 50% of the senior leadership team at Telecel Ghana. We are helping to correct the structural and cultural imbalances not just externally but internally as well, with supportive policies including the Reconnect initiative, which is designed to support women who have been out of work either for childbirth or personal reasons to reintegrate into the workplace,” she added.



Externally, Ms. Bolarin said Telecel Foundation’s GrowGirls in STEM and DigiTech Academy initiatives in upper primary and junior high schools ensure 70% female participation in robotics and coding programmes. 


At the tertiary level, the company’s Female Engineering Students Scholarship Programme (FESSP) has supported more than 100 female engineering students with financial aid, mentorship, and access to tech tools.


For entrepreneurs, Telecel introduced a Women in Business package last year, offering funding, insurance, training, networking, and market access to support female-led Small and Medium Enterprises.


Ms Bolarin emphasised that Ghana’s digital gender gap cannot be solved by the private sector alone. 




“Telecel is ready to collaborate with key stakeholders to build digital systems that are more inclusive and more relevant to Ghana’s digital future.”


The panel included Dr Azeb Tadesse, Deputy Director of Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles; Dr Olubunmi Ajayi, Chief Executive Officer of Maddison Pine; and Dr Maud Ashong Elliot, Lecturer, UPSA and President Internet Society Ghana Chapter. 


The Future of Digital Countries (FDC) Africa’s Regional Summit in Accra convened a broad spectrum of digital ecosystem stakeholders, including policymakers, telecom and tech executives, academic researchers, innovators and civil-society actors to discuss a shared vision for the continent’s digital future. 


Other panel discussions centred on strengthening digital governance and cybersecurity, building robust and interoperable digital infrastructure and ensuring inclusive digital systems for socio-economic growth

Office of Special Prosecutor has failed  Sam Okudzeto tears into Ghanas anti-corruption model,"Former President of the Ghana Bar Association, Sam Okudzeto, says the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) has failed to achieve the purpose for which it was created. 




He believes corruption remains widespread and visible, and the OSP has made no real dent in the problem.


Speaking on JoyNews’ PM Express on December 8, he said the starting point is to ask why the institution was set up and whether it has delivered. 


“Sometimes someone says it is not what you think you are entitled to, it is what you can give, but it should be. So you’re asking me this question. The question is simply this: why was the institution set up? Has it achieved its purpose?” he said.


When host Evans Mensah asked if the OSP had, in fact, achieved that purpose, Mr Okudzeto was direct. “I don’t think so. That is exactly the issue that I’m trying to drive here. He hasn’t achieved his purpose because the corruption is still on. I see it every day. 




""Everywhere you turn in every institution, you see it openly. They don’t even… they are not even afraid. People are no longer even afraid. You go there, and they demand money from you to do this for you, when you already paid.”


Asked if scrapping the OSP was the solution, Mr Okudzeto insisted the core problem is duplication of roles. He argued that the Attorney-General’s Department already has the mandate to prosecute all crimes, including corruption. 





“Yeah, I’m saying that that institution is not achieving its purpose. Because look at it this way, you have an attorney general’s department. Is that not correct? Yes, in that department, they have a civil section, and then they have a prosecutorial section. 


""This one is headed by the Director of Public Prosecution. The other one is headed by the Solicitor General. Now, what is the director of all prosecution supposed to do? He’s supposed to prosecute criminal offences which will include corruption, corruption-related related. 



""There is nothing which makes corruption anymore different from any other crime. We have a director of public prosecution, that is his job. Why do you create another institution to do the same job? That’s the whole issue.”


Evans Mensah pointed out that the OSP was designed as a special-purpose vehicle to deal only with corruption. 


But Mr Okudzeto countered that countries with special prosecutors only appoint them to tackle very specific, one-off problems. 


“You see, in other places where you have this special prosecutor, it means that there is a specific problem that has arisen, and you want that person to go there and solve that problem. You don’t create the whole institution for it, as we have done; if you like, you can go and search and ask where and where do we have that kind of institution? 




""You see, the Prime Minister of England, you know what his position was before? You know how he got the knighthood? He was the director of public prosecution. Justice D. F. Anang, who became the Speaker of Parliament, was also Director of Public Prosecutions.”


He aligned himself with those calling for the OSP to be scrapped and the Attorney-General’s office strengthened instead. 


“That is what should have been done. But I suspect that somebody thought that corruption was too rampant in the country, and therefore, to create an institution for that purpose was a good idea. And then, of course, you appoint an individual. Don’t forget, it’s just an individual you’ve appointed. 


""Then you are now trying to create an institution around that individual. What is the background of that? That’s the question I ask. What is his background of that individual? If I am going to try and select one of the top legal luminaries and say that I’m giving him that just a different thing.”




He warned that building institutions around untested individuals is risky. “I’m just saying that when you don’t train people to do a job, you think that creating institutions, particularly when they think it’s just an individual, it’s dangerous… It’s very, very dangerous.”

Israeli climate tech company pioneers eco-friendly lime,"In a significant stride towards decarbonising one of the world's most carbon-intensive sectors, Israeli climate tech company CarbonBlue has unveiled its groundbreaking technology to reduce emissions in the lime production industry.




The innovative solution was announced ahead of the Planetech week conference, highlighting the company's commitment to sustainable development and environmental rehabilitation.


CarbonBlue's EcoLime process offers a game-changing approach to lime production, utilising renewable energy to minimise emissions and optimise industrial operations. 


This cutting-edge technology has the potential to transform the industry, making it more environmentally friendly and sustainable.


L-R Mr. Adam Etzion, Marketing and Communications Manager; Dr. Noga Friedman Bishop, Vice President of R and D; and Mr Iddo Tsar, COO and Founder of CarbonBlue


This was disclosed by the CarbonBlue Marketing and Communications Manager, Mr Adam Etzion, when a delegation made up of PLANETech Investor Alliance, the most influential group of climate-tech investors in Israel, embarked on an interactive tour of the company.




The visit was to gather hands-on information about the company’s activities as part of PLANETech Week, currently taking place in the Middle East country.


The delegation paid a similar visit to three other startup companies, which included HomeBiogas, H2PRO, and Brenmiller Energy Tempo, where each of them made a presentation on their performance


According to Mr. Etzion, the company's connection to the desalination industry runs deep, with its R&D facility and first pilot project located within Kibbutz Maagan Michael's desalination plant.





CarbonBlue's AquaFix technology removes CO₂ from water, offering co-benefits to the core business of water-utilising facilities. 



This innovative solution supports diverse sectors and value chains, empowering industries to achieve sustainable growth through environmental rehabilitation. 


By integrating CarbonBlue's technology into desalination processes, facilities can reduce their carbon footprint, decrease energy consumption, and contribute to a more sustainable future.





The production of lime is a significant contributor to global CO₂ emissions, accounting for approximately 8% of total emissions.


CarbonBlue's EcoLime process addresses this issue by producing lime in an environmentally conscious manner and removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. 




The technology has far-reaching implications, enabling industries to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.


CarbonBlue's commitment to sustainability extends beyond its innovative technologies.


The company has installed a giant floating solar panel on a nearby fish pond to generate solar energy for its operations, reducing reliance on electricity and promoting renewable energy.





This approach demonstrates that climate mitigation doesn't have to mean degrowth but rather a shift towards more sustainable practices and resource management.




CarbonBlue is closely linked with the Israeli water desalination industry, with engineers from desalination backgrounds working together to provide meaningful benefits to the industry. 


The company's collaboration with Kibbutz Maagan Michael's desalination plant provides a core benefit for the community, showcasing the potential for integrated solutions that drive sustainable development.





CarbonBlue's innovative technologies and commitment to sustainability have positioned the company at the forefront of the climate tech industry. 


As the world transitions towards a more sustainable future, CarbonBlue's EcoLime process and AquaFix technology are set to play a significant role in reducing emissions and promoting environmental rehabilitation.




Organised by PLANETech—a non-profit joint venture between the Israel Innovation Institute and the Consensus Business Group—PLANETech Week (7–11 December 2025) is the flagship annual gathering of players within the global climate-tech ecosystem.





With over 1,000 active climate-tech startups, more than $9.5 billion raised since 2018, and over 500 multinational R&D centres, Israel has emerged as a superpower in deep-tech solutions for energy, water, agriculture, food, and mobility.





This year’s theme, “Inside Israel’s Climate Innovation”, will spotlight how Israeli ingenuity is delivering real-world answers to the climate crisis, answers that could transform Africa and the Global South.

"Critical moment to ramp up support for Ukraine, European allies say","European leaders have said ""now is a critical moment"" to ramp up support for Ukraine and put pressure on Russia to bring an end to the war.




Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in London on Monday to discuss the latest version of a peace plan, drafted between Ukrainian and US officials last week.


The European leaders said more work was needed to obtain security guarantees for Ukraine, as the US puts pressure on Kyiv to agree a swift deal with Russia.


Zelensky, who travelled on to Brussels to meet Nato officials, said that Ukraine would share a revised plan with the US on Tuesday.


Last week, Ukrainian officials spent three days with the US negotiating team in Florida pushing for changes to a US-backed peace proposal which has been widely considered favourable to Russia.




Answering questions from journalists after Monday's meeting in London, Zelensky said that the ""most certainly anti-Ukrainian points have been removed"" from the initial deal proposed in November.


But the Ukrainian president acknowledged that there were some outstanding concerns about ceding territory and a compromise had ""not yet been found there"".


The US has proposed that Ukraine pull its forces entirely out of eastern regions, which Russia has attempted to take by force, but has been unable to capture in full. In return, the US says Russia would withdraw elsewhere, and there would be a cessation of fighting.


But this is an unpalatable option for Zelensky, who refuses to reward Moscow for its aggression and who has repeatedly warned that Russia would use any foothold in the eastern regions to launch future assaults on Ukraine.



""Americans are inclined, in principle, to finding a compromise,"" Zelensky said on Monday.


He added that the issue of security guarantees - which Ukraine wants to ensure Russia would be deterred from carrying out future attacks in the event of a peace deal - had yet to be resolved.


A spokesperson for the UK prime minister's office said: ""The leaders all agreed that now is a critical moment and that we must continue to ramp up support to Ukraine and economic pressure on Putin to bring an end to this barbaric war.


""The leaders discussed the importance of the US-led peace talks for European security and supported the progress made,"" the statement said.




Leaders also ""underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, which includes robust security guarantees"", it added.


Ahead of the talks he hosted at Downing Street, Starmer said there needed to be ""hard-edged security guarantees"" in a peace deal for Ukraine.


Merz stated he was ""sceptical"" about some of the details of the potential plan coming from the US side. ""But we have to talk about it. That's why we are here,"" he added.


Following the meeting, France said work would be ""intensified"" to provide security guarantees for Ukraine.




There is nervousness in Kyiv and across Europe that the US could end its support of Ukraine over frustration with the slow progress of negotiations. ""We can't manage without Americans, we can't manage without Europe and that is why we need to make some important decisions,"" Zelensky said in London.


Although the White House has been pushing Kyiv and Moscow to swiftly agree to a multi-point plan to end the war, there has been little sign of a breakthrough.


A five-hour meeting between US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week failed to yield tangible results.


Those talks were followed by three days of discussions between Zelensky's chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov and his US counterparts in Miami, which resulted in vague but positive statements of ""progress"" from both sides.




However, on Sunday, Trump accused Zelensky of not having read the draft of the revised deal.


""I'm a little disappointed that President Zelensky hasn't yet read the proposal,"" he said, while insisting Russia's Vladimir Putin was ""fine with it"".


Almost simultaneously, Zelensky stated that he expected to be briefed on the negotiations by Umerov either in London or Brussels on Monday. ""Some issues can only be discussed in person,"" he said.


The talks in London were the latest attempt by Ukraine's European allies to carve out a role in the US-led efforts to end the war, which they fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.




Despite significant economic pressure and sustained battlefield losses, the Kremlin has shown little sign that it is willing to compromise on its key demands, including ruling out any future path to Ukraine joining the NATO military alliance.


Last week, Putin also restated his willingness to continue fighting until his forces take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, 85% of which is currently occupied by the Russian army.


The fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (pictured in August 2022) is a sticking point in negotiations to end the war, a US official said


As talks in the US and Europe continue, so does the war.


Between Sunday and Monday, a total of 10 people were killed, and 47 were injured as Russian forces attacked nine regions using drones, glide bombs and missiles.




Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Since then, thousands of civilians and soldiers have been killed or injured, with Ukraine's cities continuing to come under fire on a near-nightly basis.

"Burkina Faso plans to restore death penalty for treason, terrorism, espionage","Burkina Faso’s Council of Ministers has adopted a bill to restore the death penalty, targeting offences such as treason, terrorism and espionage, authorities said.




“The adoption of this bill is part of reforms ... to have a justice that responds to the deep aspirations of our people,” Minister of Justice Edasso Rodrigue Bayala said in a Facebook post late Thursday.


The death penalty was abolished in the country in 2018.


The bill has to be adopted by parliament and reviewed by the courts before becoming law.


Marceau Sivieude, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, called the move a “serious setback for human rights in Burkina Faso,” and alarming “in the context of the ongoing crackdown on political opponents, human rights activists and journalists in Burkina Faso.”




Since taking power in a 2022 coup, the West African country’s military leaders have launched sweeping reforms, including postponing elections that were expected to restore civilian rule and dissolving the country’s independent electoral commission.


Burkina Faso has increasingly silenced critical media outlets in recent years. It suspended the BBC and Voice of America radio stations for their coverage of a mass killing of civilians carried out by the country’s armed forces, as well as arrested three prominent journalists earlier this year.


The country is one of several West African nations where the military has taken over in recent years, capitalising on widespread discontent with previous democratically elected governments over security issues. The military government has been accused of human rights abuses and the detention of journalists critical of the government.


The landlocked nation of 23 million people is among the countries struggling with a security crisis in the arid Sahel region south of the Sahara in recent years. It has been shaken by violence from extremist groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.

Ivory Coasts incumbent leader Ouattara is sworn in for a fourth term,"Ivory Coast’s incumbent President Alassane Ouattara was sworn in on Monday for a fourth term after taking over 89% of the vote in an October election marked by low turnout and unrest.




“This vote is a choice for stability, peace, and development,” Ouattara said, after his government excluded main opposition figures from the election. 


Violence around the vote killed at least 11 people, and over 1,650 people were arrested, according to official figures.


“We are not in the business of telling people how to run their country,” Jacob Helberg, U.S. assistant secretary of state for economic affairs, told The Associated Press a day before the inauguration, adding that “ultimately, we think the Ivory Coast is a politically stable place that is growing quickly.”


Eleven African presidents also attended Monday’s ceremony in the West African nation.




Ouattara first came to power after winning a disputed election in 2010 against his predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo. 


Ouattara oversaw a referendum that changed the constitution in 2016, and in 2020 he said the amended constitution reset his time in office to zero, which his opponents rejected.


Supporters have credited Ouattara with restoring the economy in the world’s largest cocoa producer, while critics have accused him of tightening his grip on power.

Benin govt says short-lived coup left casualties on both sides,"The short-lived coup in Benin left “casualties on both sides” of the government forces and the mutinous soldiers, authorities said Monday, as security forces intensified the search for the coup leader who was on the run.




The military takeover attempting to overthrow President Patrice Talon, which lasted a few hours before authorities announced it had been foiled, was the latest in a series of recent coups across Africa — most following a similar pattern of disputed elections, constitutional upheaval, security crises and youth discontent.


In a statement detailing Sunday’s events, Government Secretary Edouard Ouin-Ouro said the mutinous soldiers attacked Talon around 5 a.m. before being “overwhelmed by the fierce resistance of the loyal soldiers.”


The government confirmed the involvement of Nigerian and Ivorian troops in helping to thwart the coup, saying the Nigerian military had “(used) its military aircraft, which immobilised some of the armoured vehicles.”


Authorities said that although several arrests have been made over the coup, its apparent leader remained on the run and was being hunted. Two senior military officers held hostage by those carrying out the coup had also been released, officials said. Authorities did not specify the number of casualties.




An ongoing investigation into the coup will “identify all the perpetrators and their sponsors, whoever they may be” and will assess the damage in the aftermath, Ouin-Ouro said in the statement issued after a high-level cabinet meeting chaired by the Benin leader.


How the coup unfolded


A group of soldiers calling themselves the Committee for Refoundation stormed the national television station on Sunday morning to announce the coup.


Led by Lt. Col. Pascal Tigri, eight soldiers appeared in a broadcast announcing the removal of Talon, the dissolution of the government and the suspension of state institutions.


Before the coup, Tigri was a member of Talon’s protection detail. As an artillery officer, he commanded a National Guard battalion between 2023 and 2025.



By Sunday afternoon, the coup was foiled by Benin’s military, supported by Nigerian air and ground forces, which launched attacks against fleeing coup participants.


Calm on Monday returned to Cotonou, Benin’s administrative centre, with soldiers on the streets.


Talon described the coup late Sunday as a “senseless adventure,” and said the situation was under control. He vowed to punish mutineers and ensure the safety of hostages, including some believed to be senior military officers. He didn’t disclose their identities, and it wasn’t clear how many were held.


The Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, said Sunday that it had deployed a standby force to Benin to help preserve democracy. The troops included personnel from Nigeria, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone. The size of the force was unclear.




A Nigerian government spokesperson said in a statement that Talon had requested Nigeria’s help. It wasn’t clear how many personnel or how much equipment had been deployed.


Regional challenge


Nigeria and the ECOWAS regional bloc hadn’t intervened in a member state since 2017, when it sent troops to Gambia to force then-President Yahya Jammeh to vacate power following his election loss.


The bloc, led by Nigeria, tried to intervene in Niger after the country’s 2023 coup. At that time, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu led the bloc. His threat to intervene if the junta didn’t restore the ousted democratic government resulted in a standoff between the bloc and three junta-led countries, and they later left the bloc.


Analysts say Nigeria has a strategic interest in defending its borders — which it shares with Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon — especially now, while it experiences a severe security crisis.




“The coup in Benin is one too many. Nigeria cannot afford to be encircled by hostile governments,” Oluwole Ojewale, a senior security researcher at Dakar-based Institute for Security Studies, told The Associated Press.


As West Africa battles a surge in coups, analysts say ECOWAS lacks consistency in its response. In Gabon and Guinea-Bissau, the bloc was less assertive, and it has watched some other leaders stay in office via constitutional changes.


“You can make the argument that Tinubu needed to show some strength in preserving democracy, but this now speaks to ECOWAS’ double standard,” said Cheta Nwanze, a partner at the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence geopolitical consultancy firm.


Despite a history of coups following its independence from France in 1960, Benin has enjoyed relative calm in the past two decades. The country is set to elect a new president in April, because Talon is set to leave office after a decade in power.

Trump to issue order creating national AI rule,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would sign an executive order this week that he said would create a single national rule for artificial intelligence, which the industry has said is necessary to override disparate laws passed by U.S. states.




The move would deliver a win for Big Tech companies that have cultivated close relationships with the White House, and likely draw consternation from both Democratic and Republican state leaders who have said they need the ability to protect state residents.


The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day. Sign up here.


""There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI... I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week. You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something,"" Trump said in a post on his social media site, Truth Social.


Trump did not provide details but Reuters reported last month that the U.S. president was considering an executive order that would seek to preempt state laws on AI through lawsuits and by withholding federal funding.




ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Alphabet, Google, Meta Platforms, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz have called for national AI standards instead of a 50-state patchwork of laws, arguing that these laws stifle innovation. The companies argue that the U.S. will fall behind China on AI development if states are allowed to regulate the technology.


And yet state leaders from both major political parties have stressed the need for AI guardrails. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, introduced legislation he said would create an AI bill of rights including data privacy, parental controls and consumer protections.


Other states have passed laws prohibiting the use of AI to create nonconsensual sexual imagery, banning unauthorized political deepfakes and seeking to prevent AI from being used to discriminate. California, home to several major AI companies, will require major developers to explain plans to mitigate potential catastrophic risks.


Trump last month called on Congress to add language blocking state AI laws to an upcoming defence bill. The proposal has faced pushback from Republican and Democratic state lawmakers and attorneys general.



""Congress can’t fail to create real safeguards and then block the states from stepping up,"" North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson, a Democrat, said at the time.


The Senate voted 99-1 against an effort to block AI laws this year after pushback from state leaders and consumer groups.

Alina Habba resigns after court disqualified her from being New Jerseys top prosecutor,"Alina Habba, US President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, has resigned as New Jersey's top prosecutor after a court battle over her eligibility to serve as US attorney for the state.




US Attorney General Pam Bondi accepted Habba's resignation on Monday, saying the court's ""flawed"" ruling made it ""untenable for her to run her office effectively"".


Habba's exit comes a week after a US appeals court found that she had been unlawfully serving as US attorney - a ruling likely to affect scores of criminal cases in the Garden State.


Bondi said Habba will remain at the justice department as a senior adviser and will seek further review of the decision, with hopes of reversal.


Trump selected Habba for the role of US attorney this year, but after a district court rejected her nomination, the Trump administration installed her in a role that allowed her to fill in on an acting basis.




The appellate judges last week said the temporary posting, which bypassed confirmation by the US Senate, violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.


In a statement posted to X, Habba said she decided to step down ""to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love"" in light of the court's ruling.


""But do not mistake compliance for surrender,"" she wrote, saying she will work as an adviser to Bondi for US attorneys. ""My fight will now stretch across the country.""


Bondi wrote on X that the judges ""should not be able to countermand the President's choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch's core responsibility of prosecuting crime"".



The attorney general praised Habba's record and said that during her run, the state capital of Newark saw a 20% reduction in crime and that the city of Camden experienced its first summer in 50 years without a homicide.


Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.


She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, when he was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction.


Before Habba took on the role of US attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as ""unwavering in her loyalty"" and a ""tireless advocate for justice"".




Several other US attorneys appointed by Trump have been found to be serving unlawfully, primarily because their appointments circumvent confirmation by the Senate - the arm of the legislative branch of US government that traditionally appoints US attorneys.


At the White House on Monday, Trump echoed Habba and Bondi's frustration with the ""blue slip"" - a process that allows home-state senators to signal whether they approval or disapprove of judicial nominees that was originally intended as a courtesy to ensure presidential collaboration.


""I can't appoint a US attorney that's not a Democrat,"" he said. ""What it means is, I guess I just have to keep appointing people for three months and then just appoint another one, another one. And it's a very sad situation. We're losing tremendous, we're losing a lot of great people.""


He said that seven attorneys will not be able to be US attorneys because of the blue slip.




Last month, another of Trump's personal lawyers, Lindsey Halligan, was disqualified from her post in Virginia because her appointment violated the statute governing interim US attorneys.


A federal judge in California also ruled in October that acting US attorney Bill Essayli had been serving unlawfully in the Central District of California.


In September, a Nevada judge issued a similar opinion regarding Sigal Chattah in that state, but paused her disqualification pending appeal.

Pay teacher allowances to improve student performance  Ntim Fordjour urges govt,"Former Deputy Minister of Education, Rev. John Ntim Fordjour, has urged the government to urgently release funds to the Ministry of Education and clear all outstanding teacher allowances, saying these steps are vital to improving student performance nationwide.




Speaking on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen show, Rev. Fordjour stressed that teachers must be properly motivated if the country expects stronger learning outcomes.


“The best course of action is that funding must be released to the Ministry of Education to drive outcomes in our education system. Teachers should also be paid their allowances,” he said.


He cautioned the government against blaming teachers for poor academic results, insisting that the sector needs collaboration, not confrontation.


Rev. Fordjour also called for deeper partnerships with mission schools, which he described as institutions that consistently produce some of the nation’s top-performing students.




“The government should work with teachers instead of blaming them for students’ poor performance. Rather than assigning blame, the focus should be on motivating teachers to help students succeed. 


""The government should also build positive partnerships with mission schools because they often have the highest-performing students,” he added.

19-year-old remanded on three charges,"A 19-year-old unemployed person has been remanded into prison custody on three charges by the Asante Abuakwa circuit court in the Atwima Nwabiagya South Municipality. 




Aaron Attah pleaded guilty to the charges of unlawful entry, attempted stealing and causing harm. 


He will reappear before the court presided over by Ms Rosemond Dodua Agyiri on December 18, this year. 


Presenting the facts of the case to the court, Police Detective Inspector Alexander Agbekpornu, said the complainant, Owusu Boakye Yiadom, was a Disc Jockey, residing in Nketia, while the convict resided at Adankwame near Abuakwa. 


He said, on December 02, this year, at about 11 hours, the complainant was on his way to work and upon reaching his mother’s house, heard some unusual noise in the house. 




The complainant became suspicious, went closer, checked, and saw Attah trying to open the door to the main room, so he stood outside waiting and watching. 


The complainant then saw the convict, who descended from the ceiling, trying to escape, so he rushed in to arrest him, but Attah stabbed his right shoulder and stomach with a knife, and he bled profusely. 


After that, the convict took to his heels but was chased, and with the help of some neighbours, he was arrested and handed over to the Asuofua police. 


The complainant was rushed to the Suntreso government hospital, but he was transferred to the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), where he was still on admission, receiving treatment. 



Prosecution said, in a caution statement, the convict admitted the offences. 


After further investigations, he was charged and brought before the court.

Legal Green Association launches scholarship scheme for law students,"The Legal Green Association (LGA) has launched a scholarship scheme aimed at supporting financially disadvantaged students at the Ghana School of Law.




The launch took place on Sunday, 7th December, 2025, at Maison Français, University of Ghana.


The event drew participants from the legal community, public service, and governance circles.


In her opening remarks, the LGA General Secretary, Emerentiana W. Alatinga, described the scheme as an important step for the Association, noting that its purpose is to give financially deprived students better access to legal education.


She expressed appreciation to individuals and groups who have supported the initiative.




The Founding Leader of the LGA and current CEO of Tema Oil Refinery, Edmond Kombat, Esq., commended the Association’s leadership for implementing the scheme.


He shared experiences from his own time at the Ghana School of Law and encouraged the LGA to ensure transparency and accountability in managing the fund.


Richard Nunekpeku, Esq., Deputy CEO of Goldbod, welcomed the initiative and urged students to pursue their ambitions with discipline and determination.


A Technical Advisor to the Commissioner-General of the GRA, Mrs Elsie Appau-Klu, Esq., described education and youth development as important long-term investments and urged responsible management of the scholarship fund.



A past leader of the LGA, Kabu Nartey, also acknowledged the efforts of the current administration in formalising the scheme.


He expressed gratitude to senior lawyers, including Edmond Kombat, Mr Edudzi Tamekloe, and Sammy Gyamfi, for their support during his tenure.


Abdul Fatah Maigah Mahama, Deputy Director-General of TVET, noted that many law students struggle financially and said the scheme would offer timely support.


Delivering the main address, Festus Matey traced the Association’s development since its formation in 2022.




He highlighted the LGA’s advocacy for the inclusion of professional law students in the Student Loan Trust Fund and ongoing efforts to secure pupillage placements with the Attorney-General’s Office, law firms, and public-sector legal departments.


He noted that the Attorney-General has offered internship opportunities for LGA members.


Matey described the scholarship scheme as the centrepiece of the LGA’s current initiatives, explaining that it aims to expand access, provide financial support, and strengthen mentorship for committed students.


In closing, Evans Mawunyo Tsikata, Head of Politics for the LGA, said the scholarship scheme aligns with the Association’s goal of ensuring that members are not deprived of legal education due to financial constraints.




He encouraged new members to uphold the Association’s values and said the LGA would continue working with state agencies, law firms, the SRC, and other partners to broaden professional opportunities for students.

Prince Harrys security in UK under review,"The Duke of Sussex's access to security when he visits the UK is under review, sources have told the BBC.




In May, Prince Harry lost a legal case to have his police protection reinstated when visiting the UK.


In a BBC interview after the ruling, he said it was not safe to bring his family back to the country of his birth because he could not guarantee their safety.


It is understood a Home Office review will now look at whether he should automatically receive full police protection on visits to the UK even though he is no longer a working member of the royal family.


Sources close to the prince say this level of security review is long overdue.




According to The Sun newspaper, the process for reassessing the duke's threat level is already under way and a decision is expected next month.


King Charles has only met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children once before.


He last saw his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.


Prince Harry's security was downgraded after he stepped back from frontline royal duties in 2020 and moved to the US with the Duchess of Sussex.



In his legal challenge earlier this year, he contested the decision-making process used by a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office.


Ravec had concluded that because Prince Harry was going to be an infrequent visitor to the UK, his security needs would be assessed on a case by case basis.


But in doing so, the duke's legal team argued that Ravec did not properly re-assess the threats he faced when considering his situation in 2020.


His lawyers had argued that he had been ""singled out"" for ""inferior treatment"", but the court ruling upheld that there had been nothing unlawful about how the decision had been reached.




A senior judge ruled that Prince Harry's ""sense of grievance"" over how the decision to alter his security was reached did not amount to a basis for a successful appeal.


That decision meant the duke's security remained outside the automatic, high level of protection which is provided for senior royals.


Speaking to BBC News in California shortly afterwards, Prince Harry said he was ""devastated"" at losing his appeal.


He also said any prospect of a return to the UK for him and his family was ""impossible"" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, adding: ""I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.""




At the time, Buckingham Palace said: ""All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.""


A government spokesperson said: ""The UK Government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.


""It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.""

"NACOC nabs 3 in connection with 1,158kg suspected cocaine shipment to Belgium","The Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC) has arrested three individuals in connection with a 1,158-kilogram consignment of a substance suspected to be cocaine, shipped from Ghana to the Port of Antwerp in Belgium.




The arrests, made on 4 December 2025, followed weeks of coordinated intelligence operations between Ghanaian security agencies and their Belgian counterparts, who intercepted the suspected narcotics upon arrival in Europe.


Officials say the seizure is among the largest international drug-related cases linked to Ghana this year.


According to NACOC, the three suspects are believed to have played key roles in preparing, documenting, and exporting the shipment, which was disguised as legitimate cargo. Preliminary investigations suggest the consignment may be connected to a wider transnational drug-trafficking network operating across multiple West African ports.


Belgian authorities reportedly alerted NACOC after detecting anomalies in the container, prompting a swift trace-back operation that led to the arrests.




NACOC says a full-scale investigation is ongoing to identify additional accomplices and determine the full extent of the network behind the attempted export.


The Commission reiterated its commitment to strengthening port surveillance and enhancing collaboration with international partners to combat drug trafficking.


It also urged freight operators, shipping agents, and the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities as Ghana steps up efforts to curb the trafficking of illicit substances.

Certiorari is not stay of execution: Amaliba defends Parliaments notification on Kpandai vacancy,"Former Director of Legal Affairs of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Abraham Amaliba, has clarified that a certiorari application filed at the Supreme Court does not prevent Parliament from acting on a court-ordered vacancy, insisting that such an application does not amount to a stay of execution.




Speaking on Joy FM’s Top Story on Monday, Mr. Amaliba explained that unless Parliament has been formally served with a motion for stay of execution, it remains legally empowered to notify the Electoral Commission (EC) of a vacant seat—in this case, the Kpandai Constituency.


“The certiorari application does not tie the hands of Parliament, because that is not a stay of execution. I don’t know whether Parliament has been served with the stay of execution before the certiorari application. So if what has been served on Parliament is just a certiorari application, that cannot tie the hands of Parliament,” he said.


His comment follows Parliament’s formal notification to the EC on 4th December 2025, declaring the Kpandai seat vacant in compliance with a High Court order for a re-run of the 2024 parliamentary election. The notification triggers the administrative steps needed for the Commission to organise the re-run.


The development comes after the defeated MP, Mathew Nyindam, filed processes at the Supreme Court—including a certiorari application—seeking to overturn the High Court’s ruling that nullified his election victory. 




Critics had argued that Parliament should have waited for the Supreme Court to determine the matter; however, Mr. Amaliba insists that only a stay of execution could have legally halted Parliament’s action.


When asked what would happen if the Supreme Court eventually grants the certiorari, Mr. Amaliba said that such a ruling would have no practical effect on the current situation.


“Well, there isn’t any seat available now,” he explained. “So if the certiorari is granted, then it is a victory which cannot be enforced.”

Paramount launches rival bid for Warner Bros Discovery,"Paramount Skydance has made another offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery as it seeks to trump a rival plan from Netflix to buy the company's studio and streaming networks.




Paramount, which is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, said it was making a direct offer to shareholders of $30 per share to scoop up the whole of Warner Bros, including its traditional television networks.


It said its proposal was a ""superior alternative"" to Netflix's, delivering more cash upfront to shareholders and greater prospect of approval by regulators.


President Donald Trump has said ""there could be a problem"" with Netflix's purchase, pointing to competition concerns given the size of the companies.


The hostile bid from Paramount, a smaller player than Netflix which is known for brands such as CBS News, Nickelodeon and Mission Impossible, is the latest twist in a saga that started a few months ago, when Paramount started submitting offers to buy Warner Bros.




That eventually prompted Warner Bros, owner of HBO and classics from Looney Tunes to Harry Potter, to formally open a bidding process.


Paramount had been seen by many on Wall Street as a strong suitor for Warner Bros, in part because the relationship between David and Larry Ellison, who is a Republican megadonor, and Trump was expected to help ease the approval process.


But Warner Bros declared Netflix the winner of that auction on Friday, announcing a deal that valued its studio and streaming networks, including HBO, at about $83bn, including its debt.


It said the sale would proceed after a planned spin-off of other parts of Warner Brothers' business, including CNN, into an independent company.



Paramount's offer values the entire company at $108.4bn, which it said was a better deal.Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is among the financial partners Paramount is working with as part of the deal, according to paperwork submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission.


Eithertakeover is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.


Analysts said Netflix's plan would likely raise concerns about dominance in streaming, while Paramount's proposal would prompt a review of the impact on advertisers and local television distributors, given the power of a combined company over sports and children's networks.


Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.




The president said over the weekend he expected to be involved in the approval process.


But he has offered little certainty about his views.


While noting potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up on Sunday, he also praised the streamer's bosses. Meanwhile on social media on Monday, he took aim at Paramount for a 60 Minutes interview that it aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.


In an interview with CNBC, Paramount chief executive David Ellison said he had had ""great conversations"" with Trump about the deal, while noting that he did not want to speak for the president.




Netflix is the biggest streaming company in the world, with more than 300 million subscribers. It said on Friday it believed the takeover would help supercharge its business and expressed confidence in winning approval from regulators.


But Wall Street analysts have long said they believe a Paramount-Warner Bros combination makes sense, giving the company the scale to compete against rivals such as Netflix and Disney.


It would build on Mr Ellison's purchase earlier this year of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio.


""Paramount ultimately needs this deal more than Netflix,"" said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, calling the Warner Bros assets simply ""nice to have"" for the streamer.




Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr Ellison talked up the benefits of his plan for the entire media industry, arguing that Netflix's takeover of Warner Brothers Discovery would give one firm too much power over actors and other players in the industry.


""It's a horrible deal for Hollywood,"" he said.


He also said he thought Warner Bros' plan to spin-off its traditional networks into an independent company would set them up to fail and ultimately prove a mistake for shareholders.


""I think [its shares are] going to be worth a lot less than people are claiming,"" he said.




Shares in Warner Bros were up more than 3% in midday trade on Monday, while Paramount shares were also up.


Shares in Netflix, however, dropped.

Investment in data production strengthens governance  Deputy Finance Minister,"Deputy Minister of Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, has underscored the importance of investing in quality data to strengthen good governance.




“We know that when we invest in data, we improve the quality of public expenditure, we empower citizens, we energise innovation, and we create opportunities for equitable and inclusive development,” he said.


The Deputy Minister said this at the inaugural 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users, and Enhancers, which also serves to commemorate the 2025 African Statistics Day.


The programme was on the theme: “Financing Innovations in Data and Statistics for Sustainable and Inclusive Development.”


 He said the country was moving from donor-reliant




financing arrangements toward a model grounded in national ownership and sustainable investment.


“I am proud to note that the 2026 budget allocates GH¢207 million to advance critical operations including rebasing GDP and CPI, completing key national surveys, and strengthening economic performance and price measurement,” he said.


The budget, he stressed, also supported the scaling of the Monthly Indicator of Economic Growth (MIEG), placing Ghana among a select group of countries using near-real-time data to manage the economy.


 This tool will enable policy responses up to 10 weeks faster than traditional quarterly estimates.



Mr Ampem said a major reform was the integration of administrative data systems using the Ghana Card’s unique identifier.


This innovation, explained, was projected to cut future census costs by over 70 per cent, while delivering continuous, high-quality population and sectoral data.


He said another transformative measure was the launch of Ghana in Numbers, a new annual, visual, globally benchmarked data publication designed to turn statistics into compelling narratives for the public and policymakers.


To reinforce this ecosystem, he said, the government was reviewing the Statistical Service Act to further strengthen the independence, authority, and global standing of the service.




He said without quality data, planning becomes speculative, policymaking becomes inefficient, and development outcomes become uneven.


“Data drives smarter investments. It ensures that public resources are directed where they are needed most,” he said.


He stated that Ghana had made remarkable strides in modernizing its statistical landscape.


“We delivered West Africa’s first fully digital Population and Housing Census, processing data three times faster than previous cycles.




“We have institutionalised the high‑frequency surveys that provide real‑time insights into welfare, labour market trends and business dynamics,” he said.


Dr Alhassan Iddrisu, the Government Statistician, said the theme reaffirmed that “nation becomes


what it measures, what it funds, and what it chooses to understand.”


“When we produce data well, fund it sustainably, and use it consistently, we strengthen institutions, protect the vulnerable, and open opportunities for every community,” he said.




Dr Wilfred Ochan, Co- Chair, GSSDP Group, said the forum showed the commitment of GSS to achieve its mandate of producing quality data.


He called for investment in the production of data, saying, “Data on its own is not informative unless it is credible, accessible, and put to good use.”

High Court ruling on Kpandai will stand unless overturned by Supreme Court- Berekum West MP,"The Member of Parliament for Berekum West, Dickson Kyere-Duah, says the decision by Parliament to notify the Electoral Commission (EC) of a vacancy in the Kpandai Constituency is simply a constitutional requirement and will remain in force unless a higher court reverses the ruling.




Speaking on the AM Show, he explained that the High Court’s decision ordering a re-run of the 2024 parliamentary election in Kpandai must be respected by all parties, including Parliament and the EC.


“This does not stop my brother Matthew Nyindam from pursuing his case at the Supreme Court,” he said. “If the verdict of the High Court is overturned at any point, it will stop the EC from proceeding to conduct the election. So for me, nothing new has happened.”


Kyere-Duah stressed that Parliament was only communicating the court’s directive to the EC, as mandated by law. He noted that if the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal delivers a contrary ruling, Parliament will similarly implement it without hesitation.


“A court decision will be respected by everybody,” he said, adding that “in the same vein, if an appeal court overturns the decision, the same will be implemented by Parliament.”




His comments come after the Parliamentary Service formally informed the EC of a vacancy in the Kpandai seat. 


The notification, dated 4 December 2025 and signed by the Clerk to Parliament, Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror, signals the official start of processes to conduct a re-run election.


The letter was issued in line with Article 112(5) of the 1992 Constitution, which requires the Clerk to Parliament to notify the EC whenever a parliamentary seat becomes vacant.


The re-run is expected to determine who ultimately represents the people of Kpandai in Parliament, following the annulment of the 2024 parliamentary election results in that constituency

"Ghanas public debate too emotional, not driven by data  Prof Bokpin","Economics professor Godfred Bokpin has criticised the quality of Ghana’s national conversations, arguing that far too many public debates are shaped by emotion rather than evidence. He says the country must urgently elevate the role of data in public policy, decision-making and everyday discourse.




Speaking at the 2025 Annual Forum for Data Producers, Users and Enhancers, Prof. Bokpin stressed that reliable data remains the single most important input for sound governance and economic management. According to him, countries can function without natural resources, but no nation can progress without solid data.


“As an academic, I value data more than gold or oil. Without data, nothing gets done. That is how important it is,” he told participants during a panel discussion.


He also noted that although the Ghana Statistical Service produces a wealth of information every year, much of it is ignored or underutilised. He urged policymakers, businesses and the public to integrate this data into planning, monitoring and evaluation processes.


“There is so much data harvested by the Statistical Service, yet many people think they only produce GDP figures,” he said. “The real question is: how often do we rely on data in our daily lives? How data-driven are we?”




Prof. Bokpin lamented that national discussions frequently resemble talk shows rather than evidence-based exchanges. He argued that greater reliance on data would reduce disputes on media platforms and temper emotionally charged debates.


“If we were driven by data as a country, there would be fewer disagreements, less emotion and probably fewer fights, because data simply speaks for itself,” he added.

Arthur Kennedy writes on President Kufuor,"Four score and 7 years ago, a child was born. He has been very consequential to Ghana, Africa and the world.




I read biographies a lot so even though I had interacted with President Kufuor quite a bit, I looked for a biography. From that, I learned that he had been an exceptional student at Prempeh College, where according to his biography, he picked up virtually every prize in sight.


After returning to Ghana after his education in UK, he joined politics at a young age. He served under Busia and Rawlings but his masterpiece, on the way to the Presidency, was his 1996 campaign, repeated in 1998.


He was under-resourced but he made up for his lack of resources with hard work and personal relations.


Indeed, it was Northerners who propelled him to victory in his primary campaigns. In 2007, during my ill-fated campaign, in home after home in the north, they showed me the beds or cots he slept on and recounted stories of midnight knocks on doors by Kufuor.




As President, he was humble and inclusive. A humble Ashanti! As he once said, ""Every party has factions and leaders must accommodate them"".


Wherever he went as President, doors opened, to him and for Ghana. And he strengthened institutions with good quality appointments. But his finest season may have been in his post-presidency.


He has been dignified, statesmanlike-- maybe a tad too quiet, formed a foundation and helped to establish APIMI. As he explained last September at a forum, public interest digital media combined with AI will bring Africa to the centre of global development.


Together with President Mahama, the Oldman will help give us and the youth the tools to keep Ghana as the gateway to Africa through this century.



Mr President, as they sing ""Di wo hene"" and you twirl around a bit, remember our last conversation and speak out more. And if Delay proposes, turn her down!


May God bless you with many more years of joy and health. Happy birthday!

IMANI files RTI request seeking details on new nationwide SIM registration,"Policy think tank IMANI Africa has filed a Right to Information (RTI) request seeking full disclosure on the government’s planned nationwide SIM registration exercise set to begin in early 2026. The group says the move is necessary to ensure transparency, legality, and data protection ahead of the rollout.




In a request submitted on Monday, December 8, 2025, to the Ministry of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, IMANI asked for documents covering the legal basis of the new registration regime, technical design, biometric verification systems, procurement records, and oversight arrangements. The request was received by the Minister’s secretary, the think tank confirmed.


IMANI said Ghanaians deserve clarity on how their biometric data will be collected, stored, and protected under the new system. It also raised concerns about governance, cost implications, and the role of private sector vendors expected to participate in the exercise.


The think tank cited Article 21(1)(f) of the 1992 Constitution and the Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), which guarantees public access to information held by state institutions. It said its request aligns with efforts “to promote accountability and ensure that the exercise is conducted in the public interest.”


IMANI’s submission asked the ministry to disclose the legal instruments authorising the new SIM registry, the architecture of the verification process, details of vendors selected, and any agreements governing the management of citizens’ data.




According to IMANI, the RTI application is a proactive step to safeguard transparency and protect user rights before the exercise begins. The think tank added that public trust depends on clear assurances that data-sharing protocols and privacy safeguards meet national and international standards.

"Bawumia will perform better in 2026 NPP primaries, his popularity has actually risen  Nana Akomea","Vice Chairman of the ‘Bawumia 2024 Campaign Team,’ Nana Akomea, says he is convinced that Dr Mahamudu Bawumia will record an even stronger performance in the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) upcoming presidential primaries than he did in 2023.




In an interview on Citi FM on Monday, December 8, Akomea argued that Dr Bawumia’s appeal within the party has grown significantly — and notably, without the influence of incumbency this time around.


He maintained that this expanded support base puts the former Vice President in a favourable position ahead of the January polls.


“Bawumia’s popularity has actually risen without incumbency, and that is why I keep saying he will do better than he did in 2023. It’s just a month away — you will see,” Akomea stated confidently.


The NPP will elect its presidential candidate on January 31, 2026. Dr Bawumia is one of five aspirants seeking to lead the party into the next general election.




The other contenders are former Assin Central MP Kennedy Agyapong, former Agriculture Minister Dr Bryan Acheampong, former Education Minister Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum, and former NPP General Secretary Kwabena Agyepong.

Ghana Education crisis deepens as WASSCE Results expose systemic gaps,"The provisional 2025 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) results, released by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), confront Ghana with a deepening crisis in secondary education. The catastrophic decline in core subjects, especially Core Mathematics and Social Studies, signals a failure to equip nearly half a million candidates with foundational knowledge. Only 48.73% of candidates achieved the minimum A1-C6 passes in Core Mathematics. These results confirm one of the poorest national performances recorded recently.




Catastrophic Core Subject Collapse


The data shows an alarming ""Great Collapse."" The outright fail rate (Grade F9) in Core Mathematics nearly quadrupled, skyrocketing from 6.10% in 2024 to 26.77% in 2025. Chillingly, ""nearly one out of every four students who sat for the exam failed the subject outright."" Similarly, the F9 rate for Social Studies almost tripled, jumping from 9.55% to 27.50%. Failure rates in English Language and Integrated Science also more than doubled.


This massive surge in failures is linked to a stunning fall in the crucial A1-C6 pass rate. Core Mathematics, the linchpin for many tertiary courses, saw its pass rate collapse by almost 18 percentage points. It plunged from 66.86% in 2024 to just 48.73% in 2025. The implications are stark: ""more than half of the candidates did not secure the grades required for tertiary admission."" The futures of 461,736 candidates are now in jeopardy.


Voices from the Classroom and Home




These numbers translate into real-life heartbreak. A female Senior High School student, speaking anonymously, attributed the lack of focus to the Free SHS policy. She admitted, ""The free SHS also contributes to the failure of the students."" She noted a lack of financial accountability meant students ""will not take his studies seriously.""


Educationist Professor Stephen Adei offered a critical diagnosis. He argued that the challenge's true source is at the basic school level. ""The main source of the problem happens at the basic school level before the secondary school,"" he stated. He cautioned that Ghana is ""almost producing illiterate people at the basic level,"" and warned, ""Unless we tackle a fundamental issue... these results will be the best we can hope for.""


The Ghana Education Service (GES), through its Public Relations Officer, Daniel Fenyi, offered a crucial, nuanced response. While confirming the 2025 results ""represent a true and credible reflection of students' academic performance"" and affirming close collaboration with WAEC in conducting the exams, Fenyi also admitted the severity of the decline was deeply concerning for the education system. He stated, for any genuine education system, ""this result is quite worrying,"" but stressed that the results are truly reflective of student capabilities: ""the results you see are a true reflection of the competencies of our learners.""


WAEC attributes Failure to Core Skill Gaps



John Kapi, WAEC's Head of Public Relations, provided insight into the failures on the JOY Super Morning Show. He stressed the decline ""does not reflect a deviation from the curriculum."" Instead, it ""indicates the need for strengthened teaching and student focus on practical problem-solving skills.""


Mr. Kapi detailed seven specific areas of Core Mathematics weakness. These included the inability to solve simple interest applications, translate word problems, and represent information in diagrams. He confirmed these topics were within the syllabus. Beyond mathematics, WAEC flagged a pervasive issue: candidates' reliance on ""social media diction and non-standard English"" in their answers. This revealed a broad decline in formal academic communication skills.


Political Fallout: Blame and Historical Context


The sharp decline has quickly become a political flashpoint. The Minority in Parliament issued a strong statement criticizing the current government's handling of the sector and the GES's official response. The caucus highlighted the dramatic drop in Core Mathematics from 66.86% in 2024 to 48.73% in 2025, which followed a period of ""consistent improvement from 2022 to 2024."" They contrasted the 2025 results with the much lower performance in 2016 (e.g., Core Mathematics at 33.12%), arguing that the previous government had successfully improved learning outcomes.




The Minority also directly challenged the GES's attempt to attribute the poor performance partly to enhanced invigilation, describing the explanation as ""unprofessional and unethical."" The caucus questioned, ""Could it be a reason for the poor performance?"" They stressed that while invigilation must protect integrity, it ""should not, and must not put fear in the candidates"" as this can negatively affect performance.


Systemic Context: Infrastructure and Free SHS


While WAEC focuses on student skills, analysts point to systemic flaws. Cletus Seidu Dapilah, Member of Parliament for Jirapa, cited ""inadequate and uneven distribution of teachers across basic schools."" He noted that weak foundations lead to poor secondary school performance.


Experts demand a data-driven approach. Dr. Peter Anti Partey, Executive Director of IFEST, urged an end to assumptions. He stressed, ""We should ask the Ministry of Education to let us know which schools are pulling the national averages down."" He asked what interventions the ministry would provide.




The Free SHS policy is widely debated. While increasing enrollment, stakeholders cite overstretched school resources and overworking of teachers. They also note reduced student motivation due to a lack of parental financial investment.


Universities hold the Line on Admission Standards


The University of Ghana signaled that academic rigor will not be compromised. Prof. Gordon Awandare, the Pro Vice Chancellor, stated the university ""will not lower its admission cut-off points for the 2025/2026 academic year.""


Prof. Awandare explained the rationale. ""At the University of Ghana, every year, we have many more students making the cut-off but not getting the opportunity to be admitted,"" he said, citing limited space. He stressed that standards cannot be compromised. The message to struggling students is difficult: ""We will advise that if they really want to come to Legon, they should resit some of the papers and improve their aggregates and try again.""




Integrity Crisis Tarnishes Results Release


The academic slump was worsened by a severe ""integrity crisis."" The provisional results were marred by an unprecedented crackdown on malpractice. The Ghana Examinations Committee approved severe sanctions against thousands of students and dozens of personnel.


Specifically, 6,295 candidates had subject results annulled for bringing unauthorized materials. The entire results of 653 candidates were canceled for possessing mobile phones. A deeper rot was revealed. Results for candidates from 185 schools were withheld for suspected collusion.


Most damning is the criminal involvement. A total of 35 persons, including 19 teachers, faced legal action. WAEC confirmed that 19 of those individuals have already been arraigned before court and convicted to fines or prison terms. This sent a strong message against complicity. The convicted teachers' names will be given to the Ghana Education Service for further disciplinary action.




Moving Forward: A Call for Urgent Reform


The 2025 WASSCE results are an unavoidable indictment of Ghana's secondary education. The findings show a significant disconnect between teaching methods and the practical skills required for success. The dual crises—high failure rates and widespread malpractice—demand an urgent national response.


For Ghana, striving to build a skilled workforce, the fact that most high school graduates are deemed unfit for university raises fundamental questions about national development. Educational stakeholders must use this sobering data. The challenge is to implement measurable reforms, bridge the critical skills gap, and restore trust in the examination process.

"NAIMOS ramps up Eastern Region clampdown, shuts major galamsey sites on Akyem Oda stretch","The National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) has reinforced its relentless offensive against illegal mining, completing another high-impact operation across the Eastern Region on Sunday, 8 December 2025.




The latest sweep, which spanned more than 12 hours, underscored government’s growing determination to halt the destruction of forest reserves and water bodies.


From dawn until late evening, NAIMOS operatives conducted coordinated patrols in the Atiwa West District and the Birim Central Municipality—two areas increasingly plagued by persistent galamsey activity.


During the mission, the task force discovered several active illegal mining sites and moved swiftly to neutralise the machinery driving the devastation.


A major breakthrough occurred along the Akyem Akropong corridor, where officials uncovered an extensive roadside mining enclave hosting four excavators and five washing plants.




Two of the excavators were found fully operational, prompting officers to remove their monitors and control units on the spot to render them unusable. The remaining two machines had already been partially stripped by illegal miners attempting to evade detection.


At approximately 16:10 hours, a second discovery was made in Akyem Oda within Birim Central. There, the task force disabled another excavator stationed directly beside the main road.


In total, three excavators were fully immobilised across both locations. The machines were left on-site, as the operation could not secure low-bed transport for evacuation.


Environmental assessments conducted during the raid painted a grim picture. Vast portions of land—estimated at more than four acres—had been scarred by deep, contaminated pits.



Some of the water-filled craters stretched as wide as 200 metres and sank about eight feet deep, posing immediate dangers to nearby streams, farmlands and residents.


NAIMOS intelligence suggests that illegal miners continue to adapt their tactics, often withdrawing briefly during enforcement activities and repositioning equipment only a short distance away.


This pattern, according to officials, reinforces the need for sustained pressure rather than isolated raids.


Nonetheless, NAIMOS reports that its stepped-up visibility and rapid mobilisation strategy are rattling galamsey operators across the region.




Many miners are said to be abandoning sites mid-operation, interrupting supply chains and weakening the networks that facilitate illegal gold production.


The Secretariat maintains that its work is far from complete. With critical rivers such as the Birim and Ayensu still heavily threatened, NAIMOS says prolonged field deployment remains essential.


It has reiterated that illegal mining is not only an attack on the environment but a severe public health hazard, contaminating food and water sources with dangerous chemicals.

Prof. H. Kwasi Prempeh urges constitutional overhaul to fix OSP challenges,"Executive Director of the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana), Prof Henry Kwasi Prempeh, is urging a full constitutional review to resolve the persistent controversies surrounding the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), warning that incremental fixes will not save the institution.




Speaking on Monday, December 8, Prof Prempeh stressed that the impasse facing the OSP goes beyond administrative shortcomings and requires a deeper structural intervention.


According to him, attempts to patch the system through minor reforms or extended court battles will only delay an inevitable collapse.


“The problem we’re facing now calls for a constitutional solution. Basically, that is how we can resolve this impasse,” he said, cautioning that the OSP could eventually fade into irrelevance if fundamental issues are not addressed.


He added that renewing the institution’s legal foundation would offer a more permanent fix than trying to “renovate around the problem,” noting that other countries have successfully redesigned their anti-corruption architecture and Ghana can do the same.




“If we’re serious about solving the problem, there’s no shortage of innovative ideas to deal with it. There are comparative models around; we can innovate our own,” he remarked in an interview on Channel One TV, urging policymakers to consider bold and transformative reforms.

"NYA CEO Osman Ayariga highlights need for skilled, disciplined Yango couriers at 2025 Conference","The CEO of the National Youth Authority (NYA), Osman Ayariga, has praised Yango Ghana for its growing role in transforming youth employment in the country.




He described the company as “a functioning public–private development mechanism” rather than merely a transport platform.


Speaking at the 2025 Yango Partner Conference, Mr Osman Ayariga commended the ride-hailing and delivery service for creating opportunities that align with Ghana’s national youth development agenda.


The event brought together Ningo-Prampram MP, Samuel Nartey George, Yango Ghana Country Manager Emmanuel Koduah, government representatives, partners, riders, drivers, and stakeholders from across the digital mobility ecosystem.





Reaffirming the mandate of the NYA under Act 939, Mr Osman Ayariga noted that 2025 has been declared a year of “Heightened Youth Engagement and Economic Activation.” 




He highlighted major initiatives—including the nationwide Youth Conference themed “Igniting Potential; Inspiring Change” and the National Apprenticeship Programme targeting 10,000 young people this year and scaling up to 100,000 by 2026.


“These are not symbolic actions,” he emphasised. “We are building structural solutions to unemployment through technical, digital, and entrepreneurial training.”


Positioning Yango as a central player in youth economic empowerment, Mr Osman Ayariga outlined three pillars behind the platform’s effectiveness:


• Technology & Access: Digitisation of transport and courier services previously dominated by the informal sector.• Local Enterprise Growth: Strengthening MSMEs operating in transport and logistics.• Youth Employment: With over 70% of riders and drivers under age 35, Yango has become a gateway to income, financial identity, discipline, and business skills.



“For many young people, Yango is a classroom on wheels,” he said. “It teaches time management, customer service, accountability, and entrepreneurship.”





Mr Osman Ayariga reiterated government’s commitment to modernising the transport sector, especially the commercial motorcycle and tricycle industry. 


He confirmed that the state is finalising a regulatory framework to legalise and formalise okada and pragyia operations.


The policy will require riders to be at least 21 years old, acquire commercial licenses, undergo mandatory training, operate from designated stations, and meet strict safety requirements, including certified helmets with identification numbers.




He noted that beyond transportation, Yango’s delivery services now support Ghana’s expanding e-commerce sector, enabling restaurants, online sellers, and small businesses—many youth-led—to scale operations.


The NYA CEO emphasised that government’s goal extends beyond job creation and aims to build youth-owned enterprises.


“We don’t want young people to remain riders forever,” Mr Osman Ayariga said. 


“We want them to own fleets, build courier companies, and grow logistics businesses. Yango’s top-performing partners already demonstrate that this pathway is possible.”




To advance this shared mission, Mr. Osman Ayariga, announced the Authority’s readiness to collaborate with Yango on Advanced rider and driver training, Entrepreneurship and financial literacy and Access to credit and asset financing for high-potential partners. 





“Our mission is simple,” he stated. “Every hardworking young Ghanaian deserves a pathway to dignity, stability, and long-term economic growth.”


He concluded by commending Yango’s leadership and encouraging the platform’s riders, drivers, and partners to remain dedicated to building Ghana’s digital future.


“You are not just transporting people and parcels—you are carrying this nation into its digital future,” Mr Osman Ayariga said.




“May God bless your efforts. May God bless Yango. And may God bless the youth and the Republic of Ghana.”

"Ace Ankomah calls for merger of OSP, DPP, and EOCO to build a truly independent prosecution system","Private legal practitioner Ace Anan Ankomah has outlined a set of reforms he believes are necessary to secure the independence and effectiveness of Ghana’s anti-corruption framework.




He is proposing that the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), and the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) be consolidated into a single, autonomous prosecutorial authority.


His comments come as public and parliamentary debate intensifies over whether the OSP should be abolished or restructured.


Speaking on Channel One TV on Monday, December 8, Mr Ankomah said the ongoing controversy should be a catalyst for a broader overhaul of the country’s prosecutorial architecture.


He called for a constitutional review of Article 88(3) and (4), which anchor prosecutorial powers within the Attorney-General’s office, arguing that the system has struggled to deliver justice in complex corruption and economic crime cases.




“In my view, Parliament passing the OSP Act is the biggest concession that, when it comes to corruption and corruption-related offences, the AG’s office has not done well,” he said.


Mr Ankomah noted that economic and financial crimes require specialised expertise and that accused persons often mount strong, technical legal defences that the current system is not well-equipped to handle.


To remedy this, he recommended marrying the anti-corruption drive behind the OSP’s creation with the institutional stability offered by the DPP, while drawing on EOCO’s investigative capacity.


This, he argued, would form a single, politically insulated entity capable of handling high-stakes criminal prosecutions.



“We cannot trust any government with criminal prosecutions because we see that it favours their friends,” he stressed, adding that only a fully independent authority would command public confidence and deliver justice impartially.

Mahama to receive final Bawku peace mediation report on December 11,"President John Dramani Mahama is set to receive the final report on the Bawku peace mediation process on Thursday, December 11, 2025, at a ceremony scheduled for the Jubilee House.




The presentation marks a significant step toward consolidating national efforts to resolve the long-standing tensions in Bawku and its neighbouring communities.


The report represents months of mediation work led by the Asantehene, His Majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, whose leadership has been central to the broader national reconciliation agenda.


According to officials, Thursday’s ceremony will underscore the shared commitment of traditional leaders, state institutions, civil society groups, and international partners to fostering unity and long-term stability in the conflict-prone area.


The event, expected to begin at 10:00 a.m., will bring together senior government officials, the mediation committee, and invited dignitaries.




Traditional authorities and key stakeholders involved in the peace efforts are also expected to attend.

KIC Fellow wins National Best Youth Farmer award,"Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC) has celebrated the remarkable achievement of Robben Asare, a KIC Fellow (2019), who has emerged as the National Best Youth Farmer Award winner at the 2025 National Farmers’ Day Celebration




After participating in the KIC program in 2019, the Fellow was inspired by the training, mentorship, and business development support received through KIC. 


This foundation ignited his journey into large-scale plantation farming, with a key focus on rice, mango, and other crop production.


Through consistent mentorship, direction, and the practical agribusiness training model of KIC, he has transformed his vision into a thriving agricultural enterprise. 





His dedication to sustainable farming practices has also earned him the Best Agroforestry Award in 2019, further cementing his place as a leading young agripreneur in Ghana.




This achievement is a clear demonstration of KIC’s long-term impact in equipping young people with the right skills, knowledge, and support systems to succeed in agriculture. 


It reflects how KIC’s fellowship and youth-centred programs empower young innovators to move from learning to large-scale production and national recognition.


KIC congratulates this outstanding Fellow for making the nation proud and continues to celebrate all young people who are redefining agriculture through innovation, resilience, and purpose.

"Nana Akomea refutes claims of selling STC land, says allegations are politically driven","Former Managing Director of the State Transport Company (STC), Nana Akomea, has strongly denied allegations that he sold off portions of the company’s land during his time in office, describing the claims as baseless and politically motivated.




Speaking on Citi FM on Monday, December 8, 2025, Mr Akomea said no STC property was disposed of under his watch, insisting that those seeking to associate him with any land transactions were peddling falsehoods.


According to him, it was rather the National Democratic Congress (NDC) administration that engaged in the sale of STC lands more than a decade ago when the company was struggling financially.


He recalled that around 2010, approximately four acres of STC land in Takoradi were sold to Melcom, and that even the Managing Director’s official residence at Ridge was disposed of, forcing him to secure private accommodation when he later assumed office.


“They are accusing the wrong person. The only government that sold STC land was the NDC. They offloaded about four acres in Takoradi to Melcom. They even sold the MD’s bungalow at Ridge, so when I became MD, I had to find my own place,” Akomea explained. “I haven’t sold even a single foot of STC land.”




He added that another portion of land near the STC headquarters was sold to a company called BCL long before he took over leadership.


Mr Akomea maintained that the accusations against him were misleading and urged the public not to be swayed by politically charged narratives.
