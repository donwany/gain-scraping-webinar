Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Let's support EC to conduct credible elections!,"The pledge by the
Electoral Commission
(EC) to Ghanaians that it will conduct itself in truth and integrity and organise fair, credible, transparent and peaceful elections come December 7, 2024, and gives the assurance that, We will not let you down is a life-saving promise.
Since 1992, when party politics was reintroduced in the country after 11 years of military rule, this promise has been given by the EC every year and in spite of some issues raised by certain political parties and individuals, to a large extent, this has always been upheld.
Therefore, the Ghanaian Times believes that all the stakeholders in this years elections would play their respective roles for the country to once again acquits itself as a place where peace and tranquillity are treasured, a place where the noise is made but at the end of the day the dust settles.
The sages say Well done is better than well said.
This is to tell the EC that much controversy has been created around it and it would take the free and fair conduct of these elections to prove its integrity to the whole world that it is really the credible electoral referee that the whole world knows it to be.
After all, all things being equal, elections are about the opportunity given to the people to express their will as to who should govern them at a particular period and so any attempt to undermine that will to choose is a subversion of democracy.
Even though the EC is an institution, it is made up of people who have political affiliations as other citizens but it can be indisputably said that over the years, the commissioners leading the EC have proven themselves to be objective, fair, and men and women of integrity.
Such conduct is what has stemmed electoral violence in the country and earned it the accolade a beacon of hope with regard to the growth of democracy in Africa.
As in past election years, this year too calls for the best decisions and actions that respond to the exigencies of the day to ensure victory for the whole country and for peace and unity to continue to reign in the country.
One of such decision and action is for the EC to take a stance to have a listening ear even if it knows very well that something being said about it is false.
Let the EC give every accuser the benefit of the doubt to prove its case or get to the point of the accuser swallowing his or her words.
The EC should also stick to the notion that even though there has not been large-scale electoral violence in the country before, the isolated cases over the years indicate that any careless conduct on its part can spell doom.
While we plead with the EC to conduct itself well as it has promised, we also appeal to all the stakeholders in this years elections, particularly the political parties and the die-hard supporters to have cool heads.
The parties should do the needful in terms of having well-orientated supporters to monitor the voting and the counting of the ballots, not people who would cry foul where there is no need to.
We also appeal to security personnel to prevent ballot box snatching and other electoral vices, as well as ward off party members whose actions can spark controversy.
The media too should be circumspect in their report about the election in order not to incite people to violence.
To the citizens, particularly the voters, we say after voting, leave the polling station and come back only to observe the counting of the ballots if you so wish.
Let everyone in the country conduct themselves well before, during, and after the elections for peace in the country to prevail and for the whole world to once again say, Well done, Ghana.
The benefits of violence-free elections in Ghana are clear  peace, unity, more investment, and progress.",,Editorial, 24 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-s-support-EC-to-conduct-credible-elections-1952247
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Curb air pollution to boost public health,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called for concerted efforts among stakeholders to curb the increasing levels of air pollution in the Greater Accra Region to protect public health.
Unfortunately, the EPA has not been specific as to who these stakeholders are, but the Ghanaian Times can guess some of them, using information on the causes, management, and regulation of air pollution.
Generally, air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air.
These particles (aerosols) and gases can come from food joints, vehicle truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes, and wildfires.
In Ghana and, for that matter, the Greater Accra Region, poor air quality is mainly caused by cooking using wood and charcoal, improper disposal of both solid and liquid waste, road transport, slash-and-burn methods of farming, open waste burning, energy generation, accidental fires, and industry.
Thus, the stakeholders include regulators like EPA itself, the Metropolitan Municipal and District Assemblies (MMAs); companies and individuals that own vehicles; farmers, factories, markets, chop bars, and restaurant operators, as well as members of the general public; and waste management companies like Zoomlion.
In Accra, sometimes one wonders why refuse gathered at the markets and elsewhere are left to stink before it is collected.
Besides, there are places in Accra such as Achimota Old Station, precisely the EPP Bookshop area, which stinks because food vendors there pour liquid and solid wastes into the gutters around.
Once the stakeholders are identified, it becomes easier to prompt them to be careful with and about their activities, actions, and inaction which pollute the air such as refusing to fix faulty exhausts that emit thick smoke into the atmosphere.
This reminds us of the police too being stakeholders in dealing with air pollution, particularly in road transport.
Sometimes, some stakeholders discount certain acts as insignificant but at the end of it all, their effects are serious health risks.
Think of residents who throw refuse, even food leftovers, rotten protein products, and dead animals, into drains.
Since air pollution continues to fuel health challenges, there is really the need for the EPA and the MMDAs to bring in the required interventions.
Such interventions, obviously, are meant to ensure that people breathe in quality air.
Therefore, the call by the EPA for air quality management plans should be taken seriously by all those the Ghanaian Times would describe as frontline stakeholders  the Government and its agencies like the EPA, the MMDAs, and the Public Health Department of the Ghana Health Service.
Luckily, there is the Breathe Accra initiative and its Clean Air Fund (CAF) to support the 15 Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies in Accra to develop Air Quality Action Plans.
The Breathe Accra initiative is a project aimed at empowering communities in the Greater Accra Region to combat air pollution and climate emission.
It is expected that through air quality management activities, the MMDAs would be able to increase awareness, knowledge, and understanding of air quality among decision-makers, stakeholders, and members of the public to help rein in air pollution in the Greater Accra Region.
Hopefully, the Breathe Accra initiative will be a success that can be replicated in other regions where air pollution is a serious problem.",,Editorial, 20 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Curb-air-pollution-to-boost-public-health-1951699
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Make LEAN attract similar projects to conserve countrys biodiversity,"It is good news that there is a formal private effort in the afforestation drive in the country.
In 2020, the Landscape Environmental Agility Across the Nation (LEAN) project was launched.
LEAN is a four-year project funded by the European Union (EU)s flagship Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+) initiative and aims to conserve biodiversity, build climate resilience, and reduce emissions from land-use changes in the savannah, high forest, and transition zones of the country.
Besides, it helps local farmers to improve their livelihoods.
As envisaged and scheduled, the LEAN has been implemented on the ground by a consortium of four local and international NGOs with expertise in these challenging fields, namely the Rainforest Alliance, World Vision Ghana, Tropenbos Ghana, and EcoCare Ghana.
The project seeks to address three structural barriers that have historically hindered efforts by governments, civil society organisations, and the private sector to halt land degradation and deforestation through the uptake of landscape approaches.
It is said that although there is growing recognition of the importance of landscape approaches in addressing sustainability challenges, there is still a lack of effective tools, resources, and incentives to drive aligned action at the expected scale.
It is on the basis of this that the LEAN project sought to work alongside all stakeholders to mobilise and effectively deploy resources and tools that would support targeted sustainability interventions.
Set to end on October 31, 2024, the LEAN focused on the Savanna, high forest, and transitional zones of Ghana by supporting local farmers in improving their livelihoods.
It has more than 5,000 beneficiaries currently.
The initiative encourages smallholder farmers to adopt more sustainable farming and forest management practices, with added market incentives to diversify rural income opportunities.
So far, more than 600,000 tree seedlings have been planted across 13 communities in the transitional zones of the Bono East and Ashanti regions in the last four years to restore degraded forest areas.
The EUs GCCA+ funded the $5-million afforestation drive.
The Ghanaian Times sees the three-day verification visit last week by the four consortium partners  ECOCare Ghana, Tropenbos Ghana, Rainforest Alliance, and World Vision Ghana  to the beneficiary communities as an evaluation undertaking since the project has almost come to an end.
It is hoped that the visit can affirm the accomplishment of the targets set or otherwise, it would point out whatever is left to be done so that at the end of it all, it will be celebrated and those behind it hailed as having contributed to the governments efforts in conserving the countrys biodiversity, enhancing climate change resilience, and reducing carbon emissions from land use.
It is everyones hope that the Landscape Management Boards (LMBs) formed to take over the running of the project when it folds up would not let the country down.
Hopefully, they would discharge the duties such that other development partners would come in to initiate similar projects in other parts of the country.
The EU and the Rainforest Alliance, World Vision Ghana, Tropenbos Ghana, and EcoCare Ghana in particular, as well as others behind the LEAN project, deserve all the commendation for, undoubtedly, seeing to the successful end of the project they launched in 2020.",,Editorial, 19 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Make-LEAN-attract-similar-projects-to-conserve-country-s-biodiversity-1951517
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: ECOWAS food donation timely but...,"The country must be grateful to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for its food donation.
Under its Regional Food Security Reserve programme, the regional bloc yesterday handed over 500 metric tonnes of cereals to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA).
The cereals made up of 4,327 bags of maize, 2,015 bags of sorghum, 200 bags of millet, and 3,458 bags of rice, are to be distributed as food grants to eight regions in Ghana experiencing drought-disrupting crop production.
The beneficiary regions are Northern, Upper East, North East, Savannah, Upper West, Bono, Bono East, and Oti.
In recent weeks, it has, for instance, been reported that the Upper West Region is facing a severe crisis as a prolonged drought has caused crops to wither.
The ECOWAS donation did not come by accident as the Regional Food Security Reserve (RFSR) was created in 2013 by a Supplementary Act to the revised ECOWAS Treaty, as usual, with clear objectives.
The RFSR is a regional solidarity mechanism for Member States to improve the response to food and nutrition crises at the local, national, and regional levels; reduce dependence on international aid; and promote a storage system geared towards emergency response.
The history of the RFSR has its roots in the food crises that emerged in the 1980s in West Africa, with the severity in the Sahel countries like Mali and Chad.
If nothing at all, since natural forces can derail crop production at any time, all ECOWAS countries should have learned to embrace the third objective of the RFSR, which is promoting a storage system geared towards emergency response.
This is where the Ghanaian Times thinks successive political administrations of this country have failed the people.
Receiving the ECOWAS donation yesterday, the Minister of Food and Agriculture,
Bryan Acheampong
, made a plea for an additional 10,000 tonnes of the cereals to help strengthen the resilience of populations affected by the difficult food situation.
The plea is not the problem but his pledge that in order to store the foods, the government would build a 100,000-tonne capacity silo in each region to store grains yearly to cushion farmers during the dry season.
If the Ghanaian Times got him right, there is only an 80,000 metric tonne-capacity warehouse existing in the country, and as the minister himself testifies to it, this is insufficient, hence the need to build 100,000-tonne silos or warehouses for grain reserves in every region of the country.
It is an open secret in the country that the politicians ignore providing certain facilities until crisis time when they bring them in as interventions to score political marks.
This is a poor approach to national development and service to the people, particularly the vulnerable who would have no one to turn to for help when particular crises erupt and affect them.
There are less than three months to elections and it shouldnt surprise anyone that the pledge to build silos can be a campaign promise.
The countrys managers should be proactive rather than adopting the fire-fighting approach to solving problems, which rather exposes their negligence, ineptitude, insensitivity, carelessness, and all the related negative attitudes toward their duties and the people they should serve.",,Editorial, 18 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-ECOWAS-food-donation-timely-but-1951312
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: CRIs new vegetable varieties hope for food security,"Two new varieties of tomato and the varieties of okra and amaranth (locally known as alefu) developed by researchers at the Crop Research Institute (CRI) of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) give hope for ensuring food security in the country.
This is because the researchers assert that the new varieties have high yields and can withstand drought and other climate change conditions in the country.
It is the hope of the Ghanaian Times that the researchers would extend their work to other crops like fruits and carbohydrates.
It is clear climate change conditions are catching up with the country and going to undermine food production among other impacts.
For instance, over a month ago, there were media reports that food shortage looms in the Upper West Region because the region is facing a prolonged drought.
The second reason why the researchers must extend their work to other food crops is the rapid growth of the countrys population, which implies that there would be more mouths to feed in no time.
Just analyse the fact that in 1970, the countrys population was 8.5 million; 1980, 11.87 million; 1990, 15.45 million; 2000, 19.67 million; 2010, 25.57 million; 2020, 32.18 million; and currently (mid-year 2024), the population is estimated at 34. 43 million.
Meanwhile, the growth of communities has reduced the size of the land available for farming in years past, when the land was naturally fertile and far in excess of demand.
Today, the pressure on the land means it has become infertile and needs to be fertilised for optimum yields.
Besides the land is dwindling in size and has become infertile, the demon called galamsey continues to devastate it.
All this means the state must be proactive in finding the antidotes to the imminent national food shortage in the near future.
Clearly, the antidotes include the development of crop varieties that can give more yields on a small land.
This means even though the development of new food varieties is not new in the world, the CRI researchers have rekindled the need for the country to do all it can to nip in the bud any possibility of food shortage in the country.
Imagine that domestic demand for fresh tomatoes in the country stands at 1.2 million metric tonnes per year, but local farmers are able to produce only 30 percent of the quantity.
Clearly, food shortages result from production issues, which include the unavailability of irrigation systems and lack of inputs like fertiliser and or their unaffordability.
Therefore, the government must take seriously the call to focus on irrigation farming to ensure all-year production of all manner of food crops to meet local consumption.
The appeal from farmers to the government to reduce the cost of fertilisers and pesticides must also be seriously considered.
It is everyones expectation that the project under which the CRI researchers are working will be successful as it has prospects to combat threats posed by climate change, which affect vegetable production and hopefully, one day other crops will also be protected from negative climate change effects.
This can enormously ensure food security in the country.",,Editorial, 17 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-CRI-s-new-vegetable-varieties-hope-for-food-security-1951130
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Chinese Ambassadors advice critical to galamsey fight,"Public anger against illegal mining, otherwise known as galamsey, keeps growing in the country.
This can be deduced from the pressure being mounted currently on the government to stop galamsey, which is coming from prominent voices like the Asantehene,
Otumfuo Osei Tutu II
, the National Chief Imam, Sheik Osmanu Nuhu Sharubutu, the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference, the Ghana Bar Association (GBA), University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG) and various civil society organizations (CSOs).
The calls are a result of how galamseyers are destroying the countrys lands and water bodies in particular.
The destruction of the land, usually farmlands, means farming is under threat in the country and if that is the case, then declining food and cash crop production is imminent and the implications are obvious.
Besides, it is said that the chemicals used in illegal mining pose serious health threats such as kidney diseases, while they cause mothers in the mining communities to give birth to children with disabilities.
Since both Ghanaians and foreigners are involved in the heinous mining activity and Ghanaians, in general, keep on raising red flags against it, everyone expects that, at least, representatives of countries whose nationals are involved would also add their voice to warn their erring compatriots.
Since someone must always blaze a trail, the appeal by the Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, Mr Tong Defa, to his compatriots resident in the country to stay away from illegal mining activity is a critical example.
Though the Chinese are said to outnumber other foreigners doing illegal mining in the country, we think this alone cannot be the reason for Mr Defa to talk to his fellow citizens.
This is because he could have kept quiet over the matter, acknowledging the fact that those fellow citizens are making a living and obviously repatriating some money home.
However, he can see the damaging effects of the Chineses involvement in galamsey in the country on the image of his own country in the comity of nations.
Remarks Mr. Defa throws out in his appeal prove that he shares the stance of his country against galamsey by Chinese anywhere in the world.
China is widely known to support the rule of law and strict with law enforcement, and so, discourage its nationals from breaking the laws of other countries.
However, since the Chinese are also human, some of them can go wayward wherever the law appears lax.
So, for Mr. Defa to urge the government to let the law take its full course on any Chinese who disrespects the countrys laws on illegal mining to serve as deterrent to others implies that there would be no diplomatic innuendoes when Chinese offend the law and are being dealt with.
The Chinese Ambassador is being objective and needs commendation for making matters clear, especially for Ghanaians who are intrigued by why the Chinese are defiant and can even dare those who try to stop them from doing galamsey.
Every Ghanaian would support Chinese and, of course, other nationals doing legal mining in the country.
If his name can sound like the English word differ, then Mr. Defa has proven that he differs from others as he would not sit unconcerned for his fellow citizens to hurt other lands.
Mr Defas example must be emulated by other Ambassadors and High Commissioners in the country, even if their respective citizens are not noted for illegal mining here.
Even just their show of concern is support enough and this is needed in the countrys fight against illegal mining.",,Editorial, 16 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Chinese-Ambassador-s-advice-critical-to-galamsey-fight-1950957
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Bitumen plant can help reduce cost of road construction,"Yesterday, President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
inaugurated the $40-million African Bitumen Terminal at Tema.
The terminal is a joint venture between GOIL Ghana Limited and Societe Multinationale de Bitumes SMB) of La Cote dIvoire.
It will be recalled that in June 2019, the sod-cutting was performed in Tema for the construction of the first-ever bitumen plant in the country at the time Mr John Peter Amewu was the Energy Minister and stood in for President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
at the ceremony.
It is indisputable that in this country sod-cutting is done for certain projects but either the construction delays unduly or they are completely abandoned.
This mostly happens in cases of government-funded projects and the reasons for that state of affairs are best known to the Executive, including the President.
In the face of this, the Ghanaian Times commends GOIL and SMB for delivering the dream project in five years.
Thank God even though GOIL is a state-owned oil and gas marketing company, it kept to its resolve to uphold the partnership such that today, the country can boast its own bitumen plant.
We recall that while congratulating GOIL and SMB on the venture at the sod-cutting ceremony in June 2019, President Akufo-Addo made a statement to the effect that the bitumen facility is a classic example of the potential cooperation in development worthy of emulation in the ECOWAS sub-region.
It is on record that the partnership with SMB dates as far back as 2003 when GOIL decided to market bitumen.
For this reason, the SMB also deserves commendation for playing the role expected of it since GOIL struck the partnership with it.
The facility the country has now gives it certain advantages or benefits that cannot be underestimated.
It will produce the volumes of Polymer Modified Bitumen (PMB), and other bituminous products necessary to meet the demands of the countrys growing infrastructure sector.
The implication is that the country would stop the importation of bitumen and related products to save the country the huge amounts of hard currency used to import these products.
Last year, GOIL reported that the country was on course to reduce the $11.8 billion average annual bitumen import bill with its commercial production of polymer-modified bitumen (PMB).
It said with Ghanas estimated 192,000 tonnes a year demand for bitumen, its 240 tonnes per day bitumen capacity, or more than 87,000 tonnes per year would help to bridge the gap significantly.
It is hoped that the new facility would surmount all nascent problems and continuously expand to eventually meet the countrys demands so that one day the importation of bitumen and related products would be consigned to history.
That way, hopefully, the cost of road construction in the country would be reduced so that more roads could be constructed.
We know GOIL would bring out excellent products that would improve the quality and longevity of roads in the country, something which is a great wish of every Ghanaian.
It is a pity that some roads constructed in the country do not last even a year and they begin to develop potholes and all manner of defects.
The Ghanaian Times believes the bitumen plant would help transform the road sector of the country for the better.",,Editorial, 13 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Bitumen-plant-can-help-reduce-cost-of-road-construction-1950595
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Can GII monitoring system stop politicians electoral abuse,"Politicians and their parties in Ghana have been enjoying for far too long a period in which no individual, groups, or institutions in the country have made any serious attempt publicly to question them about campaign spending, abuse of incumbency, and campaign financing.
In the circumstances, the politicians and their parties have had a field day doing their own things in these areas without any restraint.
Therefore, the project launched to monitor and report on campaign spending, abuse of incumbency, and campaign financing can be a game-changer as it can rein in politicians regarding all the abuse in these areas.
The start of such a project is an initiative by the Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII), in partnership with the Ghana Anti-Corruption Coalition (GACC) and the Centre for Democratic Governance (CDD-Ghana) planned to last 10 months.
The Ghanaian Times wishes the project had been launched earlier to capture the periods of picking flagbearers of the parties, particularly by the incumbent New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the leading opposition party National Democratic Congress (NDC).
The whole country has not forgotten the noise made against amounts spent by the flagbearer hopefuls, including Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the incumbent Vice President (NPP), and former President John Dramani Mahama (NDC).
In spite of the absence of the GII initiative then, the Ghanaian Times thinks it is still timely as it is planned to capture campaign spending, abuse of incumbency, and campaign financing ahead of the 2024 general election.
About three months to go to the polls on December 7, this is the time the abuse of incumbency is so prominent as the party in power is using state resources like a fleet of vehicles, state security, and media more than normally expected but usually done under the guise of performing state duty.
This is a dicey issue but the Ghanaian Times believes the GII has the expertise to decipher which use of state resources, for instance, would constitute abuse of incumbency.
It is the hope of everyone that the GII monitoring system will be able to generate the envisaged empirical data on the evidence of campaign financing activities and to increase public awareness of the role of money in elections and the current campaign financing regime.
In this case, the Ghanaian Times hopes independent candidates would be monitored.
It is currently an open secret that money given out by political parties and politicians influences voting in the country.
The implication is that the choices made by those induced with money are not the true reflection of their wishes.
The result is that the people vote for politicians who easily choose to serve their own interest rather than the people.
It is no wonder politicians in the country, to a large extent, do not fulfill campaign promises.
Hopefully, the GII monitoring system would check abuse of incumbency, stop money-influenced voting and ensure the true choice of political representatives who practise true democracy by serving the interest of the people.
That way true accountability would be rendered by politicians and other state officials for the countrys forward march.",,Editorial, 12 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Can-GII-monitoring-system-stop-politicians-electoral-abuse-1950444
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: National campaign against galamsey a must!!,"The Ghanaian Times is highly elated that the Asantehene,
Otumfuo Osei Tutu II
, the University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG), and the Ghana Bar Association (GBA) have joined the calls on the government to take prompt action to stop galamsey in the country.
Those of us working for the Ghanaian Times are elated because we have never hidden our aversion to the illegal mining menace because of its deadly devastation to the countrys environment, particularly water bodies, farmlands, and forest reserves.
This paper has presented countless editorials demanding prompt action.
The latest of such editorials was on Monday, September 2, 2024.
In that piece titled Fight against galamsey must be won!!, the paper expressed worry about the enormous state resources being pumped into the fight against galamsey without any sign of victory in sight as President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
himself had once admitted how the galamsey problem had become insoluble.
In addition, the Editorial reminded President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of his remarks constituting his avowed resolve to eliminate galamsey since he was a presidential candidate in 2016 seeking the mandate of the people to rule the country and during his presidency.
He has stuck to that resolve to the extent of saying at one point that even if he has to put his presidency on line to win the fight, he would do so.
It is sad that politicians make all manner of claims to win power and sometimes make certain attempts upon winning power to fulfil the promises.
Usually, their actions are semblances of what they promised to do, because they fail to take the necessary actions to tackle the problems, especially if the solutions would cost them some votes in the next election.
In the circumstances, they employ subterfuge to acquit themselves and push the blame or the responsibility on others.
No wonder at a natural resource stakeholders dialogue in Accra in May 2023, the President said despite massive success in the fight against galamsey, the practice remained an existential threat and that galamsey must be stopped with the help of all Ghanaians and urged them not to rest until the menace had ceased.
In that same Editorial in reference were the following statements: Everyone, indeed, is expected to join the fight against galamsey but the government must spearhead it with support from chiefs and security personnel.
To this end the government must be resolute in its vow to eradicate the menace, rather than the public remarks that are just charade and populism.
Most of the time, politicians get away with unfulfilled promises in the absence of pressure on them to be accountable because either those to demand accountability have become their cronies or harbour the fear of all manner of oppression or repression.
The call for a national campaign against illegal mining is therefore welcome as it is timely and appropriate. (See our story on 12)
The focus must be on demanding accountability from the Akufo-Addo administration and making him do the needful to justify the huge state resources expended so far on the fight against galamsey.",,Editorial, 11 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-National-campaign-against-galamsey-a-must-1950242
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Oti, other new regions need medical stores","The appeal by the Oti Regional Director of
Ghana Health Service
(GHS), Dr Osei Kuffour Afreh, to the government to provide the region with a medical store to help improve health care delivery is an important one.
The explanation that the existence of a medical store in the region would help avoid the situation where the regional health directorate officials have to travel a long distance to Ho, the Volta Regional capital, for medical commodities is tenable.
If medical commodities include pharmaceuticals, consumable medical supplies, and durable medical equipment, then it means that sometimes the public health facilities in the region would not readily have available some items needed for emergency treatment or quality healthcare.
The Oti Region and five other regions, namely Ahafo, Brong East, Western North, North East, and Savanna, are six new regions created in the country in December 2018.
One important reason for creating new regions in a country is to bring administrative zones and their running closer to people in the affected areas.
In other words, newly-created regions are expected to enjoy some independence and ease regarding their development; and ready use of certain amenities or facilities.
Thus, when the Oti Region, for instance, was carved out of the Volta Region, the expectation was that everything necessary to make the new region independent of the mother region was going to be provided.
And even if this was not going to happen in the near future, it was expected to a large extent that the new region would have a healthcare base that could take care of its people except in the cases of referrals, which are a normal phenomenon in healthcare systems anywhere on the globe.
Therefore, it beats everyones imagination that for almost six years after its creation, the Oti Region still has to rely on its mother region for medical commodities, simply because it has no medical store to receive such commodities.
The Oti Region, with its capital as Dambai, comprises nine Municipal and District Assemblies (MDAs), whereas the Volta Region, with its capital as Ho, has 18 administrative districts.
What this means is that if the Volta Region continues to supply the Oti Region with medical commodities, then that burden of catering for 26 districts when Oti was an integral part of it has not been rolled away.
If that is so, then the Volta Region is at the receiving end and must be relieved of that stress, hence the urgent need for the Oti Region to have its own medical store for all the advantages it comes with.
For instance, the hundreds of kilometers to cover to go to Ho and the related cost and risk to bring the commodities to Dambai would be avoided.
In addition, the commodities needed would be readily available most of the time to help provide quality medical care in the region.
Also, drugs that need special storage conditions like cold temperatures can be kept safely.
Among other advantages, both the construction and existence of a medical store in the Oti Region would create jobs for some people.
It is the hope of the Ghanaian Times that the appeal for a medical store for the Oti Region would prompt the government to consider giving the other new regions too their own medical stores.",,Editorial, 10 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Oti-other-new-regions-need-medical-stores-1950061
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Congratulations on celebration of unique Fetu Afahye,"The Ghanaian Times congratulates the chiefs and people of the Oguaa Traditional Area on the celebration of their Fetu Afahye this year.
The mention of Oguaa readily brings to mind the historic city of Cape Coast and its people.
Even though Fetu Afahye has been celebrated for countless years, this years celebration deserves special mention because of its uniqueness in some ways.
First, it marks the 60th anniversary of the revival of the festival.
The period 1865 to 1964 has the chequered part of the history of the celebration of Oguaa Fetu Afahye.
It all began with some misunderstanding between the Oguaa people and the colonists, which eventually caused two Asafo companies in Cape Coast, Bentsir Asafo (No. 1) and Anaafo Asafo (No. 2) to combine forces to fight with British soldiers on September 4, 1865.
The festival was somehow terminated and it took some time before it could be revived.
However, in 1932, a fight between Bentsir (No. 1) Asafo and Ntsin (No. 3) Asafo brought in the colonial government to ban it until 1939 when the ban was relaxed a bit.
The chequered history continued until 1964, when seamless peaceful observance of Oguaa Fetu Afahye resumed.
The second reason why this years Fetu Afahye deserves a unique place in the annals of the festival is that it marks the 25th anniversary of the enthronement of Osabarima Kwesi Atta II as the Paramount Chief of the Oguaa Traditional Area.
Considering the history of the Oguaa paramountcy in which one reads about some occupants not reigning for up to 25 years before departing to meet their maker, except Osabarima Kodwo Mbrah V, who ruled from 1948  1996 (48 years), so far the longest-reigning king; and the fact that there have been some destoolment and abdication, 25 years of peaceful occupancy of the throne is a great feat.
Without any prejudice, one can conclude that he is doing well to meet the desires of his people.
Osabarimas appeal to the people of Oguaa to put their differences behind and unite to support all development projects in the area must be embraced with all seriousness because Cape Coast in particular needs a facelift that befits its status in the life of the country.
Osabarima, The Ghanaian Times extends its heart-felt congratulations to you on the 25th anniversary of your ascendency to the distinguished throne.
Your throne is distinguished because it is one of the thrones in the country that deserves no introduction in the global arena. After all, their jurisdictions occupy significant places in the history and everyday life of the whole country.
The presence of the Asantehene,
Otumfuo Osei Tutu II
, at the festival as the Guest of Honour speaks volumes more than the rich historical connection between Ashanti land and Oguaa Traditional Area.
The Asantehenes donation of GH500,000 to support an education fund for needy students under the auspices of Osabarima Kwesi Atta should ginger people of the Oguaa Traditional Area in particular to support the fund all the time.
Otumfuo is unique in his desire to give support and bring change wherever he goes, no matter whether it falls under his jurisdiction.
All Ghanaians should emulate this spirit in the hope that this selflessness can transform the country into a place where people are helpful and dependable, all towards having a united, peaceful, and prosperous nation.",,Editorial,  9 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Congratulations-on-celebration-of-unique-Fetu-Afahye-1949862
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Depoliticising galamsey fight should not be mere talk,"The conversation the Majority Leader, Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin, has broached in
Parliament
regarding the depoliticisation of the fight against illegal mining, popularly known as galamsey, is very important.
It is worthy of note that the case of broaching conversations on matters that affect the wellbeing of the entire nation should be an everyday practice or a norm in high places because this is where the movers and the shakers are.
In addition to galamsey and its devastating effects on the countrys environment, there are other issues that affect the whole nation which need to be discussed in a non-partisan manner.
For instance, Article 71 under which a chunk of the countrys financial resources is doled out to politicians, and the call for it to be expunged from the 1992 Constitution needs to be addressed in the national interest.
The need to have a clear-cut transparent system to probe how politicians make money in the twinkling of an eye is another national issue.
Why should politics be more lucrative than industry such that today, a good number of young people prefer doing politics, even if at the periphery of being errand guys for frontline politicians?
The situation where the countrys laws favour certain people in the society but punish ordinary people is also an issue of national interest.
Then the issue of public and civil servants demanding inducements from members of the public before rendering them services they are entitled to equally deserves national attention.
We live in a country where certain occurrences are brushed aside but are things that injure the nation in the eyes of the international community.
For instance, there is a video with the inscription Abla Amewota Amable circulating on social media in which a woman is comparing how the police in the US are always ready to assist whoever needs their services but some police personnel in Ghana treat members of the public who seek their services with disdain.
The Ghanaian Times cannot pinpoint when exactly the video emerged, but by this time it should be news that the woman in the video has been invited by the police as a way of starting an investigation into the matter.
It is true that the police act on complaints but should that always be the case?
What the Ghanaian Times is driving at is that there are countless other issues that deserve non-partisan discussion if the country should be a place where life is safe, peaceful, and comfortable.
But while we say this, we think the case of depoliticising all issues deemed important in the national interest must not just be mere talk but action.
If that is the case, then one way to depoliticise such issues is to have laws that bite.
It appears the legislation dealing with galamsey, for instance, does not bite enough, which is why some politicians can say whatever can win them political marks about the matter to tacitly encourage galamseyers to perpetrate their heinous activity.
It is also the case that there is no proper investigation instituted to probe rumours or accusations of the involvement of certain politicians, chiefs, and other high-profile persons in criminal activity.
It is clear the Majority Leader means well in his assertion to depoliticise the fight against galamsey, but he should act beyond mere talk.",,Editorial,  6 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Depoliticising-galamsey-fight-should-not-be-mere-talk-1949495
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Ghanas 30% surgical operation output disaster,"Surgical operations constitute a significant integral part of healthcare globally and the expectation is that all such operations can be carried out on 100 percent of patients who need them.
It is, therefore, unfortunate that currently, Ghana is doing only 30 percent of all surgical operations required across the country mainly due to under-tooling, inaccessibility, inadequate human resources, and the cost of care.
This means the countrys healthcare system is inadequate to a certain extent and this must not be ignored when it comes to assessing its effectiveness.
Clearly, this accounts for why some people in the country choose to go abroad for healthcare.
It is not wrong or an offence to go abroad for healthcare, because choices are allowed in every society, Ghana not being an exception, but there is no doubt that looking at the cost of choosing that path, some of those seeking medical care abroad would have reduced the cost by seeking care locally.
It is important that the four significant factors preventing the country from carrying out 100 percent of all surgical operations have been identified, namely inadequate human resources, under-tooling, inaccessibility, and the cost of care.
This means the countrys managers, the politicians to be precise, are aware of the problems and so must make attempts to solve them through the relevant state institutions.
The Ghanaian Times can readily guess the answer to the question as to why, for instance, the country faces problems regarding surgical, obstetric, trauma, and anesthesia (SOTA) care.
The lack of funds is blamed for every problem that the politicians fail to solve but we think that the good health of the people must be prioritised.
If the World Health Organisation Assembly (WHOA) recommends a minimum of 20 SOTA physicians per 100,000 people but Ghana is doing six, definitely these professionals would be unevenly distributed across the country with the number of specialists at the district levels being inadequate.
This means some patients would not get access to these professionals in their locality even if they have the resources to seek medical care.
The result is that they have to bear increased costs to seek care elsewhere, while those who cannot afford such a cost would have to look up to providence.
No wonder trauma, for instance, is said to be accounting for a huge number of deaths and has become one of the silent epidemics in the country.
Let it be known to the politicians that the masses or the populace are not happy when they hear the news of a politician seeking healthcare abroad.
Why do politicians plead no funds when the matter concerns ordinary people but quietly use state funds to care for themselves and their families in every aspect of their lives?
Certainly, no one country has adequate resources to cater to all the needs of the people, but healthcare must top the priority list because good health is what is needed for every citizen to be able to play a role in nation-building.",,Editorial,  5 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Ghana-s-30-surgical-operation-output-disaster-1949290
Edtorial by Ghanaian Times: Serious conservation can increase forest contribution to GDP,"A study conducted by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) in collaboration with the Forestry Commission (FC), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and Warner School of Forestry of the University of Georgia in the USA in 2022 as a sequel or follow-up to a 2014 one has revealed the declining contribution of the forestry sector to the countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
While in 2014, the sector, particularly forest products, and logging, contributed 2.0 percent of the countrys GDP in the sum of GH10.83 billion, the findings of the study commissioned in 2022 state that from 2014 to 2023, the contribution of the forest sector to the GDP on the average was 1.5 percent.
This must call for concern because a forest is one natural resource, which, when kept in shape, has a huge importance for the society that owns it.
Forests offer services such as providing food, water, wood, medicine, and numerous other products that society uses daily.
They also facilitate numerous regulating services such as carbon sequestration, flood control, plant pollination, and water filtration.
Besides, they are habitats for numerous animals and flora.
Forests are generally sources of livelihood for some people such as loggers, hunters, herbal medicine practitioners, and their assistants.
The experts say generally that forests are integral to the countrys economy and societal well-being, as they support livelihoods, provide food and raw materials, contribute to climate resilience, and sustain agriculture.
In spite of these benefits, which underpin the survival of society, it is clear that forests in Ghana are not well taken care of.
It is unavoidable that as the population grows, there will be the need for agricultural expansion to produce more food to feed the growing population.
However, such an undertaking must be orderly, not haphazardly as the case is now regulated by law or proper rules.
In the olden days, members of the society abided by traditional rules and regulations as to their use of land and how to deal with forests.
Fuel wood collection and the creation of more settlements to meet growing populations today also undermine forest conservation, which was a norm for society in the past to derive all the benefits the forest existed to provide.
Today, people, particularly, illegal loggers and illegal miners, do not care about the conservation of the forest as they are only interested in what they can exploit from it for their selfish gains.
The result is that most of the benefits that can formally contribute to the countrys GDP are lost.",,Editorial,  4 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Edtorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Serious-conservation-can-increase-forest-contribution-to-GDP-1949082
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: KBTHs Legacy Project commendable but...,"It cannot be taken for granted the disclosure by the management of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) that in a bid to remain at the forefront of medical progress both locally and internationally, it intends to establish an ultramodern learning, research, and innovation center to enhance its health service delivery.
This is because since its opening on October 9, 1923, as a general hospital and 200-bed facility, the healthcare centre has come to be a teaching hospital and is now a 2,000-bed entity and still growing.
It is currently the largest hospital in West Africa and the leading national referral centre in Ghana.
Its facilities and services, including DNA investigations, draw international patients, particularly from neighbouring countries such as Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Togo.
Since the KBTH continues to introduce specialised services, it is the prayer of the Ghanaian Times that its fresh initiative, dubbed the Legacy Project, an 18-million dollar facility, could be completed within the scheduled two-year period to earn it the envisaged status of a one-stop reference facility for medical discoveries to address present and future health problems.
The good health of people everywhere is societys great asset because it needs healthy people to ensure its development and progress.
Therefore, if that society has a good healthcare system, including modern facilities and excellent services, coupled with affordability, then the good health of the people is a given.
However, there is one important area mentioned by the management in which the Ghanaian Times is particularly interested.
The fact that moving forward, the hospital would view its clients as its major stakeholders, putting measures in place to maintain and boost clients confidence in the hospital is a very important matter.
Obviously, patients are the major clients of every hospital and so this paper is gladdened by this position.
Oftentimes, the bad attitudes of healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, negatively affect some patients.
Some nurses are abusive and take advantage of the vulnerable state of some patients to abuse them.
If KBTH should be among the best hospitals in the world, then first, its personnel, particularly nurses, should have an excellent character that can boost patients confidence and be a reference point for nurses everywhere to emulate when it comes to making patients feel at home.
It is, therefore, a good decision that the management of the hospital has started a patient feedback system under which they will take note of the specific concerns of patients in order to address them.
Why should any patient in their right senses refuse to visit the KBTH and for that matter any healthcare facility in the country until their condition gets worse at which point they would be bundled there by family members?
Everyone, no matter who is or the prevalent condition he or she is in, would like to be accorded respect and dignity, which some nurses and other hospital workers are in the habit of denying them.
Other serious issues like having to contact someone before getting a bed to allow for a certain treatment to start should also die.
Is it true that some doctors are paid bribes before they accept to treat some patients because of their peculiar condition?
Like any other hospital, the KBTH should ensure that all efforts there to save lives are backed by respect and dignity for patients.",,Editorial,  3 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-KBTH-s-Legacy-Project-commendable-but-1948915
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Fight against galamsey must be won!!,"Today, the Ghana Water Limited (GWL) reports that illegal mining activities (galamsey) along the Pra River in the Central Region is making it almost impossible for it to extract raw water from its Sekyere Hemang Treatment Plant to supply adequate potable water to residents of Cape Coast, Elmina and surrounding communities.
The company says currently, the plant can produce only a quarter of its installed capacity because about 60 percent of the rivers catchment area was silted as a result of illegal mining, which compromises the quantity and quality of the raw water.
This problem replicates itself in relative terms wherever galamsey is happening and this is a huge problem in the country, considering the importance of water to the very existence of the society.
While campaigning in 2016 to win power to assume the countrys Presidency in 2017, candidate
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
vowed to fight galamsey upon assuming office.
Fortunately, he won power and subsequently launched the war against galamsey because of its devastating impacts on the environment, including the pollution of sources of water in the country.
A lot of state resources have gone into the fight yet galamsey has become insoluble and President Akufo-Addo himself once admitted it.
At a natural resource stakeholders dialogue in Accra in May 2023, the President said despite massive success in the fight against galamsey, the practice still remained an existential threat and that galamsey must be stopped.
To that end, he said the fight against illegal mining could be won if all Ghanaians got involved and urged them not to rest until the menace had ceased.
Earlier on October 16, 2022, while at the Manhyia Palace in Kumasi at the start of a four-day tour of the Ashanti Region, President Akufo-Addo had said, We are here to eradicate galamsey and surely, it would be eradicated.
Way back on July 10, 2017, in Accra, while addressing a two-day workshop on galamsey for traditional leaders drawn from different parts of the country, the President said: I have said it in the Cabinet, and perhaps this is the first time I am making this public, that I am prepared to put my Presidency on the line on this matter.
If in the midst of all this avowed commitment and clout, the President and his government are yet to win the fight against galamsey, the Ghanaian Times wonders which various avenues the Ghana Water Limited would explore to stop galamsey in the countrys water bodies which are the sources of water it needs to supply for use by the people of this country.
Everyone, indeed, is expected to join the fight against galamsey but the government must spearhead it with support from chiefs and security personnel.
To this end, the government must be resolute in its vow to eradicate the menace, rather than the public remarks that are just charades and populism.
The Ghanaian Times, thus, would like to ask the political parties in the country, particularly the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and National Democratic Congress (NDC), to tell the public what provisions they have in their manifestoes for Election 2024 on how they are going to sustain the victory if President Akufo-Addo wins the galamsey fight before he leaves office on January 7, 2025.
Alternatively, let the NPP and NDC tell Ghanaians how they would assume the fight and win it should the NPP break the 8 or the NDC curtail that dream.
This is important because water crises in the country affect every resident.",,Editorial,  2 September 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Fight-against-galamsey-must-be-won-1948730
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Ensure swift release, disbursement of banking sector clean-up bailout","It is good news that a total of GH700 million is to be released to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for disbursement to some fund management companies (FMCs) to pay individuals whose funds were locked up as a result of the financial sector clean-up exercise embarked on by the government.
The countrys banking sector clean-up exercise was embarked upon in August 2017 by the Akufo-Addo administration some seven months into its second term, which began on January 7 of that year.
Even though the clean-up is touted as having created a more sustainable industry because the regulatory crackdown on poor business practices and weak capital positions in the countrys banking sector has brought about a series of market exits ever since.
In other words, as a result of the clean-up, the weak players in the industry have left it such that their worse impacts on customers in particular have been curtailed or avoided.
But be it as the situation is now being praised, customers of the affected FMCs see the clean-up exercise differently because some of them have parts of their investments still locked up in the systems.
Some of these customers who have no hills from whence their help would come have suffered untold hardships.
It can hardly be ruled out that a number of them have even passed on because of the financial stress they were suffering.
There are cases of others, especially pensioners, whose investments were meant to see their young children through schooling but the situation has scuttled that dream.
Those who had planned to build capital to run businesses have also been forced to shelve that dream.
What about investments meant for travel for greener pastures?
Only those who had destiny helpers can boast good lives, but that doesnt mean they have forgotten about their locked-up investments.
This is why the Ghanaian Times is describing it as good news the GH700 million to be released to the SEC for disbursement to some FMCs to pay individuals whose funds were locked up as a result of the financial sector clean-up exercise.
The money is said to be the first tranche of an additional GH 1.5 billion to be released by the government to bail out the remaining asset management companies.
It is exactly seven years now since the clean-up was embarked upon by the government and what it means is that the value of the locked-up investments has fallen drastically in the face of the depreciation of the local currency over the seven-year period.
Even if the locked up moneys is accruing interests, it is not wrong to say that the interest plus the principal together cannot accomplish what just the principal could do at the time of its investment.
Therefore, the Ghanaian Times appeals that the bureaucracy involved in releasing and disbursement the GH700 million should be toned down to reduce the financial stress being suffered by the affected customers.
Besides, it should not take too long for the government to release the remaining GH800 million of the GH1.5 billion earmarked for the bailout.
Despite the good things that can be said about the banking sector clean-up embarked upon in 2017, the fact is that its flipside has affected some people and it is good the govt is aware of this and doing its best to ameliorate the peoples suffering but this must be done swiftly.",,Editorial, 30 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Ensure-swift-release-disbursement-of-banking-sector-clean-up-bailout-1948315
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Ghanas fishery industry truly needs restoration!!,"On November 3, 2017, the Earth Journalism Network (EJN) published an article with the title Ghana: Declining fishery stocks impacting coastal communities in Ghana.
The EJN, created in 2004 to empower and enable journalists from developing countries to cover the environment more effectively, is now a truly global network of reporters and media outlets.
The EJN piece in question, authored by Ghanaian journalist Shirley Asiedu-Addo, captures the illegal methods used in depleting the countrys fishery stocks and the impacts, including the sufferings being borne by fisherfolk and their families, the entire coastal communities, and the society at large.
In part, the article states: Fisher communities in Ghana are getting poorer. The fishery stocks are at a frighteningly low level and experts say they are nearing a state of collapse. To make things worse, the government is essentially helpless in its efforts to control the continued practice of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing on the seas.
Then it adds that for fear of losing the favour of the fisherfolk, successive governments have failed to address and alter the realities of the criminalities of the fishery industry.
It goes further to list the ills contributing to the depletion of the countrys fishery stocks as including an unregulated boat entry system, a free-for-all all to catch whatever remains; the use of carbide, dynamite, and washing soap; and the practice of light fishing.
All these, according to the experts undermine the growth of the countrys fishery stocks as these methods catch even juvenile fishes which have not bred before.
At the time of publishing the article, fishery experts said as a result of these IUU practices, Ghana was losing over US$100,000 a day.
Since the government could not solve the problems, in 2021, the Environmental Justice Foundation, based in the United Kingdom, published under the auspices of the UNs Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) an equally disturbing piece with the title At what cost? How Ghana is losing out in fishing arrangements with Chinas distant water fleet.
The piece introduces another subject, which is the expansion of coastal bottom trawling in West Africa, including Ghana, and raises serious concerns about it.
The publication states that in addition to the highly-destructive environmental footprint the bottom trawling leaves behind, the crews involved in the practice generate conflicts with small-scale fishers; and engage in illegal activities.
It is said that China is the leading player in West Africas bottom trawling fishery.
What is worrying in the case of Ghana is that 90 percent of trawlers operating in the country are beneficially owned by Chinese corporations yet they fly the countrys flags despite a prohibition against foreign ownership or control of trawlers doing so.
It is sad to learn that these Chinese vessels operate through local front companies, using opaque corporate structures to import their vessels, register and obtain a licence to fish.
Just yesterday, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development reported that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) would be providing $ 24 million in funding to restore the countrys coastal fisheries.
The Ministry particularly said the restoration would focus on improving ocean conservation along the coast areas, as well as drive positive change across the entire fisheries value chain.
Even though the expression drive positive change across the entire fisheries value chain is vague, the Ghanaian Times wants to believe that the implementation of that positive change would not leave out addressing the issues raised in the two articles alluded to in this piece, including enacting laws to check both existing and emerging challenges in the fishery industry.
After all, the essence must be to improve the industry, which massively serves as a source of food and livelihood to Ghanaians.",,Editorial, 29 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Ghana-s-fishery-industry-truly-needs-restoration-1948140
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Try harsher punishments in stemming exam malpractices!,"Once again there have been arrests of people allegedly attempting to assist candidates cheat in an examination being conducted by the West African Examination Council (WAEC).
This time the suspects are six teachers arrested across the country for allegedly engaging in examination malpractices in the ongoing West Africa Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).
If on Day 2 of the WASSCE six teachers have been arrested, the Ghanaian Times would not be surprised to hear about more arrests in the examination scheduled to end on September 20, 2024.
Our speculation is based on the fact that in spite of arrests, prosecution, and other punitive actions by WAEC, every year, certain bad lots still indulge in malpractices from the start of the examination till its end and the numbers usually overwhelm the examination body.
Imagine, for example, that in the case of the 2023 WASSCE, the Head of Public Relations of WAEC Ghana, John Kapi, at a press conference in Accra, could not provide a comprehensive list of candidates, invigilators, and teachers arrested, but said: we have overwhelming numbers.
Note the categories of persons involved in the examination malpractices  teachers, invigilators, and candidates or students.
If it is on record as claimed by Mr Kapi last year that some school officials charged candidates varying sums ranging from GH500 to GH1,000 to aid them in cheating in the examination hall, then the list of those who indulge in examination malpractices includes others like parents and school authorities.
Besides indulging in the criminal acts, as stipulated by the WAEC Act, 2006 (Act 719), some culprits attempt to bribe WAEC officials who catch them in the act and effect their arrest.
It appears indulging in examination malpractices has become a pastime for certain people and so there is the need to diagnose the problem and cure it.
Its obvious there are monetary gains for some of the people involved but the bottom line is that the candidates, teachers, school officials, and parents are seeking unmerited excellence for the candidates because they are ill-prepared.
This is akin to reaping where they did not sow and the implications are not good for the personality development of the candidates first and foremost.
The perpetrators aiding the candidates to cheat are inculcating in them habits of embracing dishonesty, unduly hijacking any system they think should help them, side-lining others, duping others, and practising all manner of corrupt practices among other myriad negative habits.
On the part of teachers and school officials, it is clear they want excellence for candidates to conceal their ineptitude, negligence of duty, and or laziness, to outwit others to seek admission to their schools.
The whole matter gives out those involved, including parents, as corrupt people who would make use of every opportunity, no matter evil, for their selfish gains.
Such people are not to be entertained in society.
This is why the Ghanaian Times agrees to suggestions made by the education think tank, Africa Education Watch (EduWatch), last year that the Ghana Education Service should escalate its sanctions regime to an outright dismissal of teachers who misconduct themselves in WAEC examinations; and that the government should amend the WAEC Law because sanctions in the original law are outdated.
Hopefully stricter or harsher punishments can help kill examination malpractices in the country.",,Editorial, 28 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Try-harsher-punishments-in-stemming-exam-malpractices-1947955
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Emulate Tongu chiefs!,"There is no gainsaying the fact that chiefs in the country generally lost their original powers at the advent of colonialism and subsequent political developments, including the so-called democracy, which came with appendages some of which can be described as being troublesome.
There was a time when chiefs wielded authority that made them shakers and movers in their communities and, with the assistance of their council members, could contain all manner of misconduct among the people and ensure peaceful living and development.
The solace is that chiefs are recognised by the state to play roles that fall within the confines of the constitution.
This is good, but the situation has given some citizens the impetus to show disdain to the extent that they have the audacity and the impudence to decline the chiefs invitation to the palace in respect of some bad things they have done.
The Ghanaian Times is glad that the chiefs have not given up on what they can do to help develop the country.
On this note, the paper applauds the 13 paramount chiefs from the three Tongu districts, namely North, South, and Central Tongu, for forming the Union of Tongu Chiefs (UTC).
The UTC has the primary goal to promote peace and unity among the chiefs and people of Tongu in order to accelerate development in the Tongu jurisdiction.
Members of the Union must note that their achievement is a great feat, as it is said that similar attempts to form associations in the Volta Region, where the Tongu districts are located, have failed due to petty conflicts.
Is it not sad to learn that there are 49 chieftaincy disputes pending before the Volta Regional House of Chiefs?
The Ghanaian Times agrees with anyone or institution describing the situation as a disturbing trend that hinders the regions development.
For example, it would be difficult to reach an agreement and have one voice on certain matters that would bring development to the communities there.
The paper thus joins the pleading from the Paramount Chief of Anfoega Traditional Area and President of the VRHC, Togbe Tepre Hodo, that the UTC would not become a ground for chieftaincy disputes but would use its influence to help resolve pending cases amicably to promote peace and unity in Tongu and, by extension, the whole region.
This should not be a problem for the UTC because it has a history regarding the formation of unions in the region and the knowledge of the strengths of a union to guide it.
As with any other union, the UTC has the collective strength that has a bearing on brokering peace since it can douse all biases with its power of collectivity.
It also has the ability to ensure mutual respect and fairness for the chieftains involved in disputes.
While helping to resolve disputes in its jurisdiction and the entire region, the union would surely see peace and unity as the order of the day.
As a result, development would seamlessly flow into the region no matter which political party is in power because there would be that collective effort to seek it.
Considering what the Union of Tongu Chiefs can do to enhance development in its jurisdiction, the Volta Region, and the entire country, the Ghanaian Times urges it to try and surmount all nascent problems and be a force to reckon with.
That way, it would not be difficult for other paramount chiefs to see the strength in unity and emulate the Union to promote peace and development in the country.",,Editorial, 27 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Emulate-Tongu-chiefs-1947781
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Congrats to NDC on launch of manifesto,"The
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) has launched its manifesto for the countrys 2024 general election.
Once a major contender in the December 7, 2024, presidential and parliamentary elections, it was unavoidable for the NDC to present its manifesto outlining the partys take on elements of nation-building in order for voters to compare its stance on these elements, compare them to their opponents', and make informed decisions as to which political parties deserve their votes.
Its unfortunate that in our country and elsewhere, some voters, no matter their level of education and social standing, make their decision to vote for one party, a candidate, or another even before the launch of any party or candidates manifesto.
However, the manifesto is important because it gives all the party members one voice on issues chosen by the party to dwell on.
Besides, it gives political analysts the basis to see parties policies or intentions about how they intend to govern should they win power.
For these reasons, it was good that the NDC launched its manifesto on Saturday, three and a half months before voting on December 7.
As any other party would do, even before the launch, the partys flagbearer, former President
John Dramani Mahama
, his running mate, Prof. Naana Jane Opoku Agyemang, and the partys political communicators had been giving snippets of information on the views and intentions of the party on issues regarding some of the actions the party would take when it gains power in this years elections.
That notwithstanding, the Ghanaian Times thinks the NDC manifesto is worth reading as it has outlined strategies to tackle national problems.
Those not desiring to read all the documents can, at least, peruse the highlights.
Two areas under the highlights that particularly interest the Ghanaian Times are secondary education, good governance, anti-corruption, and accountability.
It gladdens the heart of the Ghanaian Times that under the banner of secondary education, the NDC says it will improve the Free Senior High School Programme and expand it to include students in private SHSs in underserved or deprived areas.
This puts to rest the campaign being bandied around the idea that should the NDC win power, the Free SHS program would be abolished.
The NDC take on the program is a great assurance and also a sign that the Ghanaian politician is maturing towards seeing what is helpful to the whole nation rather than feeding the myopic interests of a few partisan people.
The NDC maintained the National Health Insurance Scheme introduced by the Kufuor administration, the first NPP regime in the countrys Fourth Republic, and so we can take them by their word this time too.
Regarding good governance, anti-corruption, and accountability, it would gladden everyones heart to see any political administration fight corruption and be accountable to the people.
We want politicians to note that the fight must begin with politicians because in any country where politics is more profitable than industry and even erring politicians are portrayed as saints, fighting corruption will always fail.
It is very helpful that the NDC has launched its manifesto, and our appeal is that should it win power, it should not depart from it but rather seek to improve situations as the exigencies of the times present them.",,Editorial, 26 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Congrats-to-NDC-on-launch-of-manifesto-1947609
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Violators of Public Health Act, 2012 must face stiffer punishment!","The countrys Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) keeps reminding manufacturers, importers, exporters, and the public that it is an offence under the Public Health Act, 2012 (Act 851) to manufacture, prepare, import, export, distribute, sell, supply, or exhibit for sale any of the FDA's regulated products, such as food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical products, without registering them first with the Authority.
In addition to this legislation, which is common knowledge in the business industry in the country, the FDA organises unannounced swoops to check compliance with the law.
It is, therefore, intriguing that some individuals and organizations keep flouting it.
In fact, Sections 99 and 118 of the Public Health Act, 2012, prohibit the importation of unregulated products, yet such products are common in the country.
Just yesterday, the FDA confiscated large quantities of unregistered products at four Chinese supermarkets at Osu in Accra, namely Jia Hua Agricultural Trade Company, Panda Mart, Downwind Sail, and Hauang Jia YI Limited, during a swoop.
Besides contravening the Public Health Act, the operators of the supermarkets flouted the labelling guide (LI 1541), which requires all products imported into the country to be labelled in the English Language, but all the products seized had only Chinese labels.
The Ghanaian Times wonders what actually gives the impetus for the flouting of the law and the rubbishing of the swoops.
The FDA explains that such unregistered products are brought into the country through smuggling.
This awareness itself is enough to prompt the authority to deepen its surveillance duties and intensify the swoops.
From all indications, the FDA is very concerned about the countrys public health safety and therefore must check the sale of expired products too.
But it needs public support to discharge that duty.
Analyzing some statements made by its officials in public, such as public health safety is a shared responsibility,"" one clearly sees that the authority needs serious public support.
Therefore, members of the public must give tip-offs to help trace people who, for the sake of their selfish economic gains, would do everything to achieve that desire without paying heed to public health safety.
In fact, such tip-offs are in the interest of the whole nation.
But while we appeal to the public to support the FDA, we would like its officials, in particular, to do introspection and also look around themselves to see whether any of them are doing something untoward to undermine their collective efforts.
Its not about only corruption but also about showing leniency and allowing laxity in the law.
It is reported that during the swoop yesterday, some managers of the supermarkets were seen pleading for leniency.
The Ghanaian Times believes that asking for leniency is a natural thing for anyone caught in an offense or crime, but it appears the managers were doing so because the FDA has certain officials who would easily give in.
In any case, we expect that the FDA would be careful but resolute in discharging its duties in order to avoid suits such as the one by Tobinco Pharmaceuticals.
But we know that those found to have violated Act 851 must be surcharged to pay administrative fines or even prosecuted.
We think it is time for culprits to face both punishments.",,Editorial, 23 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Violators-of-Public-Health-Act-2012-must-face-stiffer-punishment-1947208
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Dont relent in effort to locally fund cocoa purchases!,"After 32 years of contracting a syndicated loan annually to purchase cocoa from farmers in the country, the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) says that beginning in 2024/2025, it will finance the purchase of cocoa beans and its operations domestically.
Over the past three decades, COCOBOD has been securing a syndicated loan each year, usually around August or September.
Going for syndicated loans to buy cocoa from the farmers at a fixed price and protect them from changes in global prices meant that COCOBOD needed amounts too large to attract the willingness of a single entity to lend to a single borrower.
What that implied was that COCOBOD didnt have enough of its own funds to undertake that operation.
Some of us had been worrying about the COCOBODs annual cap-in-hand exercise, wondering why that should be so for an agency of a country that was the worlds leading producer of cocoa between 1911 and 1976, contributing between 30-40 of the global total output, but now second with cocoa still contributing a chunk part of the countrys foreign exchange earnings.
Definitely, something was wrong somewhere that needed to be addressed.
For instance, in September 2020, the COCOBOD signed an agreement for a US$1.3 billion syndicated loan facility for the 2020/2021 cocoa crop, yet in 2021 it recorded a loss of GH2 billion, which was said to be the result of a strategic decision to maintain farmer payments despite the organisations financial performance.
Today, COCOBOD claims it is financially healthy, citing over GH2 billion in profit it made in 2022/2023.
Taking into consideration the current financial standing of COCOBOD, we wish to agree that it can wean itself off syndicated loans, beginning from the 2024/2025 cocoa season as it has announced.
However, the Ghanaian Times is once again worried about something important for that journey.
Why did the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the COCOBOD, Joseph Boahen Aidoo, refuse to answer at the news conference in Accra on Tuesday the question as to how cocoa purchases could be funded without the syndicated loan?
Meanwhile, the CEO made a heart-warming statement We are looking for US$1.5 billion this crop season, and looking at the interest rates last year, which were over eight percent, plus the cost, it means that we can save more than US$150 million by the decision not to go offshore.
The Ghanaian Times thinks his unwillingness to answer that question and that the source of funding could only be given later can cause others to speculate in certain ways.
Can we say, for instance, that the COCOBOD is not far advanced in its readiness for the change because, as indicated in this piece, in the case of the syndicate loans, it always went for it in August or September, meaning it finished the preparation earlier before the actual process for the loan began?
If we are in August and securing the funding locally, what prevents the COCOBOD from giving, at least, an inkling of the source(s) of the domestic funding of COCOA purchases?
Whatever the case, the Ghanaian Times prays that COCOBOD will succeed in its efforts to wean itself off contracting syndicated loans for cocoa purchases so that the country can enjoy the related benefits.",,Editorial, 22 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Don-t-relent-in-effort-to-locally-fund-cocoa-purchases-1947028
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Contain unbridled population growth!!,"Population growth everywhere has implications for the general life of the affected area.
That is to say, every sector of the life of the area would have some advantages if the society planned for the growth, or chaos would set in where there was no planning to contain the growth.
Therefore, the information put out by the University of Ghana Regional Institute of Population Studies (RIPS) that Ghanas population is projected to increase by 20 million by 2050 should be treated by the state as a call to prepare for the situation.
No one should mince words to say that Ghana is a place where successive governments have failed to plan for sustainable life across the country.
A critical look at what governments over the last 40 years, for instance, have done are mostly projects they can immediately gain personal financial benefits from and as well trumpet them to attract votes to retain them in power.
Amenities like schools, hospitals, roads, and so-described affordable housing are good, but check their spread or distribution.
According to the RIPS, the countrys population of 30.8 million in 2021 has grown to 33,007,618 million currently, and with that growth rate, the figure will hit about 53 million in the next 26 years.
Since the population structure comprises children, youth, and the elderly, the needs of these categories of people would obviously increase.
What is happening currently with the 33 million people is overwhelming, and so we can envisage a worse situation with 53 million; hence, the status quo must change for a sustainable life in the country.
Such planning must take a critical look at the current challenges and find solutions to them, as it is done elsewhere.
The first step is to look at all the factors that drive the unbridled population growth in the country, which are fanned by the countrys culture of the people desiring many children.
The saying that once you have the means, you can have any number of children is outdated and must be dealt with in order to limit related repercussions on the whole society.
Mauritius, for instance, at a time in its history, used improved female educational status and active family planning programs to ensure a decline in population growth.
What tools can Ghana use?
Yes, everyone can talk about such solutions as creating jobs for the youth and providing more infrastructure and social amenities, but it appears these solutions are proffered without much thought about the factor that can allow for them: land.
The poor land management in the country makes even a slim growth in population risky for a sustainable life here.
Everything points to the fact that there are no reserved places for amenities in communities and for farming, and spatial planning is worse.
It is sad that even new communities not controlled by estate developers lack roads and other thoroughfares, and what is more worrying is that planning is more horizontal than vertical, which means there is no maximum use of the land in the building sector in particular.
It is more important now than ever before that the government itself take population growth and its repercussions more seriously and do all it can to inculcate that same seriousness in the people to contain the unbridled population growth and its negative impacts that can undermine sustainable life in the country.",,Editorial, 21 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Contain-unbridled-population-growth-1946849
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Lets support materialisation of petroleum hub,"When President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
took power in 2017, he revealed his vision of establishing a petroleum hub in and for the country.
Thus, his government first established the Petroleum Hub Development Corporation (PHDC) in 2020 through an Act of Parliament, Act 1053, which is the Petroleum Hub Development Corporation Act, 2020.
The PHDC was to drive the promotion and development of the hub in terms of securing licenses, permits, and other required government support.
Yesterday, President Akufo-Addo cut the sod to begin the construction of the $60 billion petroleum hub in the Jomoro Municipality of the Western Region.
So far, there is much information about the hub, part of which talks about its benefits.
Basically, the hub is going to sit on 20,000-acre land with a coastline, intended to be the leading integrated petroleum complex to add value to the upstream and downstream oil and gas value chains in Africa.
It is planned to be executed in three phases, from this year till the end of 2036, with the first phase, estimated at $12 billion, focusing on building a 300,000-barrel per day (bpd) refinery, a 90,000-bpd petrochemical plant, a three-million cubic-meter storage facility, and a jetty with port infrastructure.
Considering even just the first phase, one would not be wrong to say that when completed, the infrastructure alone would be a beauty to behold in its locality.
Besides, the hubs economic and other benefits are obvious, which means the whole project must become a reality no matter which political party is in power.
This is a national project for the benefit of the whole Ghanaian public.
What else would be to the benefit of even the ordinary Ghanaian if all homes and industries in the country had access to reliable, affordable, sustainable energy because the hub was towards the realisation of a modern, diversified, efficient, and financially sustainable energy economy?
The anticipation that the hub will change the face of the petroleum industry on the continent cannot be discounted because other African countries can come here to refine their crude oil and buy some petroleum products that they would otherwise import from elsewhere far away.
As we have already expressed our hope, this hub must materialize, and if this happens, then it means all crooked lines must be straightened and rough surfaces made smooth.
When we say this, we first want to appeal that everything possible must be done to put to rest the agitations by the so-described Coalition of Concerned Nzema People, which is threatening legal action over the acquisition of the 200-acre land the hub is going to sit on.
Hopefully, prompt payment of compensation, as the Ministry of Finance releases about GH200 million for that purpose, would help douse the fire.
We also want to be proactive in saying that the PHDC, or for that matter, the government, must do well to ensure the fulfilment of the provisions in the agreement signed and only effect changes if the exigencies of the times demand so.
The Ghanaian Times is so happy that none of the partners can halt the project.
Let us all join President Akufo-Addo in urging all stakeholders to be guided by the vision of a prosperous and sustainable hub.",,Editorial, 20 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-s-support-materialisation-of-petroleum-hub-1946662
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Heed advice on Mpox!,"The public has been advised by the
Ministry of Health
(MoH) to report any likely symptoms of monkeypox (MPox) to the nearest health facility to help contain the spread of the disease in the country.
The World Health Organization says Mpox shows symptoms like fever, chills, and body aches.
However, people with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest, and genitals.
First identified by scientists in 1958 among monkeys, Mpox is now a human disease as well and is mostly found in people in central and west Africa who have close contact with infected animals.
Though not airborne, once contracted by humans, it is quickly spread through close, skin-to-skin contact, including kissing, touching, oral, and penetrative sex.
When it comes to certain areas of life, the laymans view can be disastrous in the end, so only the expert views are helpful.
Before the MoH admonition, the
Ghana Health Service
(GHS) announced that it had heightened its surveillance and emergency response systems to quickly detect possible cases of Mpox, which had surged elsewhere in the West African sub-region.
Then it advised that when anyone had a fever, nausea, or muscle pain, they should contact a health facility and have a test run and that if it did not confirm malaria, it could be some other disease, possibly Mpox, which would require specific treatment.
The GHS further advised that people having rashes should go to the hospital and run a test, as that could give health professionals a clue where the virus was so that they could follow it and be able to test people who had had contact with the patient so the GHS would be able to contain the spread of the disease.
The Ghanaian Times thinks that all the pieces of advice about Mpox are in the interest of the general public.
That attitude of some members of the public, trashing even expert advice and wishing away calamities such as they did with COVID-19, must stop.
Also, people who would have any of the symptoms suspected to prove a case of Mpox must not do self-medication.
Such people must immediately go to the nearest clinic or hospital for medical checks.
This is important because the disease, which began as an endemic strain known as Clade 1, has now changed into a new variant called Clade 1 b, spreading more through routine contact, particularly among children, and has so far affected over 15,000 people and killed 461 in 18 countries this year.
Although the country has not recorded any cases this year, cases of Mpox in the last two years should warn every Ghanaian that it is possible for it to have cases if medical alerts are not followed.
From all indications, the health authorities in the country, spearheaded by the MoH and its major agency, the GHS, are doing all they can to contain the spread of Mpox in and around the country.
All they need is the support of the public while African countries wait for vaccines and other facilities to handle Mpox, including its treatment and prevention.
Just last week, precisely on August 14, the WHO declared Mpox a public health emergency, which means Mpox is serious, sudden, unusual, has implications for public health beyond where it originated from, and requires immediate international action.
Even this alone should prompt adherence to the MPOX advice currently being given.",,Editorial, 19 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Heed-advice-on-Mpox-1946482
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Growth in interest in child adoption good,"The country is said to be witnessing a growing interest in child adoption.
Data from the Central Adoption Authority (CAA) confirms that 158 families have sought to adopt children in the first half of this year alone, with 220 various interested parties having made enquiries about adoption within the same period from the CAA, which operates under the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection.
Per January 2023 statistics from the Department of Social Welfare (DSW), on average, it was receiving from across the country about 20 applications for adoption a month.
This translated into some 240 a year, and we can guess that the figure could not cross 300.
The average number of applications that received a court order of adoption, which is the document that completes an adoption process, was reported to be five a month.
The five translated into 60 approvals in a year, and we can say that even if there were some changes, the figure could not cross 100.
If we agree to work with these figures, then the 158 figure for the first half of this year indicates an increase in the desire to adopt in the country.
It is on record that in times past, formal adoption of children in the country was not a welcome idea as it was considered a foreign culture.
However, people, including relatives, could accept the responsibility of living with and caring for other peoples children.
In recent times, however, awareness creation and education have led to a growing interest in adoption as a solution for childlessness by individuals and couples who desire to be parents and even some people who have their own children but wish to have more to care for.
Generally speaking, adoption is the process by which an adult takes over parental responsibility for a child based on certain circumstances.
Prominent among the circumstances is the fact that the child in question does not have parents.
In some cases, the children have parents, but the family is in need, and the parents consent to adoption.
Usually, it is couples incapable of bearing a child of their own who adopt.
Adoption then allows adoptive individuals or couples to legally take responsibility for the child.
If, in the past, adoption was not the norm in the country, why is it growing now?
It is said the number of adoption applications is soaring because awareness of adoption is now on the rise.
Today, the stigma associated with adoption is gone to a large extent.
The Ghanaian Times believes that such awareness has opened up advantages to both the adoptive individuals and the children being adopted, and, in some cases, the parents or families giving out the children for adoption.
For instance, the adoptive parties can experience the joy of having a family.
Besides, when people adopt for inheritance purposes, they can be sure that their estates are in good hands.
In the case of the children, where they are needy, they can have a family that can secure them a safe future.
Among other benefits, orphans can have the privilege of growing up in a family and having relatives who would make them feel like any other human.
Though there can be some challenges, generally, adoption is good for those who need it.",,Editorial, 16 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Growth-in-interest-in-child-adoption-good-1946050
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Be sensitive, transparent and urgent in public dealings","We have in our issue today two stories that demand critical attention as they benefit both the government and the public in ways that serve their different interests.
The first story has to do with the tidal waves that have hit Anlo Beach, a fishing community, in the Shama District of the Western Region.
Tidal waves are not new in the country, as they have been occurring in various coastal communities in the country.
For instance, in June last year, some communities in the Volta Region were hit by tidal waves, having suffered similar incidents in 2021.
Any time such tidal wave incidents occur, the government comes in with all manner of assistance and promises to assuage the suffering and fears of the affected communities.
However, later, the victims complain that their expectations have been dashed as the government has failed to honour its word.
For instance, when the June 2023 tidal waves occurred in the Volta Region, an Assembly member of the Amutinu-Salakope area, Kumawu Sylvester, said the government provided relief items to the 2021 victims but did not provide any solutions that would be sustainable.
He said the major solution to this situation is a sea defence wall.
Today, the people of Anlo Beach are also asking for assistance, including resettlement and a sea defence wall, else the area would be totally wiped out.
The Ghanaian Times is aware that the government is undertaking defence projects at such places as Keta, Ada, Sakumono, New Takoradi, Komenda, Elmina, and Cape Coast.
This is commendable, and the paper joins the appeal to include Anlo Beach in the list to reduce the trauma and fear of the people there and give hope that their community will be saved.
The problem is that massive projects like sea defence walls take a long time to complete, and so the beneficiary communities must be educated enough to understand all the related issues.
If this is not done, they may take even the delay as a way to deceive them and thus use the situation to discredit the government.
In fact, if there are people who are not trusted by the general public, politicians are at the top of the list.
In the face of this, politicians must do well to take advantage of every opportune time to prove the people wrong.
Currently, sea defence wall projects are an opportune time to do so.
And this brings the Ghanaian Times to the second related or relevant issue to be touched on in this piece.
The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources says it will soon publish a list of public lands that have been leased out to individuals and private entities by the state since the coming into force of the 1992 constitution on January 7, 1993.
It says the decision, apart from updating the public on the state of public lands, is also to put to rest the perennial accusation and counter-accusation of land grabbing by the political class.
Without going too much into this, we would like to state that it appears the grabbing accusation has become more ingrained in the minds of members of the public.
The problem in this country is that it is very difficult to make politicians take account of their stewardship, and so they have become kings and queens of all they survey.
It is time the countrys managers became sensitive to public plight and opinions, transparent, and showed urgency in all their dealings to attract public trust.",,Editorial, 15 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Be-sensitive-transparent-and-urgent-in-public-dealings-1945865
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Prioritise addressing challenges facing youth!,"International Youth Day is celebrated annually on August 12.
Thus, Monday was International Youth Day 2024.
It is very apt that the Day was established by the United Nations (UN) in 1998 to draw attention to issues young people face as well as celebrate their potential in todays global society.
The youth constitute a diverse group.
It is said that the operational definition and nuances of the term youth vary from country to country, depending on relative sociocultural, institutional, economic, and political factors.
For instance, in Ghana, per its National Youth Policy, the youth bracket comprises people aged 15 to 35 years.
However, it is accepted that youth everywhere have some unique characteristics that cannot be discounted in nation-building.
They are young people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, including being energetic, creative, open-minded, and enthusiastic about whatever they do.
These are people who would grow to play pivotal roles in various sectors of the economy or society, so it would be better today if they had the opportunity to hone their talents for the benefit of themselves and the country now and forever.
If the right environment exists in countries, even people younger than the age bracket Ghana considers the youth group, and those within it who are relatively young, can be of benefit to society through the use of their creative abilities.
For instance, history has it that people such as Gitanjali Rao from Denver, Colorado, and Benjamin Franklin, who grew to be an accomplished thinker, scientist, and inventor, both at 11, Emma Yang, and George Nissen, a high school gymnast from Iowa.
There may be similar innovations by the youth even in Africa, except that they are yet to be recorded or presented on the global stage, yet it is not in doubt that the youth play significant roles in nation-building.
However, the youth today, particularly those in Africa, face numerous challenges, including lack of employment opportunities, failure to succeed in the education system, family problems, substance abuse, the pressures of materialism, poverty, a lack of affordable housing, negative stereotyping, and crime.
These problems may not be new, but compared to the times of old, they have become so pronounced today that a good number of the youth do not care about any lifestyle that helps them to survive, especially when there is no help coming from anywhere.
And especially in terms of lack of employment opportunities, poverty, and the pressures of materialism, the youth are employing every means to make a living.
Some of them are, for instance, involved in criminal and illegal activities such as armed robbery, cybercrime, and illegal mining (galamsey), obviously because the devil finds jobs for idle hands.
It is sad that some adults who should know better would rather give these bad people a tacit push to perpetuate their bad ways of life.
Imagine a chief telling the whole world that so long as there are no employment opportunities for the youth in his jurisdiction, they have the right to continue engaging in galamsey.
Meanwhile, the state is spending huge sums fighting galamsey.
What this means is that the challenges facing the youth are creating other problems.
Therefore, it is incumbent on the government to prioritise addressing youth problems in order to eradicate the challenges their precarious situations create for the whole country.",,Editorial, 14 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Prioritise-addressing-challenges-facing-youth-1945657
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: We must reverse baton changeover curse in athletics,"The Worlds most popular multi-sports event, the Olympics games, branded this year Paris 2024, came to a close on Sunday at the Stade de France after 19 days of thrills and excitement.
We are not too surprised that Team Ghana came home empty-handed in the events we participated in.
Of course, we cannot reap where we have not sown, but suffice it to commend our team for their participation and competing with the best in the world.
We at the Ghanaian Times cannot be happy with the teams performance; our disappointment stems from the comedy of errors in high-profile athletic events, especially in the relay race.
Ghana has been consistent in the sprint and 4100 meter events at the Olympics and other international multi-sport events and has gained an appreciable level of experience and inspiration.
So, the whole nation was hopeful that the relay team at Paris 2024 would make the country proud by mounting the podium to collect a medal after the countrys poor performance in the boxing, swimming, and female high jump events.
But our history of baton exchange mishaps reared its ugly head in the team again.
The relay quartet of Abdul-Rasheed Saminu, Benjamin Azamati, Ibrahim Fuseini, and Joseph Paul Amoah put up a strong show in the semifinals, crossing the line in the 4100 meters at 38.62 seconds in the sixth position, but was disqualified for exchanging the baton outside the designated exchange zone.
The baton exchange delay slowed the quartets momentum, and with that incident, the countrys last hope of winning a medal came crashing down and ended the dream of another eventful game.
In athletics, baton changeover is very crucial because it is vital to maintaining speed and momentum in the race, so the rules are strictly adhered to, especially with the application of technology.
We recall that at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, our relay quartet was disqualified for a baton exchange error.
We suffered similar baton exchange errors at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Games, which took place in 2021 due to the disruption of events by COVID-19, the World Athletic Championship in 2021, and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022.
Sadly, back home in Ghana in March, during the 13th Africa Games at the University of Ghana Stadium, Accra, a baton exchange hitch between the third leg Solomon Hammond and the anchor, Joseph Paul Amoah, robbed our quartet of gold medals, which Nigeria eventually won in the finals of the 4100 relay.
We at the Ghanaian Times are extremely worried about this trend in our athletics.
We believe it is time we overcame what appears to be a baton changeover curse.
Ghanaian teams are no novices in track and field events, and we wonder why this issue of baton exchange keeps recurring anytime they participate in high-profile sports.
The history of baton exchange errors by our 4100 relay teams is embarrassing; it appears the teams have not been learning lessons from previous failures to improve upon that crucial segment of the relay race in subsequent events.
Be that as it may, we still have confidence in our athletes to get over this difficulty through improved training in baton exchange techniques and communication.
We expect that in subsequent outings at such major athletic events, the countrys teams will have eradicated their nemesis and had a seamless baton changeover in the relay race.",,Editorial, 13 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-We-must-reverse-baton-changeover-curse-in-athletics-1945477
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Using Homowo Festival to restore Accra to its greatness is good idea,"At a Homowo durbar of chiefs and elders of the Gbese Traditional Area in Accra over the weekend, the Gbese Mantse, Nii Ayi-Bonte, urged the people to unite in their efforts to restore Accra to its greatness.
He explained that Homowo was not a period only for merrymaking but for deep introspection and reflections on the past, present, and future.
Nii Ayi-Bonte said it was very important for the people of Ga Mashie and Greater Accra, in general, to pause and take stock, reflecting on why it was lagging behind in its development despite being the national capital.
We must celebrate this years Homowo, but we must not only make merry; we must also reflect on our past, present, and future and also find ways we will unite to build Accra, he stressed.
In the sentiments expressed by the Gbese Mantse, who is also the Adonteng of the Ga State, he could not have chosen any other platform than the one offered by the Homowo festival, which is celebrated by the Ga-Dangme people in the Greater Accra Region.
Indeed, while congratulating the Gas for celebrating another festival, we would like to add our voice to the call by the Gbese Mantse, which we believe is also shared by all well-meaning indigenes and Ghanaians at large.
It goes without saying that the Ga state is a pale shadow of its past due to a myriad of factors, some of which are self-inflicted. Besides the many challenges faced by the Ga state being imposed by virtue of its being the capital city, conflicts, particularly chieftaincy and family feuds, have played a major role in the state of affairs in the Greater Accra Region.
It is heartwarming, however, that some of the chiefs have begun to take pragmatic steps towards mobilising the people to change course towards a path that would restore the region to its rightful place.
We have seen in recent times the mobilisation of the people to embark on a massive cleanup exercise, the settlement of disputes, collective efforts to recover property from the state, and many other initiatives to restore Accra to where it belongs.
These and many social intervention policies to empower the youth and build the human resource base would surely contribute positively to changing the narrative for the Ga state.
Once again, we commend Nii Gbese and all Ga-Dangmes on this auspicious occasion and wish that the path to recovery would be smooth to restore Accra to its greatness.",,Editorial, 12 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Using-Homowo-Festival-to-restore-Accra-to-its-greatness-is-good-idea-1945265
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Call for transparency in security service recruitment apt!,"The call by security analysts for transparency and professionalism in the selection of personnel for the various security services in the country is apt and one to be treated with all seriousness.
Of late, there has been hullabaloo about recruitment into the security services regarding the hijacking of the process by politicians.
For instance, in May this year, the Minority in Parliament alleged that the government had adopted a scheme in which each
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) parliamentary candidate had been offered 30 slots for enlistment into the various security services in the country.
Even though public agencies or organisations like the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) and the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE) play roles that contribute to the social stability and security of the country, the mention of security services readily comes to mind for the ordinary Ghanaian, including the
Ghana Police Service
(GPS), the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF), and the Ghana Immigration Service (GIS).
The rest are the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS), Ghana Prisons Service (GPS), Bureau of National Investigations (BNI), and Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA).
These are sources of employment that should be open to all eligible Ghanaians, especially the youth, to apply for enlistment.
Therefore, if any person(s), group(s), and organization(s) arrogate to themselves the power and authority to enlist groups of people, then there is marginalization and unfairness somewhere, which does not augur well for national cohesion and unity.
In fact, even before the Minority in Parliament cried foul, following which the Majority debunked the allegation, rumours were rife that some people in government and others with some kind of clout were either collecting bribes personally or had appointed assigns who were collecting them from people desperate to secure placements in the various security services.
The reality is that there are some people who are desperate to become security personnel and so allegedly pay bribes to one agent or a number of them to get them placements in any security service whose doors get open.
Emanating from this state of affairs is also the fact that some applicants have been swindled.
Even though the Ghanaian Times is not giving credence to the rumours, it cannot dismiss them outright and so calls for investigations into them, while the recruitment process is made to be characterized by the kind of transparency the security experts are calling for and which calls are shared by the general public.
The truth is that if fraud associated with recruitment into the security services is not eliminated, there is a likelihood that criminals (including traitors) and physically unfit persons can be enlisted, and that can affect the integrity, fitness, and even the safety of the services and the country.
Besides, there can be the concentration of particular groups of persons from certain tribes, political parties, or otherwise, which can undermine the cohesion and unity of the services and give impetus to discrimination.
But while the Ghanaian Times hopes the fraud will be eliminated, it believes it is a good thing the government does not want new application forms to be sold to the public but wishes to know how the 2021 applicants being considered now would be treated.",,Editorial,  9 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Call-for-transparency-in-security-service-recruitment-apt-1944874
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Sissala, other areas need good roads","Residents of communities along the Tumu-Sakai-Walembelle-Wa road in the Sissala East Municipality of the Upper West Region have expressed serious worries about the poor nature of the road and others in the area.
They have, therefore, appealed to the government to give the road a facelift to ease the movement of people and goods.
Among other functions, roads help producers send their products to markets, get workers to their workplaces, students to school, and the sick to hospitals.
That is to say, roads are a vital resource that helps society accomplish various endeavours.
In a word, roads are vital to an individuals wellbeing and progress, with the aggregate effect positively impacting national development.
Because of the importance of roads to societal wellbeing, members of society who find themselves deprived of or denied roads, and good ones at that, would not cease complaining about the situation.
Thus, the complaints of the people in the Sissala East Municipality about the poor state of a principal road in their area must be of serious concern to the countrys managers.
Listening to the details of the complaints, one cannot help but conclude that the poor nature of the Tumu-Sakai-Walembelle-Wa road, in particular, is hindering the movement of goods and services to where they are needed most, including marketing centres in neighbouring Burkina Faso.
This means efforts to ensure productivity in the area do not end as expected because if agricultural yields are not marketed, they go to waste and the implications are dire economically, while the situation kills the morale of producers.
Similarly, it becomes very frustrating if people cannot access places where their services are needed, mostly because of the lack of good roads.
It is pathetic to learn that the bad state of the roads in the Sissala area has made it nearly impossible for trucks, which cart large and heavy cargo, to access the roads there.
Meanwhile, residents are forced to rely on motorcycles for travel and tricycles (aboboyaa) to cart goods.
There are similar cases of poor roads across the country, and there is one phenomenon about public projects and changes of government that must cease forthwith if the country is to see even development.
If the narrative is true that the
John Dramani Mahama
administration awarded the Tumu-Sakai-Walem-belle road on contract to Fuzak Construction Company Limited in 2015 but work came to a standstill after the Akufo-Addo administration took power, then this is bad and primitive.
However, the Ghanaian Times hopes the President Akufo-Addo governments District Road Improvement Programme (DRIP), launched on July 30, 2024, will help right the wrongs in the road sector, including the continuation of road projects even when there is a change in government at any time.
The DRIP is meant to facilitate the free movement of goods and services, enhance easy transportation of farm produce to market areas, and open new markets for farmers.
Just yesterday, the Municipal Chief Executive of Ketu South, Mr. Maxwell Lugudor, said at Denu-Tokor in the Volta Region that the DRIP is not a political gimmick but a game-changer to transform Ghana.
It is the hope of every Ghanaian that it will be so because the country needs a good road network to boost development.",,Editorial,  8 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Sissala-other-areas-need-good-roads-1944642
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Deepen education on exclusive breastfeeding,"This years Breastfeeding Week, which officially began on Thursday last week, ends today.
Nature has endowed women with the ability to breastfeed children because of its benefits for both the mother and the child.
However, history suggests that at some point, some women wanted to run away from their unique God-given duty.
Therefore, some leaders of old imposed breastfeeding on women to the extent that even during the time of the pharaohs, breastfeeding a neonate by a woman who was not the mother was promoted.
In modern times, although women generally know breastfeeding is better for the baby, a good number of them choose to bottle-feed due to negative attitudes toward breastfeeding, conflicting responsibilities or schedules, convenience, negative breastfeeding experiences, and health or medical reasons.
Others copy those not breastfeeding their babies and choose to bottle-feed.
Obviously not satisfied with the negative attitudes towards breastfeeding, the Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) introduced World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) and first celebrated it in 1992.
Now, the celebration is observed in over 120 countries by the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and their partners, including individuals, organisations, and governments, from August 17 annually.
The week is meant to raise awareness and galvanise action on themes related to breastfeeding.
The theme for 2024 is ""Closing the Gap: Breastfeeding Support for All.""
On this theme, the WHO and UNICEF are emphasising the need for governments and society in general to improve breastfeeding support as a critical action for reducing health inequity and protecting the rights of mothers and babies to survive and thrive.
They say that when breastfeeding is protected and supported, women are more than twice as likely to breastfeed their infants.
They further say breastfeeding is a shared responsibility for families, communities, healthcare workers, policymakers, and other decision-makers.
One of the practices that WBW stresses is exclusive breastfeeding, which means feeding your baby only breast milk and not any other foods or liquids (including infant formula or even water), except for medications or vitamin and mineral supplements.
The WHO states that breastfeeding has many health benefits for both the mother and infant.
It says breast milk contains all the nutrients an infant needs in the first six months of life, so infants should be exclusively breastfed during this period to achieve optimal growth, development, and good health.
The Global Health Body explains that breastfeeding protects against diarrhoea and common childhood illnesses such as pneumonia and may also have longer-term health benefits for the mother and child, such as reducing the risk of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence.",,Editorial,  7 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Deepen-education-on-exclusive-breastfeeding-1944427
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Investigate allegations of closed fishing season flouting!!,"Yesterday, brisk business activities resumed at the various landing sites in the countrys coastal belt, comprising the Volta, Greater Accra, Central, and Western regions.
After a month of lull in fishing activities, fishermen and fishmongers can now rise again and do what they know best as their way of fending for themselves and also contributing to the development of the country.
This means all those who make a living from the fishing value chain have the benefit of resuming their livelihoods.
The lifting of the one-month ban on fishing is a great opportunity for Ghanaians to have the option of choosing to enjoy ocean-fresh fish rather than getting pinned down to eating only frozen fish.
The Ghanaian Times appreciates all these good things associated with the lifting of the ban but wishes to call attention to a broad issue relating to the closed fishing season.
The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development annually demands compliance with the one-month closed season for a good purpose.
According to the Ministry, the annual temporary ban is a strategy to recover fish stock and allow for the regeneration of fish stock in the countrys waters.
Therefore, artisanal fishing activities in the countrys waters have to be suspended within the one-month period; hence, it comes as a sabotage of the noble objective of the ban when some fishermen flout it.
The issue the Ghanaian Times wants to talk about has to do with what the Volta Regional Chairman of the Ghana National Canoe Fishermen Council (GNCFC), Mr. Doe Nkekeshie, has said.
According to him, the closed season did not achieve the fullness of its intended purpose because some fishermen ignored the ban and continued to engage in fishing activities during the season.
Mr. Nkekeshie has also alleged that some fishermen have simultaneously registered as members of the National Canoe Fishermen Council in Ghana and with other fishing associations in neighbouring Togo, explaining that such fishermen sneaked into Ghanaian waters during the closed season and engaged in illegal fishing activities.
This is heinous and must not be treated as business as usual, especially because such nation-wreckers escaped the lenses and the arrest of the marine police, who were believed to be patrolling the territorial waters of the country during the period.
The Ghanaian Times joins Mr. Nkekeshie in wondering why there was no arrest of these fishermen who engaged in acts he describes as illegal and prosecuted them to give full meaning to the closed fishing season practice.
We think Mr. Nkekeshies pronouncements must not be treated as mere allegations and dismissed.
Let the authorities investigate the allegations and bring the culprits, if any, to book to exemplify how serious the country is with the closed fishing season and also serve as a deterrent to prospective offenders.
If it is true, then the crossing of fishermen from the Ada area in the Greater Accra Region into Volta Region waters to engage in illegal light-fishing during the closed season but escape arrest by marine police also needs heavy condemnation.
What do the Ada fishermen mean?
Do they want the world to believe that fishermen from the Volta Region are not law-abiding?",,Editorial,  2 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Investigate-allegations-of-closed-fishing-season-flouting-1943679
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Give special education attention,"It will be mere propaganda if anyone discounts the improvements in Ghanas education sector over the last seven years under the Akufo-Addo administration.
There is no doubt the transformation is evident in various areas, such as the Free Senior High School programme and the increase in infrastructure.
The government has every right to boast that it has made education better than it was before.
Of course, that should be the case because Ghanaians voted for political parties to come in to improve the sectors that support life in the country.
This is the case everywhere in the world, so that is not a novelty.
Novelty comes in when the unexpected happens in a particular country, just like Nana Akufo-Addo has introduced and sustained the Free Senior High School system in the country since he took office in 2017.
As we have already acknowledged, the government has done great in the education sector, but the country still has a long way to go.
For example, so far, there has not been any mention of improvement in public special schools.
Elsewhere, governments are doing all they can to help children with disabilities that prevent them from doing well in regular schools, but it appears not much is being done in the country.
Some children in regular schools have learning difficulties, but because they do not have visible signs of disabilities like blindness and speech disorders, they are ignored, and their peers stigmatise them as idiots or nonentities.
The country needs to begin screening all children as they start school to identify those suffering from hidden difficulties and plan a better way of getting all children properly educated, even if it is in regular schools for those who may need just remedial teaching.
Definitely, some children need complete special school attention and so must be placed in special schools like the School for the Blind at Akuapem Akropong.
How many public special schools can the country boast of?
It is sad to hear that even the very few lack the appropriate infrastructure and modern teaching facilities.
It is sadder to hear that the government delayed releasing the stipend for the upkeep of these unfortunate fellow humans.
We expect improvements in special schools in the country, and these should include upgrading their facilities, establishing more of them, and easing bureaucracy in matters concerning them.
Also, there should be special incentives for teachers who choose to teach and take care of these unfortunate children, who, through no fault of their own, are in this dire condition.
Another ignored reality about education in Ghana is that most public junior high school (JHS) products cannot read, and even most of those who attempt to read cannot do any effective reading, so they are not performing well in school subjects.
It is obvious something is seriously wrong with both teaching and learning, and therefore with teachers and learners, which needs to be effectively addressed.
There are other realities, including the lack of laws that can bind education authorities, teachers, learners, parents, and the entire community to support the development of education in the country, which need to be addressed.
But while state authorities plan to address realities that are ignored in improving education, the Ghanaian Times wishes to appeal that special education be given the particular attention it deserves.",,Editorial,  1 August 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Give-special-education-attention-1943483
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Be swift with plans to reduce LPG prices,"It is the fervent prayer of The Ghanaian Times that plans by the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) to make Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) more affordable and accessible to all Ghanaians will come to pass sooner than expected.
It is good news that the NPA has identified the fact of the ever-rising prices of LPG on the market as the cause leading many Ghanaians, particularly those in rural areas, to rely on the use of fuel wood such as charcoal.
The NPA believes that if it ensures LPG is always available and its prices are within the reach of the ordinary Ghanaian family, people can be dissuaded from using wood for fuel.
All stakeholders in this matter must make the necessary efforts, and urgently too, to see through the NPA plan because it has serendipitous benefits beyond its intended objectives.
The NPA reducing LPG prices was crucial for the success of the Cylinder Recirculation Model (CRM), which basically aims to make LPG more accessible and affordable.
The CRM, among other actions, would make sure LPG is on the doorstep of consumers.
To do this, the CRM would engage some unemployed youth and involve them in the distribution and exchange of LPG cylinders, thereby creating employment opportunities and reducing the countrys unemployment burden.
It is clear that the NPA means business; to facilitate the CRM, it has supervised the establishment of four bottling plants and issued licenses for a number of cylinder exchange points and other relevant infrastructure.
This move is sort of meant to bypass the frightening costs Petroleum Distribution Companies (PDC) and Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) have to incur to obtain licenses to distribute LPG, a situation that has become a barrier to many aspiring LPG entrepreneurs.
Just imagine that to obtain a PDC license, one has to pay an entrance fee of US$ 750,000 and own seven filling stations, and for an OMC license, one needs to own three filling stations and four state-of-the-art filling stations, with each station costing not less than GH5 million to set up.
The serendipitous nature of the whole CRM matter begins with its goal that by the year 2030, at least 50 percent of Ghanaian households should be using LPG as their primary cooking method.
This target is in line with the UNs Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, as it calls for ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.
SDG 7.1.2, in particular, highlights access to clean cooking solutions.
It is on record that in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, the population growth is higher than the growth in the number of people with access to clean cooking, leaving more than three-quarters of the population without access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.
It is public knowledge that the acquisition of wood fuel in developing countries often causes forest degradation, and its use by rural households results in respiratory diseases and eye ailments, where the ensuing smoke is intense.
In the face of this, cleaner cooking options are obviously needed to solve these problems, and The Ghanaian Times thinks the CRM and all the related good plans of the NPA come in handy for that unavoidable purpose.",,Editorial, 31 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Be-swift-with-plans-to-reduce-LPG-prices-1943303
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Speed up process to grant EPA authority status!,"The  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reiterated its move to attain authority status, explaining that there is a bill to that effect which is at the consideration stages in
Parliament
.
The Ghanaian Times thinks such a move, disclosed first by the then Executive Director of EPA, Dr. Henry Kwabena Kokofu, during a UK-Ghana Chamber of Commerce's (UKGCC) webinar on February 29, 2024, is in order because it will give the agency autonomy to discharge functions more effectively.
Authority status attracts people and provides exemptions or privileges which regular agencies do not have.
This is obviously one major reason why the EPA wants to be transformed into an authority, as, according to it, that status will strengthen its regulatory functions and prosecutorial powers to bite harder.
For instance, according to Dr. Kokofus submission, the EPA can have the power of arrest.
It is also agreed that, all things being equal, public-sector organizations deliver better quality and improve efficiency once their managers are given more autonomy in managerial and operational decisions.
The foregoing then supports the EPAs quest to gain authority status, so it can assume that strong leadership can help it have the drive for environmental protection by adopting regulations that can ensure the results its new status is supposed to bring.
There are so many environmental issues that the EPA must be able to address, and its crave for authority status means it is handicapped in handling some of them.
The EPA is the country's leading public entity mandated to protect, co-manage, and improve its environment, backed by the Environmental Protection Agency Act of 1994 (Act 490) with the Environmental Assessment Regulations of 1999 (L.I. 1652) as its enabling legislation.
Its mandate covers both built and natural environments, which encompass the physical and terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric ecosystems.
It undertakes a number of activities in the exercise of its mandate, including conducting environmental impact assessments to evaluate the potential environmental impact of proposed development projects.
Besides, it conducts environmental monitoring of industrial and commercial activities to ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations and issues environmental permits to regulate various projects across different sectors, including energy, mining, agriculture, and manufacturing.
That is to say, businesses whose activities have a potential impact on the environment must register with the EPA, and these include mining, manufacturing concerns, construction, those doing logging, and commercial farming.
To ensure compliance with environmental regulations, the EPA utilises strategies, including embarking on regular compliance and enforcement exercises and monitoring permit schedules.
The EPA is an agency under the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology, and Innovation, so it may happen that the Ministry controls it according to its regular status, which does not give it the leeway to operate as freely as it should, hence the craving for some autonomy.
It can be recalled that while speaking during the UKGCC webinar already referred to, Dr. Kokofu remarked that within a month or so,
Parliament
will approve [the bill for authority status], and the President will assent to it.
The Ghanaian Times hopes there will be no further delays in the process meant to grant the EPA the authority status it craves so much.",,Editorial, 30 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Speed-up-process-to-grant-EPA-authority-status-1943112
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Stem preventable deaths among SHS students,"Man begins to die the very moment he is born, but since some deaths are described as premature, it means such deaths are unacceptable due to the circumstances leading to them.
It is against this background that the deaths of senior high school (SHS) students in the country, which some people think could have been avoided, have raised issues of concern among the public.
It has been reported that four boarding students died in four SHSs between February and July this year due to untreated illnesses worsened by alleged negligence from school authorities.
Commenting on the deaths at Ghana National College, Aburi Girls SHS, Akim Swedru SHS, and Kalpohin SHS at a press conference in Accra days ago, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Child Rights International (CRI), Bright Appiah, recalled that from 2001 to 2017, five other school-related child fatalities were reported, citing causes such as negligence, malaria, and teacher apathy.
He added that the trend was disturbing as it had gone on for many years, showing a pattern of neglect towards the welfare of students, and called for urgent change.
The Ghanaian Times thinks the unavoidable death of even one SHS student is too many to be acceptable, and so urgent attention needs to be paid to the issue of deaths in SHSs.
Listening to the lamentations of the CEO of the CRI, the Ghanaian Times thinks the situation is serious and really needs urgent attention to save innocent young lives.
As it is the case in modern times, parents want their children educated so they can understand and be part of the modern way of life.
Thus, at some point, the children would attend SHS, and where they are boarders, school authorities would need to give the children special care.
This means school authorities must be up-to-date with facilities that ensure the total welfare of the children, especially things that underpin their good health, such as food, well-equipped infirmaries, and healthy rules and regulations.
In times past, probably because of low enrolments and healthy environments, the infirmaries were effective, but now the high enrolments may overwhelm the facilities, and this is what the school authorities must be up and doing.
School rules and regulations must cease to be too strict and become hurtful in the end.
Why should granting an exemption, for example, follow a bureaucratic process that creates unnecessary obstacles, potentially worsening health crises by impeding timely intervention like allowing a child to go home for malaria, a treatable disease, to be timely treated to save him from preventable death?
It is sad that some teachers violating students human rights today had the best of care in their school days but are showing apathy towards student wellbeing today.
There is no doubt that the government is doing its bit to improve education in the country.
However, it appears its plans are short of providing facilities to take good care of the students, such as modern infirmaries, and staffing them with well-trained medical professionals who would only do timely referrals in cases beyond them and their facilities.
The government must pay urgent attention to this and also endeavour to eradicate or check negative acts by teachers and school authorities that impede the good lives of both boarding and day students.",,Editorial, 29 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Stem-preventable-deaths-among-SHS-students-1942934
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Lets help EC deliver free, fair, transparent election","The
Electoral Commission
(EC) is one organisation perceived to always be on the side of the government, or, for that matter, the ruling party.
Therefore, it comes as good news that the EC has assured that it is putting measures in place to ensure that the December 7, 2024, polls will be free, fair, and transparent.
This assurance given by the Chairperson of the Commission, Mrs.
Jean Mensa
, at Parliament on Friday is an important message to the whole country.
It appears the EC cannot be trusted by a section of the Ghanaian public, and this section changes depending on which political party is in power.
Meanwhile, since the inception of the countrys Fourth Republic, power has rotated between only the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP).
There is no doubt that Ghana has distinguished itself as a giant in democratic governance among its peers in Africa.
Among other things, this feat is due to the conduct of eight peaceful elections so far, which have ensured a hitch-free transition of power.
In spite of this, every election year, some people attempt to discredit the EC, but it surmounts all odds to pass the test.
This year too, the criticisms against the EC have started in earnest.
The Ghanaian Times thinks it is about time the talebearers outlived that behaviour.
As a human institution, the EC may be found wanting at one time or another.
However, it has to be constructively criticised but not crucified, as it has nothing to show for its credibility.
The problem is that the critics always consider the personalities to be the faces of the community and ascribe certain things to them.
This cannot continue forever, because that would eventually subtract from the countrys democratic achievements, and the result would not be good for the country.
The EC would do all it can to ensure free and fair elections, but its efforts can still be doubted by others if Ghanaians, the people in whose interests it is working, turn around to discredit it.
Meanwhile, it is a great honour for all Ghanaians if the country is touted as being a beacon of democracy in Africa.
If this is so, then every Ghanaian should support the EC to discharge its duties as expected, rather than seek every opportunity to bastardise it.
Therefore, if nothing at all, the assurance given by the EC to conduct another free, fair, and transparent general election must be viewed as an invitation to all Ghanaians to help it just do that.
The truth is that even though the EC is in charge of the conduct of the 2024 general election, its success does not depend on only its efforts but on all of Ghana.
That said, the Ghanaian Times also expects the EC to not do anything in the run-up to the general election to give cause to doubt and speculation that can undermine the countrys electoral credentials.
Let the EC and all Ghanaians safeguard the countrys peace and stability before, during, and after this years election.",,Editorial, 22 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-s-help-EC-deliver-free-fair-transparent-election-1941728
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Withdrawal of LI must not end matter!,"Though the peoples power has been in existence since the advent of democracy in the country, it has now begun showing its potency, and the whole nation must sustain it in a non-partisan manner as it helps to ensure good governance and accountability.
Just days ago, the peoples power forced the curtailment of the sale to a private company of the 60-percent stake the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) holds in four state hotels.
The latest episode of the force of the peoples power is the public outcry against the Legislative Instrument (LI) seeking to amend portions of the Road Traffic Regulations, 2012 (LI 2180), which has caused its withdrawal.
The withdrawal of the LI must not end there because attention must be called to certain matters arising from the whole issue.
It is clear that public officials, particularly politicians, who have been given the peoples (state) power to solve problems beyond the remit and capacity of the masses have shirked their responsibilities and yet want ways to avoid the difficulties associated with challenges that have resulted from their own negligence, ineptness, or inaction.
The major reason for the gridlocks in the country, which certain Members of
Parliament
(MPs) want some categories of public officials to avoid, is the lack of proper spatial planning, something the district assemblies, particularly the metropolitans and municipals, have woefully failed to check.
If there were access roads or even streets everywhere in the cities and big towns, the country would not suffer the kind of disturbing traffic jams that some people want to escape.
Everyone living in the country, under normal circumstances, should experience all the difficulties in it so that duty-bearers would do all in their power to ensure the needful rather than shirk their responsibilities with nothing to suffer or lose for that.
There is another matter to look into.
Why should the LI be concealed from the Speaker of
Parliament
, Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin, until it causes a controversy on social media?
How was the LI going to pass without the authority of the Speaker backing it?
The Speakers explanation that even if, for example, the House disagrees with one provision in an LI, legislators are not allowed to amend it but can either throw out the whole LI or allow it to pass is a clear indication that some state officials are arrogating to themselves powers they do not possess.
Such people, when found out as it has happened in
Parliament
, must be sanctioned, and we expect that at parliament to serve as a deterrent to public officials everywhere in the country.
It is not the best when public officials wield absolute power, which gives them the privilege to be even more lawless.
Besides, for the Minister of Local Government, Decentralization, and Rural Development, Martin Adjei-Mensah Korsah, to say that the withdrawal of the now controversial LI was a result of extensive consultations smacks of a lack of critical considerations in the lawmakers work.
This deserves condemnation because it gives the impression that
Parliament
can take the people for granted and pass laws that favour a class of people deemed to be better human beings than the people in whom state power resides, and this is a serious blunder.",,Editorial, 18 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Withdrawal-of-LI-must-not-end-matter-1941186
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Give child healthcare particular attention!,"Children, they say, are the future of every nation, and if this axiom is in dispute, then governments, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, must begin to question themselves about whether they are taking care of their children enough.
If these children fare well and become responsible adults, they will harness their knowledge and skills for their own good and the good of their families, communities, and the country at large.
The contributions of some of them, as is the case with some adults today, would save governments some burdens.
For instance, in Ghana, some of them would take care of their poor family members and save the government the payment of Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) allowances to these family members.
The Ghanaian Times is raising this issue today because of a feature story it published yesterday, which talks about children suffering and some dying from kidney diseases.
The story, on page 14, under the headline Dying Young: Tragic Realities of Child Kidney Patients in Ghana, illustrates some of the sufferings of these child kidney patients and the harrowing experiences of their parents.
It is a must-read that can help save even some adults suffering from kidney diseases if readers take it seriously and come together to prevail on the government to provide the needed assistance in caring for kidney disease patients in the country, especially the poor.
The Ghanaian Times is aware that there are other equally distressing conditions being suffered by children, such as hole-in-heart.
However, it has chosen to call attention to kidney diseases as a point of reference to prompt the government to take a serious view of the good health of all children in the country by providing the necessary facilities and financial support.
According to the article in reference, a nine-year-old Pona Tagan, born in the village of Nadundo, a farming community in the Mion District of the Northern Region, sadly succumbed to kidney disease in May 2023.
And doctors say her death could have been avoided, or at least she would have lived a little longer if there had been dialysis machines specifically for children to aid her treatment.
This brings up issues about the availability of facilities and support for child medical care.
Is it not devastating to hear that many children like Pona have perished due to the lack of dialysis machines specifically for children?
What a danger when the article states that, Even for children over five, the few available machines in certain regions (of Ghana) are intended for adults, yet they are used for children, increasing the risk of death?
It is even more troubling to learn that the appropriate tubes for dialysing children are not available, so adult-sized tubes are used instead, making the already painful and strenuous procedure even more difficult and complicated for children.
It is explained that this leaves them frail, tired, weak, and struggling to breathe after each dialysis.
However, the problem is not yet over, as the cost of treatment is a huge burden for most parents because each dialysis session starts at about GH700.00.
According to the experts, efficient dialysis means three sessions per week, which amounts to GH2,100.00 for one person per week and totals GH8,400.00 in a month.
This is not a poor mans disease, so the government must heed calls to include its treatment in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).
Also, the government must do well to provide child-specific dialysis facilities to help treat children suffering from kidney diseases.
Then, the powers that be should check the causes of kidney diseases in the country, particularly the use of mercury in mining, which is increasing kidney disease cases in mining communities in the country.",,Editorial, 17 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Give-child-healthcare-particular-attention-1940981
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Resolve outstanding issues to stem chaos!!,"Since Friday, people concerned with the progress of Ghana have been worried about the industrial action declared that day by organised labour to begin Monday (yesterday).
Their concerns were in respect of what would happen to the state if Ghana did not emerge, and the strike became as indefinite as it had been declared to be.
It would be recalled that in its editorial yesterday, the Ghanaian Times called for cool heads and dialogue to resolve the matter between organized labour and the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT).
The Ghanaian Times is, therefore, happy that organised labour called off its indefinite strike by public-sector workers to protest the sale of SSNITs 60 percent stake in four hotels.
The hotels are Labadi Beach, La Palm Beach, Royal Ridge, and Elmina Beach, which are going to be sold to a private operator, Rock City Hotel, owned by Bryan
Acheampong, a minister in the incumbent government.
The Ghanaian Times commends organised labour, comprising 10 labour unions, for their willingness to call off their indefinite strike.
This is a clear show of patriotism because if the unions had not given in, all the public could imagine would be chaos in the public sector system.
With reference to this papers banner story, which narrates the accounts of the absence of workers from their workplaces, including schools and hospitals, members of the public can now guess the dire consequences the indefinite strike would have brought about.
From all indications, though it ended the very day it was started, the strike by organised labour can pass as a successful one.
This is because it has caused certain actions to be taken and others to be expected to follow, such as Rock City Hotel's decision not to go ahead and purchase SSNITs stake in the four hotels.
The Ghanaian Times thinks some amount of accountability has been secured, and organised labour must, henceforth, show such fire in matters of public interest to demand accountability for themselves and on behalf of the voiceless, who have been taken for granted for far too long by public institutions and officials, including politicians.
These institutions and their officials must be reminded that they have just been given the privilege to apply state power, but the real power resides in the people.
The Ghanaian Times, at this point, joins Dr. Yaw Baah, Secretary General of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), in expressing gratitude to all the working people of Ghana and all organised labour groups for their support for the strike.
Yours is a show of gallantry and a call to the powers that be that the status quo must change if they want to have peace of mind.
Those who care must learn a lesson from what has happened: there is some power residing in the people, which many refuse to regard as having potency but which can be very destructive, and the results would have ramifications for the whole country.
Organised labour has not hidden its intentions to rekindle its protest if outstanding issues affecting workers are not addressed by SSNIT.
The Ghanaian Times expects that SSNIT will abide by the one-month ultimatum given by organised labour and do the needful, giving organised labour advance notice if one thing or another cannot be done within the period.
This should be the case in order to not give organised labour cause to advise themselves.",,Editorial, 16 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Resolve-outstanding-issues-to-stem-chaos-1940777
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Dialogue to halt Organised Labour strike!,"A group of labour unions coming together as organised labour has announced its intention to begin a nationwide strike today to protest the proposed sale of 60 percent of shares held by the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) in some four hotels.
The unions include the University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG), the Ghana Medical Association (GMA), the Ghana Registered Nurses and Midwives Association (GRNMA), the Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), and the National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT).
Others are the Public Utility Workers Union (PUWU), the Civil and Local Government Staff Association of Ghana (CLOGSAG), the Teachers and Educational Workers Union (TEWU), the Judicial Service Staff Association of Ghana (JUSAG), and the General Transport, Petroleum, and Chemical Workers Union.
The leadership of organized labor has, therefore, directed their members to stay away from work for as long as SSNIT fails to cancel the controversial hotel sale.
The hotels at the centre of the controversy are La Palm Beach Hotel, Labadi Beach Hotel, Royal Ridge Hotel, and Elmina Beach Hotel.
Once again, The Ghanaian Times reiterates its stance that a strike, like a demonstration, is a democratic tool available to members of society, including labour unions, to express their grievances with regard to anything they deem to be negatively affecting their welfare and well-being.
Thus, it does rush to condemn strikes or demonstrations but looks at the related issues and comments appropriately, usually appealing to cool heads.
Regarding the present matter, The Ghanaian Times can conclude that organized labor was not consulted before the process to sell SSNIT stakes in the hotels began, hence the protest.
Even though SSNIT is an independent entity and cannot be controlled by labour unions, it should understand that workers are its greatest stakeholders because it is their monthly contributions that give SSNIT the financial muscle to operate.
But for the law that binds workers, particularly those in the formal sector, to pay a percentage of their incomes to SSNIT towards their retirement, some of them would have abandoned SSNIT for certain reasons.
For instance, the 2019 report of an eight-member committee set up by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to look into the SSNIT Pension Scheme identified gaps in the computation of pension benefits by the Trust.
The report, among other things, adds that the SSNIT Pension is low because SSNIT has misinterpreted the Pension Law, which has resulted in low payment of pensions, thus making the contributors worse off.
The report confirms conversations among SSNIT retirees, which contributors in active service hear and wish a change would come one day.
Thus, any move by the Trust deemed suspicious and likely to affect SSNIT investments made with workers money and the future of workers would definitely be opposed by workers.
The only way out of such a situation, as it is with the present case, is to employ dialogue and ensure transparency while entrenched positions are eased.
It is the hope that once this is done in the current hotel sale saga, it will help halt the organized labor strike; otherwise, it would have dire consequences for the country, considering the kind of professionals involved and the essential services they provide.",,Editorial, 15 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Dialogue-to-halt-Organised-Labour-strike-1940581
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Urgently find antidote to invasion of strange mosquitoes,"The invasion of a new breed of mosquitoes causing illness in four districts in the Eastern Region should be a great concern not only to experts who should find an antidote to the situation but also to the rest of the country.
The districts are Akyeamansa, Achiasi, Birim South, and Birim Central, and so far, at least 300 people have been taken ill from the bites of the mosquitoes.
It is very good that the District Chief Executives (DCEs) of the affected four assemblies in the Eastern Region have called on the
Ghana Health Service
(GHS) to help curb the invasion of the new breed of mosquitoes.
The mosquitoes, typically found on cocoa farms, are said to be large and black with some whitish markings.
The reports of the DCEs have come in timely because they have prompted the
Ghana Health Service
(GHS) to put together a team to investigate the situation and the findings used to address it.
We believe in the competence of the GHS in dealing with a situation like this because it has handled a similar situation before.
It will be recalled that in April last year, the GHS confirmed the presence in the country of a new mosquito species, Anopheles Stephensi, described as a malaria-transmitting species.
The GHS investigated it and came up with the characteristics that made it unique among already-known malaria-transmitting mosquito species.
For instance, the GHS said Anopheles Stephensi had the ability to breed in a variety of sources besides the traditional sites noted for the breeding of Anopheles.
Then, in addition, it could survive in extremely high temperatures during the dry season, when malaria transmission usually declines, making it difficult to control.
However, the GHS formed a task force to coordinate and advise on actions to combat Anopheles and then called on its partners to support intensifying education, particularly environmental management, to reduce all the sites conducive to breeding mosquitoes, while it continued to monitor the spread of Anopheles Stephensi.
Then it advised the public to take precautions such as sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets, using mosquito repellents, and wearing clothing that protects people from mosquito bites outside their homes.
We believe GHS would, as usual, follow the best practice measures in dealing with the current situation, but until its investigations are completed, we do not think it would be wrong for the public to follow existing measures used to combat mosquito invasion.
Thus, we think that to start with, all cocoa farms must be sprayed and other existing measures followed, including seeking medical care.
Therefore, those bitten by the new species of mosquitoes yet to be identified must seek medical care rather than do self-medication.
Our only appeal is that the GHS should work with the urgency the situation deserves and stop the rising numbers of cases being recorded in the four districts before they spread to other parts of the country.",,Editorial,  5 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Urgently-find-antidote-to-invasion-of-strange-mosquitoes-1938951
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Speakers call for support for media apt,"Advocates of democracy and good government would not stop calling for the media to play its role in society.
This role encompasses various functions, simply put, such as informing, educating, and entertaining the public, and these broad functions have various tasks that ensure their fulfilment.
For instance, under the function of informing society, the media has to provide citizens with information they can use to check government power or demand accountability from it.
In fact, it is this particular duty that has earned the media the accolade the Fourth Estate of the Realm,""  which duty it fulfils unofficially when it is considered that the Constitution has established the Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary as the official arms of government.
The truth is that even an aspect of the work of the media is onerous and needs great support to do it.
It is in the face of this that we want to commend the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin, for calling for urgent support for the Ghanaian media to enable it to deliver on its mandate.
It is important to note that it is very significant when personalities like Mr. Bagbin acknowledge that the Ghanaian media has served as a crucial link between the people and the leadership of the country and that it needs support.
The Speaker appears to have his focus on the medias pivotal and critical role in the countrys democratic dispensation, and as such, it must not be left to privately fend for itself.
We, however, believe his focus would have shifted to other functions of the media if he were speaking on a different occasion from the public forum organised by the Parliamentary Service Board as part of activities marking 30 years of parliamentary democracy in Ghana.
Also, it would have done the public a lot of good if he had specified the kind of support he expected the media to have.
That notwithstanding, we can suggest that the support can come in the form of ensuring the safety of journalists; upholding the rights of media practitioners, particularly reporters, by imposing swift but just sanctions against those who violate them; sponsoring travel and studies abroad to expose them to international best practices of journalism; easy access to information; and financial support, at least, for state media houses in particular.
In todays digital world, the government must also do well to ensure that all digital platforms provide effective services, as this would aid the work of the media, especially when they have to use the platforms to file stories and spread information.
Mr. Bagbins call on Saturday for the restructuring of the National Media Commission (NMC) to enable it to perform its functions more effectively is not new.
In February 2022, he called for the amendment of the law that established the NMC to make it more powerful in handling matters relating to journalists in the country rather than the police getting into that space.
The Speaker, for instance, expressed concerns about attempts by politicians to regulate the media through the police, explaining that the police could not assume the role of ensuring responsible and ethical journalism.
It is clear the Speaker is repeating his 2022 call for something to be done, and he has good reasons, as the amendment of the NMC law can be another area of support for media practice in the country.",,Editorial,  2 July 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Speaker-s-call-for-support-for-media-apt-1938403
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Dont abandon introducing cement pricing LI!,"One cannot help but describe as good the attempt by the Trade and Industry Minister, KT Hammond, to make the government introduce legislation to control the pricing of cement to protect consumers from haphazard increments in prices by manufacturers.
It is, however, unfortunate that his attempt to submit the Legislative Instrument (LI) to Parliament on Wednesday was blocked for lack of consultation.
We think that being a legislator himself, Mr. Hammond should have gone through the necessary steps, in which case he would have avoided the Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Andrew Asiamah Amoako, telling him to have had pre-laying discussions with stakeholders before bringing the LI to the House.
This sort of drawback situation notwithstanding, we still commend the trade minister for his show of concern for the Ghanaian consumer.
As such, we would like to suggest that he try to add other commodities whose hitting-the-floor prices equally hurt consumers, particularly food items.
We agree, just as Mr. Hammond is saying, that there is a need to appeal to the conscience of cement manufacturers (and the persuasion must be extended to other significant stakeholder groups like those in the food value chain), but attempts must be made to find out why these stakeholders would not budge on selling at affordable prices.
We can guess that factors like duties on imported inputs and the ever-rising cost of other things like labour can restrain industry players from just being benevolent and selling their commodities at affordable prices.
It is a well-known fact that people in business operate for profit, so they do only those things that can bring them profit.
It is also the case that business people in other jurisdictions are given the needed assistance by the government to leverage it to produce at a low cost, which helps to sell at affordable prices.
Such a situation also boosts the image of the government.
The hardship in the country, worsened every day by ever-increasing prices of goods and services, discredits the government every moment, and it would take only mischievous people and nation-wreckers to dismiss this.
Therefore, any attempt by the government to control prices of essential commodities like cement and possibly other building materials must gladden the heart of every Ghanaian.
Thus, every means constitutional and democratic must be adopted in that regard because the high prices of such materials are making it difficult for many Ghanaians to put up houses for their use and rent, as the case may be.
Meanwhile, it is an indisputable fact that in Ghana, it is private individuals who are closing the countrys housing deficit and not the government because houses put up by the state and described as affordable are affordable to only the upper class of society and a small percentage of the middle class.
The rest have to rely on ordinary house owners and no wonder some lower-class members of society live in kiosks and uncompleted structures in urban and peri-urban communities.
While we talk about legislating the control of the prices of goods in the country, we wish to call attention to one important thing Mr. Hammond mentions: the substandard nature of goods.
This implies that the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) is not being strict enough on its quality control or standards checks.
Is that the case? Over to you, GSA!",,Editorial, 28 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Don-t-abandon-introducing-cement-pricing-LI-1937845
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Be guided by Kenya protests!!,"Reports from Kenya have it that mainly youth-led rallies, which started last week protesting a bill proposing various tax hikes, turned violent on Tuesday as the protesters stormed that countrys parliament and burned part of it.
Consequently, the government ordered the police and the military to quell the violence from the protesters, as a result of which one of the reports says 13 protesters have been killed and over 160 are being treated in hospitals and counting.
Certain issues arising from or associated with the whole tax bill matter need particular attention because of the lessons they have for the Kenyan and other African governments.
One of the issues is that, following the protests, the countrys President, William Ruto, has withdrawn the bill and wants it returned to Parliament for more amendment.
Another big issue is that the government appears to be rubbishing the concerns of the people, as, for example, Ruto vehemently disputes the arguments of the protesters that Kenyans are overtaxed, while he has failed to fulfil his own previously promised commitment to address protesters concerns.
On top of this, the government appears peremptory as it does not pay heed to certain pieces of advice regarding the bill.
For instance, condemning the killing of protesters and appealing to the protesters to be cautious, members of the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) said, among other things, that they formally raised very serious concerns about the Finance Bill with the government.
But it failed to address some of their important suggestions.
They also called upon the legislators to be guided by their conscience in addressing the bill and the good of Kenyans, but they went ahead to pass the bill into law for Ruto to assent to it.
It is also the case that it was not only the controversial bill that sparked the rallies but a combination of other factors, such as Kenyans becoming exasperated because the government does not take their concerns into consideration.
Imagine that while Kenyans are made to believe that their country is among East Africas most dynamic economies, a third of its 52 million population lives in abject poverty.
Then, what is equally worrying is that some media entities allow their outlets to be used to freely trivialize important issues in support of the government.
It is on record that two years ago (2022), Kenyan youth were derided as disengaged for failing to register as voters and to turn up for the general election.
Today, the same youth have, to a large extent, chosen a democratic way of participating in governance by demanding accountability, and they are being crushed to death.
The last of the issues we want to raise concerns responses African leaders and their cronies spew out when they are confronted by accountability crises or criticisms.
In a late-night press briefing, Ruto warned that his government would take a tough line against violence and anarchy and that it is not in order or even conceivable that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives, and the institutions established under our constitution and expect to go scot-free.
Is this a response that can calm nerves?
Do you, as an African politician, see the issues regarding the Kenyan tax bill controversy occurring in your country?
We have raised these issues to plead with African leaders that they should show the needed respect to their people and their views and learn to appropriately make them understand why some views cannot be adopted in the circumstances of the day.
The English say, The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general is full of caution. The scars of others should teach us caution. It is a good thing to learn caution from the misfortunes of others.",,Editorial, 27 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Be-guided-by-Kenya-protests-1937663
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Prioritise completion of Axim, other sea defence walls!!","Axim, a coastal town in the Western Region, risks being submerged by the sea if urgent steps are not taken by the government to complete sea defence works being undertaken there.
Axim and surrounding communities suffer high tidal waves and severe flooding, which need immediate cure or solution to save lives, property, and livelihoods.
It is, therefore, appropriate that the call for the commencement of the second phase of the Axim Coastal Protection Project be intensified in every way possible for the government to do the needful to avert looming disasters in the area.
The Axim Coastal Protection Project was started in September 2018 to, among other objectives, protect the community from the continuous effects of tidal waves, aid the development of beaches for the enhancement of recreational and fishing activities, and reclaim land for tourist facilities.
The project scheduled to be completed in 48 months is still not completed after more than 68 monthsmore than 20 months over its scheduled time for completion.
The challenges faced by the people of Axim are similar to those in all the areas in the country where sea defence walls are a must, such as communities in the Ketu South Municipality in the Volta Region.
The public is alive to see the efforts being made by the government to build sea defence walls where needed to protect affected communities from the devastating effects of tidal waves, coastal erosion, and flooding, thereby preventing the loss of lives, property, and livelihoods.
However, the delay in completing projects to register such efforts as having been fruitful is a huge problem that must be solved.
It cannot be ruled out that lack of funds is part of the problem, and this has been an age-old excuse that must be banished from the planning of projects.
We believe prioritising projects based on how seriously or critically they affect human life can help address the situation.
In that case, we believe certain projects, like sea defence walls, must have precedence over others that can wait a bit.
We also believe that due to the countrys weak financial muscle, certain projects must not be started at all or the numbers must be reduced for them to not compete for the limited funding available.
Apart from lack of funds, we think the negative or lackadaisical attitude and ineptitude of some public officials cannot be ruled out.
Do public officials envisage that their actions and inaction can affect the integrity of projects and the schedules for completing them?
It is sad to note that the delays in prosecuting projects add to the cost as prices of goods and services rise by the day.
Besides, the delay postpones the benefits to be derived from public projects, and this is typical of the sea defence projects in the country, which should be addressed.
Any time tidal waves occur, the effects are devastating, and even good-hearted people living far away from the affected areas groan over them.
The Axim problem and others elsewhere must be tackled devoid of any form of partisanship but on the grounds of saving lives, property, and livelihoods, which will enhance the countrys development.",,Editorial, 24 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Prioritise-completion-of-Axim-other-sea-defence-walls-1937075
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check negative human behaviour to preserve environment!!,"The Ghanaian Times supports President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addos call for a collective effort to sustain the gains made under the Green Ghana Project (GGP) over the last three years.
The Green Ghana Project is a tree-planting measure the government of President Akufo-Addo is spearheading to curb the incessant degradation of our forests, which has been ongoing for years.
Most often simply referred to as Green Ghana, it has a designated day for tree-planting, dubbed Green Ghana Day, with the maiden one held on June 11, 2021.
The gains are that since its introduction, over 42 million trees have been planted, while the target for 2024 is 10 million, to make the figure 52 million.
It is obvious no tree-planting exercise will have a 100 percent survival rate, and so the rise in the 67 percent survival rate in 2021 to 81 percent in 2023 is highly commendable.
However, this must not make Ghanaians complacent but forge ahead to increase the rate to at least 98 percent, which means not more than 200,000 of the trees should die.
The Ghanaian Times thinks if this happens, it will be a sign that Ghanaians are now serious about sustaining their green environment.
This point is being made on the basis that Green Ghana is not a novelty project to sustain the countrys environment, but the previous measures obviously did not get the needed attention and support.
Thus, it has become imperative for every Ghanaian to heed President Akufo-Addos call to ensure the success of the GGP.
It can be recalled that there had been such previous measures as the 1994 Forest and Wildlife Policy to replace that of 1948; the 2012 Ghana Forest and Wildlife Policy to replace the 1994 Forest and Wildlife Policy; the 1999 Forest Plantation Development Fund established to support the private sector with funding for commercial forest plantation investment; the 2001 National Forest Plantation Development Programme; and its relaunch in 2010 to plant about 30,000 hectares of trees per year in all administrative municipals of the country.
There is a need to find out why all these laudable initiatives failed to give cause for the introduction of Green Ghana and see how the lessons can guide the GGP to success.
Generally, it is said that climate change, human behaviour, and institutional factors like policy and governance failure undermine measures to ensure environmental sustainability.
In the face of this, the government cannot just call for support but also check factors that unnecessarily deplete the countrys green environment, such as indiscriminate felling of trees and galamsey, which the government is already seriously fighting.
After all, the experts say climatic and institutional factors can be controlled when laws and regulations guiding behaviour are effective.
The Ghanaian Times thinks advocacy can also play a significant role, so public education about the need to preserve the environment must be increased and sustained.
It is likely that if people are made to appreciate the ecosystem services the green environment provides, such as cleaning the air, purifying water, reducing chemical and noise pollution, and cooling the streets, as well as the economic loss valued in billions of dollars when the environment is not preserved, their support for Green Ghana will come readily.",,Editorial, 10 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-negative-human-behaviour-to-preserve-environment-1935026
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Address issue of squatters settlements,"Fire outbreaks have become common in certain places in Accra, such as Circle and Kantamanto Market, mainly due to careless behaviour like overloading electricity extension boards or sockets or leaving a fire unattended to.
Since such carelessness persists, particularly in the markets and shanty settlements, it did not come as a surprise when more than 450 wooden structures that served as homes to some squatters along the Circle-Accra rail line were destroyed by fire on Wednesday.
Even though the inferno rendered most of the squatters homeless and destroyed belongings running into millions of cedis, we thank God that, unfortunately, there were no casualties.
However, the June 5, 2024, fire outbreak has come as a painful reminder of the June 3, 2015, fire that erupted at a petrol station some hundreds of metres away from the location of the present fire and killed some 150 people, whose 9th anniversary took place just two days earlier.
Any time there is a fire outbreak in the country, certain problems associated with previous ones are identified.
As we have already mentioned, the carelessness of the people is prominent, but our greater worry is that the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) encounters a number of problems, including difficulty getting fire hydrants in the immediate environs of the fire, and so the firefighters had to travel long distances for water to fight the fire.
It is clear that this contributed to the firefighters taking more than three hours (5:37 p.m.8:57 p.m.) to extinguish the fire.
We can conjecture that since some of the victims could salvage what was left of their belongings, many more of the belongings could have been saved if it had taken a shorter period to kill the fire.
The government should consider providing more fire hydrants, particularly in places where fire outbreaks are rampant.
In addition, the GNFS should be provided with all the facilities that would make it easier for its personnel to get access to every fire and extinguish it, including turntable ladders, all types of fire hoses, firefighting foam equipment, and dry risers.
Also, the district assemblies should ensure that access to communities and markets is not blocked or usurped.
Besides, the Electricity Company of Ghana should make its workers go around town to check for illegal connections and overloaded sockets and extension boards.
While we talk about these things, there is a need to bring to attention the warning the Greater Accra Regional Minister, Mr. Daniel Nii Kwartei Titus-Glover, gave the victims of the Wednesday fire when he said the place was not meant for habitation and that anybody who constructed any structure to be used as settlement there would be arrested by law enforcement agencies.
Much as we do not begrudge him for his warning, we think his office, the regional administration, and the relevant district authorities should first be blamed for looking unconcerned when squatters begin erecting structures for use as homes.
If they are cautioned or stopped initially, they can probably find somewhere else to go and live.
It is time to address the general issue of squatters settlements in the country, but in the present case, the government must come in and help the fire victims, some of whom might have lost some money in the fire in addition to personal belongings.
Probably, the government would have to build some moderate facilities to accommodate these squatters, some of whom contribute to nation-building in one way or another.",,Editorial,  7 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Address-issue-of-squatters-settlements-1934654
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Emancipation Day urges improvement of lives,"Yesterday, the Ghana Tourism Authority (GTA) launched the 2024 Emancipation Day celebrations scheduled for July 22 to August 1, 2024, which is the actual Emancipation Day.
Even though Emancipation Day has been celebrated elsewhere, like in the US, for over one and a half centuries, the GTA put the celebration on its calendar of events in 1998.
This is a day marked to commemorate the resistance of African people in the Diaspora against enslavement and the violation of their human rights, which eventually earned them liberation.
That is to say that the day is a reminder of how important it is to allow everyone on the surface of the earth, no matter his or her age and socio-economic status, to live with dignity.
Dignity can be defined as being able to independently shape ones life, including the future, to draw on ones own experience and capabilities, and to live as a respected member of ones social group and society as a whole.
Emancipation Day has become an annual and national event in Ghana, and it appears the focus is on what it commemorates rather than what it connotes.
What the day connotesliving in dignityis a kind of connection between the African forebears who laid down their lives for the freedom of the enslaved Africans and the present generations of Africans everywhere.
This is what should be the idea at the centre of the marking of the day as we organise the various events.
We should remember, for instance, that it took the efforts of former slaves, most of whom had been prevented from even learning to read, to establish schools in the southern part of the US and become educated.
What was more was that freed peoples universal demand for education invariably served as the catalyst for bringing public schooling to the South, and the schools were not only for African-American children but also other children, regardless of race, gender, class, or previous condition of servitude.
Every year, Emancipation Day attracts beautiful themes and speeches, but the aftermath events show that the spirit of resilience to create societies that value living in dignity is missing in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa.
African politicians and their cronies continue to plunder the wealth of their respective countries.
Public officials whose reputations are already a strain on the public purse go further to misappropriate public funds that could have been used to improve the lot of their people and make them feel proud as citizens.
Can the Ghanaian masses and others elsewhere in Africa join those in Switzerland to say they are among the people who live in a state of material well-being and relative safety, secure in the knowledge that the lions share of their basic needs is well covered? The biting poverty, squalor, and lack in every area of life are so pronounced that no ordinary African, particularly a Ghanaian, can sincerely make that claim.
As the country waits to celebrate Emancipation Day from July 22 to August 1, it should dawn on all its leaderspolitical, traditional, religious, and the likethat the day has a lesson that makes it imperative that they have a duty to improve lives rather than always seeking only their interests.",,Editorial,  5 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Emancipation-Day-urges-improvement-of-lives-1934318
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Make law work in all electoral processes!!,"On Thursday, May 30, 2024, the
Electoral Commission
(EC) began the transfer of votes, the application for proxy voting, and the replacement of lost or damaged voter ID cards.
The exercise is scheduled to end on Friday, June 14, 2024, but it could be extended because of certain happenings around it.
For instance, just days after it started, it recorded violent incidents at some registration centres, usually clashes between agents of the two dominant parties in the country: the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) and the ruling
New Patriotic Party
(NPP).
In the circumstances, an emergency Inter-party Advisory Committee (IPAC) meeting between the
Electoral Commission
and the political parties was called yesterday but ended inconclusively.
A careful read of our lead story gives the impression that the meeting ended that way because of the different positions taken by the NDC and the NPP on the matter.
The NDC thinks that should not be the case because the whole idea of the EC is intended to advance the electoral fortunes of the NPP.
Meanwhile, the NPP says that under the law, there is no room for party agents to observe the transfer of votes and application for proxy voting but the voter registration and that it was in the interest of transparency that the IPAC decided that party agents should serve the process, but if circumstances have called for a U-turn, then all stakeholders must abide and allow the process to proceed seamlessly.
It is a fact that democracy cannot eliminate political parties, but it appears members of political parties in the country are always in for their own interests.
The majority of the people have lost trust in politicians because they see how, through corruption, the politicians have made politics more lucrative than industry, such that politicians become richer than business people overnight.
There is suppressed anger among the people, and the only way to stop it from exploding is to change the status and allow the law in every aspect of public life in Ghana to work.
What does the law say about the transfer of votes and the application for proxy voting?
What does the law say about the EC and IPAC?
We remember no one but a former chairman of the EC, Dr. Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, telling the media and, for that matter, the entire world in September 2021 that IPAC decisions cannot be binding on the EC as that would mean meddling with the independence of the Commission.
While we say this to sort of appeal to the NDC to reconsider its stance on the agent matter in the ongoing exercise, we do not rule out whatever fears they have.
We can only say that no party should foment trouble that can put the result of the 2024 presidential election in particular in disrepute and cause violence.
The EC must do well to erase any such suspicions and make the law work in all the electoral processes in the country.
This years election is going to be the most crucial so far because while the ruling NPP is sure of breaking the eight-year cycle of political power that has characterized the countrys Fourth Republic despite the performance of the ruling party, the NDC, accusing the NPP of unprecedented dismal performance for almost eight years, wishes to frustrate that enterprise and take power.",,Editorial,  4 June 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Make-law-work-in-all-electoral-processes-1934156
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: ECOWAS needs strong, widespread digitalisation infrastructure!!","Digitalization has become indispensable in the world today; hence, it is not surprising that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Resident Representative in Ghana, Baba Gana Wakil, is urging member states to consider digitalization in the socio-political and security landscapes.
For clarity in this editorial, we would take the socio-political landscape to be a combination of social and political issues that relate to the political and social lives of the people.
Examples are matters relating to human rights, economic equality, production, immigration, the spread of development projects, ecology, the environment, democracy, the rule of law, and mass media.
Security can be included here, but separating it from the other socio-political factors may require particular attention, which is important.
In a world today full of crimes, issues of security call for particular attention, especially when criminals always attempt to be ahead of the security services.
Digitalization helps in crime prevention using such opportunities as DNA matching, automatic surveillance using artificial intelligence (AI), and face recognition, and improved digital exchange and analysis of global crime data.
What is critical is that ECOWAS countries should have the infrastructure that would help their people enjoy the benefits of being secured from all manner of crimes.
There should come a time when ECOWAS countries will have digital currencies for all the related benefits.
It is on record that Nordic or Scandinavian countries like Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden have efficiently digitised their financial infrastructure so that very few people carry cash.
Such a situation can have huge benefits for ECOWAS countries, where there is more money in the hands of the people than at the banks, resulting in criminal attacks for cash in which criminals even kill in order to take the money from individuals and other sources.
An effective digital currency system can reduce or even eliminate such attacks, and in addition, it can check money laundering, large-scale corruption like kickbacks from companies, tax evasion, and black market activities.
The police can also have effective tracking systems to trace criminals like mobile money scammers.
Digital identities and signatures can also help prevent forgery and corruption.
It is being said that one day all manufactured items used by society will be made smart and connected to the internet and can be programmed to be used by particular people so that intruders like thieves can be traced to the location of the item.
This means digitalization will render stealing a fruitless venture.
With regard to the areas of sociopolitics, digitalization has started impacting life in the ECOWAS space, except that it is not as widespread as elsewhere and also not at the same level among the member states.
But at least, digitalization is evident to some extent in the states, as, for example, all of them use smartphones, adopt digital technologies to do business, hold meetings virtually, and hold political campaigns.
Some state institutions, like the courts, are also automated.
The matter now is that ECOWAS members need a strong and widespread digitalization infrastructure for them to enjoy its full benefits.
And while they think about the benefits of digitalization, they should not fail to consider its flip side, which includes cybercrime and loss of jobs and how to fix them.",,Editorial, 30 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-ECOWAS-needs-strong-widespread-digitalisation-infrastructure-1933399
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Let vision 2057 break cycle of national dev. plan non-fulfilment,"Yesterday, the countrys National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) launched a long-term national development framework, Vision 2057, whose collective objective is to elevate the country to upper middle-income status by 2057.
The contents are generally lofty, and what we can describe as its features and objectives are superb.
For instance, it has been crafted to guide the creation of medium-term development plans every four years, ensuring continuity and alignment with long-term aspirations.
It is explained that the sub-plans would inform annual action plans and the national budget, reflecting the needs of all Ghanaians.
Even advanced countries need national development plans to better the lives of their people, and for a developing country like Ghana, this is very critical.
Therefore, Vision 2057 should be seen as a redeemer if it is implemented in a sustainable and consistent manner because it has taken sustainable development to bring Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea, for instance, to the heights they have attained.
This is not the first time the country has adopted a national development plan.
We remember, for instance, short- to medium-term development plans such as the 7-Year Development Plan for National Reconstruction and Development (19631969), the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (20012003), and the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (20042007).
All these and other previous plans were not sustainably and consistently implemented, and so their objectives were not achieved.
Also, we can make reference to the recent Long-term Development Plan of Ghana (20182027), which was a 40-year plan for the country.
What are the reasons for changing or dropping development plans for others?
The first, arguably, relates to different ideals of successive political leadership; otherwise, why the need to replace the 40-year plan whose end date is the same as Vision 2057?
Probably, the various successful political administrations would plead that the national development plans did not align with their manifestoes, hence the urge to abandon them so they could follow their campaign promises.
This situation has not helped the countrys forward march.
No wonder the country is still grappling with problems relating to industrialization, spatial planning, population growth management, infrastructural expansion, and environmental degradation in all its forms and shapes.
When we said early on in this piece that Vision 2057 should be a redeemer, all we had in mind was that it should be a turning point in the development journey of the country.
In that regard, we share the view of the NDPC that continuity should be the buzzword and that future governments should align their projects with Vision 2057 goals, and there should be collaboration among all Ghanaians by contributing ideas and talents to shape the nations future.
However, the question of Vision 2057 also failing cannot be ruled out unless all the hindrances to the success of development plans are identified and vehemently fought.
For instance, since it will take every Ghanaian for the plan to succeed, the culture of impunity in every area of the country must be checked.
Is it not sad that impunity, among other things, has undermined the spatial planning of the country and, as well, made environmental degradation unbearable?
National development planning must no longer be a partisan matter but an issue that should meet the needs of the present generation and be the springboard for future generations to carve their own progress.",,Editorial, 29 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-vision-2057-break-cycle-of-national-dev-plan-non-fulfilment-1933189
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Adopt measures to de-dollarise Ghanaian economy,"Since New York became the financial capital of the world and the dollar officially became the worlds reserve currency in 1944 as a result of the Bretton Woods Agreement, the world has been trading in the dollar.
For some countries like Ghana, which import more than they export, this situation has affected their currencies so much that they always need a certain amount of dollars to stabilise their economies.
In Ghana today, the demand for the dollar is so high that the rate at which it is exchanged for the cedi has become unprecedented in the countrys financial history.
Currently, certain sources say the cedi exchanges for above GH14.00 to a dollar, but the reality is that it is heading towards GHc16.00 once other sources talk of the rate being above GH15.00.
In the circumstances, it appears long-term solutions are not the best options now; hence, the country would have to adopt short-term or ad hoc measures for some time.
Therefore, we cannot help but say that it is good news to hear from the
Bank of Ghana
(BoG) that it has enough dollars to meet the foreign exchange needs of the country.
We have no intentions to contest this, but our worry borders on why, in spite of the amount of money available, the rate of its exchange to the cedi keeps hitting the skies.
It is clear that the BoG is aware of the causes of the problems, one of which it has mentioned as speculation, and has urged those engaged in speculative purchases of dollars to stop the practice, and that the BoG remains fully committed to providing stability in the exchange rate of the cedi.
Are speculation and stabilising the economy related?
If it is so, then the BoG must do something serious and urgent about the speculation.
We want to take solace in the central banks caution that it has enough foreign exchange reserves to support the market and that economic agents should stop engaging in speculative purchases or they will suffer economic losses when the measures being adopted take effect.
Maybe because we are not experts, we have difficulty appreciating statements and measures because we only focus on what is happeningthe realities that members of the public talk about.
The assurance from the BoG that it has adequate reserves to manage the shocks in the foreign exchange market because of its improved reserve position and whatever strength it has is good, but we expect that the measures to bring down the pressure on the cedi will take effect.
Prices of goods and services keep rising because traders and service providers in the country make reference to the value of the dollar rising against the cedi as what affects their prices and charges.
The popular appeal now is that the BoG and, for that matter, the government should strengthen the steps adopted to have the strongest effect on bringing relief to the masses.
Definitely, the country should not remain in the dollarization web forever, and as a long-term measure, Ghana must pursue what would help it join the de-dollarization movement now sweeping across the globe, spearheaded by countries like China, India, Brazil, Malaysia, and Bolivia.",,Editorial, 28 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Adopt-measures-to-de-dollarise-Ghanaian-economy-1933028
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check African leaders to serve people!!,"Last Saturday was African Union Day (AU Day).
In 2002, the AU was born to replace the Organization of African Unity (OAU), formed on May 25, 1963, by African states, but the May 25 date was not changed.
Thus, every year, May 25 is celebrated across Africa as AU Day.
As usual, the day is celebrated by events, some even preceding it.
Therefore, on Friday, Ghana held a flag-raising ceremony in Accra before Saturday to commemorate the 61st African Union (AU) Day.
Then on Saturday, the African Group of Ambassadors and High Commissioners observed AU Day in Accra to showcase Africas diversity in unity.
Such events are important as they keep reminding Africans, particularly African leaders, of the objectives of the AU.
In fact, it can be argued that the strongest defence for re-placing the OAU was that it was formed at a time when some African countries were still under colonial rule and so had among its objectives the efforts to rid the continent of colonisation and apartheid.
However, OAUs other main objectives could not be discounted as they are relevant now as they were at the time of setting out the OAU Charter, the guide to the organisations activities.
Today, it is still relevant to promote the unity and solidarity of African states; coordinate and intensify their cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for their peoples; safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States; promote international cooperation within the United Nations framework; and harmonise members political, diplomatic, economic, educational, cultural, health, welfare, scientific, technological, and defence policies.
That is to say that the AU is continuing with the major work of the OAU in spite of some changes.
The changes include replacing the Commission of Mediation, Conciliation, and Arbitration with the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, and Resolution in 1993, and the AU Constitutive Act and protocols establishing a significant number of new structures, both at the level of major organs and through a range of new technical and subsidiary committees.
In fact, the AU was established as a body that could accelerate the process of integration in Africa, support the empowerment of African states in the global economy, and address the multifaceted social, economic, and political problems facing the continent.
Since we cannot decouple the OAU's work from that of the AU, there are questions to be asked and comments to be made.
Can the AU account that it has made significant inroads into its objectives 61 years after African countries agreed to cooperate in certain areas as a united continent and one people?
Some of us think the AU has a lot more to do in all aspects of life on the continent.
The truth is that its objectives can be achieved with good leadership, but it is common knowledge that current African leaders have failed their people as they seek their own interests rather than those of their people.
Today, in Africa, politics pays more than industry, making even young talents want to do politics rather than honing their talents for their best benefit.
The AU must, therefore, position itself well to check African leaders to work towards its objectives as expected in each African country to make the benefits or importance of the union tangible to all Africans.",,Editorial, 27 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-African-leaders-to-serve-people-1932853
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Fight obstetric fistula with all steam!!,"The call by the First Lady, Mrs. Rebecca Akufo-Addo, for concerted efforts to tackle the problem of obstetric fistula in Ghana to improve the lives of mothers and reproductive health is a pregnant one.
It is pregnant because it concerns the treatment and prevention of the condition, as well as public education about it, including the need to avoid stigmatising patients.
Generally speaking, a fistula is an abnormal connection that joins either two body cavities, like the anus and the female reproduction organ, or one of them to the skin.
A fistula is said to occur when the tissue wall or a barrier between two body parts has broken down, usually due to trauma, injury, or infection.
While the World Health Organization (WHO) says an obstetric fistula is a hole in the birth canal caused by obstructed labour, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) states that it is a hole between the birth canal and bladder or the rectum caused by prolonged, obstructed labour without access to timely, high-quality medical treatment.
The UNFPA information says it leaves women and girls leaking urine, faeces, or both and often leads to chronic medical problems, depression, social isolation, and deepening poverty.
Other sources say it leads to urinary incontinence, pain, tenderness, or itching in the affected area, pus or foul-smelling discharge, fever, and nausea or vomiting.
It is sad to learn that fistulas mostly occur among women living in poverty, in cultures where a womans status and self-esteem may depend almost entirely on her marriage and ability to bear children.
Looking at the fact that the regions in which obstetric fistula mostly occurs include sub-Saharan Africa, where Ghana is located, and the devastation of the condition, the First Ladys call must be given special importance.
The role of women, particularly mothers, in the family and the larger society should call for urgency for everything that affects them in a disenabling manner, particularly bad health and poverty.
Even though the condition is said to not usually heal on its own, proper medical care, such as surgery and wound care, can help treat it.
This means the country must have the relevant medical facilities and well-trained professionals to manage the condition once it occurs.
The government must take this point seriously because the WHO states that obstetric fistula still exists because healthcare systems (particularly in poor countries) fail to provide accessible, quality maternal health care, including family planning, skilled care at birth, basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care, and affordable treatment.
Fortunately, the condition is preventable.
A holistic approach to preventing it is being advocated, and this includes engaging with traditional authorities to understand the causes emanating from some cultural practices like putting underage girls in the family.
Besides, all women should seek medical care regarding fistulas.
Then, the larger society must be educated about the condition.
We believe the country must have all the motivation to fight fistula.
After all, preventing and managing obstetric fistulas will contribute to improved maternal health and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7, which seeks universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including family planning, information, and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.
Also, that will enhance the countrys image in healthcare globally.",,Editorial, 24 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Fight-obstetric-fistula-with-all-steam-1932496
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Deliver GARID project timely,"It is heartwarming to hear that
Parliament
has approved US$150 million from the World Bank as additional financing for the implementation of solid waste management, drainage improvements, and other flood mitigation measures under the Greater Accra Resilient and Integrated Development (GARID) Project.
It is equally good news that the World Bank is also supporting a broad range of initiatives to mitigate floods and improve solid waste management in the Odaw River Basin.
The project areas captured under the GARID and Odaw Basin initiatives are essential, as they are intended to solve very worrying problems.
Effective solid waste management, good drainage, and other flood-mitigating measures appear to have eluded the country for decades.
Solid waste problems obviously stem from a lack of toilets in homes and public places, which makes some people do open defecation with its attendant health and other problems.
Even where there are good toilets, there are problems regarding where human excreta should be dumped and treated.
Elsewhere, human excreta is used to produce energy, such as domestic gas.
In the case of Ghana, the country appears overwhelmed by the amount of its human waste.
Such waste does not mean only human excreta but also rubbish generated on a daily basis.
Thus, the construction of a waste transfer station and an engineered landfill site must be prioritised.
Definitely, the government cannot shirk its responsibility regarding waste management, and so all stakeholders must give the necessary support for the waste management initiative to succeed.
Now regarding flooding in Accra, we hail the intention to undertake such projects as the repair works on sections of the Odaw Basin, the construction of storm drains in Kaneshie and Nima-Paloma, and the creation of water detention ponds.
The establishment of a flood warning system in the Greater Accra Region is a must.
This is because the region has most of its communities being flood-prone.
But that is not to say other regions of the country are free from flooding.
We, therefore, hope whatever is being done in Greater Accra to mitigate flooding and its devastation will be replicated in the regions to save other citizens.
Everything the government is doing to check flooding is good, but why are flood projects usually done in the rainy season?
We think that must change because they mostly fail to be completed to achieve their objectives.
Besides, some aspects of them are destroyed by the very flood that is targeted to be controlled.
In the end, revaluation is done, and the costs of the projects increase, which is an extra burden on the national budget.
It is the hope of every Ghanaian that the GARID project and related ones will be timely delivered so their objectives will be fully achieved to the benefit of the people.",,Editorial, 23 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Deliver-GARID-project-timely-1932309
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Oil revenue decline must not affect Ghanas development,"The 2023 Annual Report of the Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) on the use and management of oil revenues launched in Accra yesterday states that Ghanas share of petroleum revenues for 2023 declined by 25.65 percent due to a decrease in oil production for the fourth conservative year and lower global prices.
The country earned $1.06 billion in 2023; $1.42 billion in 2022, which is the highest so far since the country started commercial oil production in 2010; $783.33 million in 2021; $666.39 million in 2020; US$938 million in 2019; and US$813.95 million in 2018.
Compared to the initial revenuesUS $444 million in 2011; US$541 million in 2012; and US$846 million in 2013one could see some consistency in growth but along the line, some inconsistency set in.
For instance, even the 2013 figure of US$846 million beat those of subsequent years of 2018 (US$ 813.95 million), 2020 (US$666.39 million), and 2021 ($783.33 million).
We definitely know that certain factors accounted for this, as is the case for 2023.
The 2023 decline in oil revenue is due to a decrease in oil production and lower global prices.
Are these the only problems causing the decline in the countrys oil revenues?
What about the quantities of barrels that the country receives as its share of total production?
In his article titled Is Ghana Getting Its Fair Share of Oil Revenues after 10 Years of Production and Exports? published May 24, 2021, Theo Acheampong, one of those who follow the countrys oil production figures, states that Ghana has produced 453.89 million barrels of crude oil from three fields (namely, Jubilee, TEN, and SGN) since 2010.
This was 11 years after the country had struck oil, and out of that figure, a total of 452.09 million barrels (that is, 99.71 percent) had been lifted or sold by all the partners.
What is of interest is that of the 452.09 million barrels lifted, Ghanas share was 78.85 million barrelsthis is 17.44 percentmeaning that the country got less than 18 percent of the value of US$31.62 billion generated from all the lifting for 11 years.
We agree that all this happened due to the agreement(s) reached with the countrys partners in its oil extraction.
That is to say, once production figures go down or up, the country will get its corresponding share.
But the question is, should the agreement stay as it is for the country to receive a paltry share?
We would not be surprised if the relevant public officials came out to defend the agreement as the best so far.
We have not forgotten the hullabaloo about the agreement on the lithium found in the Central Region and how such an agreement was defended as one of the best in the world.
In the face of declining oil revenues, our major concern is the need for the country to explore other viable sources of revenue to support its development.
When the country struck oil in 2010, many Ghanaians had the hope that the fortunes of the country and its people were going to change for the better, but those hopes have become a far cry.
There is therefore a need for the countrys managers to do all they can to restore hope to the people, even if oil revenues fail to pick up.",,Editorial, 22 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Oil-revenue-decline-must-not-affect-Ghana-s-development-1932115
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Fix clinical trials challenges in Africa!,"May 20 every year marks International Clinical Trials Day, which commemorates the day Scottish medical scientist James Lind began the first randomised clinical trial in 1747.
Therefore, yesterday was International Clinical Trials Day.
History has it that while aboard the HMS Salisbury, a 50-gun fourth-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy of Great Britain, Dr. Lind conducted what is considered the first clinical trial by administering different dietary supplements prepared from oranges and lemons to sailors suffering from scurvy.
His findings, highlighting the effectiveness of citrus fruits in preventing scurvy, laid the foundation for modern clinical research.
Clinical trials are research studies that test a medical, surgical, or behavioural intervention in people and are the primary way by which researchers determine if a new form of treatment or prevention, such as a new drug, diet, or medical device, is safe and effective.
Often, a clinical trial is designed to learn if a new treatment is more effective or has fewer harmful side effects than existing treatments.
Other objectives include finding approaches to preventing a health problem by testing people who are healthy but at increased risk of developing a disease.
This shows how important such research is.
James Lind deserves every honour for his ground-breaking pioneering work, which has undergone unimaginable evolution to enhance healthcare.
In a world now bedeviled with countless diseases, some of which defy treatment, clinical trials cannot be ignored in healthcare.
Fortunately, today, clinical trials are highly structured and rigorously regulated to ensure the safety and efficacy of new treatments.
Besides, it is on record that advances in technology, ethical standards, and global collaboration have significantly enhanced the capacity to conduct clinical research, bringing innovative therapies to patients worldwide.
Unfortunately, however, the records show that despite these advancements, conducting clinical trials in Africa poses some particular challenges.
Africas population is said to be equivalent to 17.8 percent of the total world population of 7.951 billion as of 2022 and bears 25 percent of the global burden of disease, yet only about four percent of global clinical trials are conducted on the African continent.
And the sad aspect of it all is that the four percent trials are unevenly distributed and concentrated in only a few countries.
The sadder part is that, as a result, most medicines are developed through clinical trials conducted outside Africa without considering the implications of their use with African patients or within African health systems.
Key obstacles accounting for this state of affairs are said to include limited funding, inadequate infrastructure, and regulatory complexities.
Why does Africa lag behind everything that happens on the globe, however good it is?
Do African leaders care about the wellbeing and welfare of their people?
If African leaders want to toy with things in their countries, those things must not include the health of the people.
Is it not dangerous to allow African countries to use medicines developed from clinical trials done outside the African continent?
It is about time African governments fixed the problems by seriously partnering with the Science for Africa (SFA) Foundation, which seeks to increase investments in clinical research, enhance regulatory frameworks, and foster collaboration between stakeholders.
What is more, the SFA Foundations Clinical Research and Trials Community (CRTC) programme is committed to transforming the clinical trials landscape in Africa through several strategic initiatives, including increasing investments in ethical clinical trials and creating a sustainable clinical trials ecosystem in Africa.",,Editorial, 21 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Fix-clinical-trials-challenges-in-Africa-1931951
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Adopt pragmatic measures, not directives, to stop price hikes!!","Prices of goods and services keep skyrocketing, and the situation appears out of hand in that price changes occur at any time.
There is a story of a market survey done by the Ghanaian Times published today, and it should not surprise anyone if the figures quoted by the paper go wrong this morning.
Various factors influence changes in the prices of goods and services, and all these more or less depend on the economic conditions of the country.
Such conditions may include mismanagement by the government, in which wrong decisions that undermine normal life can be taken.
This is to say that the government cannot escape blame for the current state of economic affairs in the country if a real on-the-ground analysis is done.
In the Ghanaian Times market survey story, Dr. Nyaaba Charles, an agriculture expert and Chief Executive Officer of Akuafo Nketewa Company, the Business Unit of the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana, says the government has removed subsidies on farm imports such as tractors, agricultural machinery, spare parts, and fertiliser.
Naturally, this situation is an instance that would cause an increase in the production of food.
Importers would pay more for those items, and they would transfer the price difference to the farmers who buy from them, and they in turn would transfer the change in prices to consumers.
If what Dr. Nyaaba is saying is actually what she obtains, then the question is, what informed this decision?
Did the government officials who took that decision analyse the ramifications?
It is true that other factors like the profit motive of businesses and individual traders can influence price hikes, but it is believed that the government can and has to do something by way of subsidy, removal of certain taxes, engagements with the business community, and fulfillment of agreements reached at such engagements.
At the moment, it appears things are not as expected, and so the members of the business community have taken a position that can keep them in operation.
Quite recently, transport operators insisted they were going to increase fares regardless of the pleading from officialdom to them to shelve that decision.
What happened in the end?
We are also aware that just last week, the Minister for Trade and Industry, K. T. Hammond, directed the Cement Manufacturing Development Committee to instruct manufacturing companies to immediately reverse the recent increases in cement prices.
The Minister further requested the publication of the retail prices of cement by all manufacturers to help stop the continuous, arbitrary increases in cement prices.
The public is yet to see what would become of this directive if the prices of the inputs for the production of cement kept rising.
The Ghanaian Times thinks that the directives from the government to businesses in the country would remain charade because of the dollarization of the Ghanaian economy.
If businesspeople and industries have to import most of their inputs for production and the dollar keeps appreciating against the cedi and nothing economically prudent is done except blaming COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukraine war, the business community would continue to defy directives that would bring their operations to a grind.
In the end, consumers are the victims, as their incomes remain static, but they must make ends meet.
The government must intervene with pragmatic actions, not directives that infuriate the business community.",,Editorial, 20 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Adopt-pragmatic-measures-not-directives-to-stop-price-hikes-1931761
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Help educate public on climate change,"Media practitioners everywhere must be aware of problems in their societies and be advocates, educating the public on these problems and also demanding actions for solutions from the relevant quarters.
Since media practitioners are also humans and, as such, suffer from some human frailties, they sometimes have to be prompted to or reminded about what is happening in society and the need for them to act as it is required of them.
Sometimes they have to be called upon to pay particular attention to some specific problems because of their serious effects on society.
Media practitioners must not deem such calls as moves to denigrate them, but ones meant to emphasise how society values the role they can play in its forward march.
Thus, it is not out of place for Akosua Frema Osei-Opare, Chief of Staff, Office of the President of the country, to call on media practitioners in Africa to prioritise advocacy on climate change and other environmental crises to support efforts to mitigate their impacts.
The Ghanaian Times believes this call is paramount because, generally in Africa, those who are supposed to take the necessary actions to address certain problems most of the time neglect their roles because, whether they perform or not, no one will hold them accountable.
In the face of the lack-of-accountability situation, it would take only the media to expose those neglecting the duties for which they are paid by the taxpayer.
Sometimes, it is not as if duty bearers have shirked their responsibilities, but they have challenges they cannot just wake up to talk about for various reasons, and so media promptings create opportunities for them to ease their frustrations.
On such occasions, the media can demand action from the relevant institutions or ministries.
It is also important for the media to inform and educate the public about occurrences that affect their very existence and progress.
Relating these to climate change and other environmental crises to support efforts to mitigate their impacts, we can say that the media must continuously study environmental crises in terms of their causes, effects, and how they can be addressed.
They can then get to know who does what, who should do what, and, if need be, what media practitioners themselves can do to help stem the crises or mitigate their effects.
This is a daunting task because in Africa, due to the diverse perspectives in different societies on even the same problems everywhere, the African media practitioner has to diagnose the particular situation and report on it for effect.
Frema Osei-Opare is, therefore, right to point out that the media should take up the responsibility of informing Africans about the adverse effects of human activities on the environment and the need to protect it.
She is equally right when she says media education is critical in influencing public opinion on environmental issues, as it can positively impact the larger society in combating climate change and other environmental crises.
Elsewhere, society is well informed about climate change and its effects on society, and there are also measures adopted by governments to address the situation.
In Africa, it will only take the media to push for that state of affairs, as the people find it difficult to demand such accountability.",,Editorial, 17 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Help-educate-public-on-climate-change-1931353
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: VAT exemption on healthcare items boost to quality medical care,"The government taxes citizens and businesses to raise revenue to meet their budgetary demands, such as financing public projects.
In Ghana, where the government usually experiences budget deficits and all budgeted inflows fail to come in as expected, it is not easy to grant tax exemptions on a source that is already being complied with.
This is why it becomes a bit curious to learn that the Ministry of Finance will now grant a value-added tax (VAT) exemption on raw materials for local manufacturing of drugs, finished pharmaceutical products, and medical supplies.
But this should not be so surprising because the tax system is not only used to raise revenue but also to make the countrys business environment conducive to the growth of businesses.
In this particular case, everyone hopes that the tax exemption will take immediate effect and boost the healthcare sector in terms of job creation and a reduction in the cost of accessing healthcare.
When health concerns grow, the tax exemption can take care of itself by bringing in returns of multiple values.
However, this is not the foremost reason for the move taken by the Ministry of Finance.
The Ghanaian Times takes particular note of the foremost reason that the move has become urgent due to the dwindling donor inflow to the health sector.
This means that if the donor inflows had continued as expected, the government would have left the players in the pharmaceutical and medical supply sectors of the healthcare industry to grapple with their problems.
As things have turned out now, the Ghanaian Times believes members of the public would like to know what caused the donor inflow to dwindle.
It is an issue that lack of accountability from the Ministry, for instance, can make it difficult for donors to be accountable through compliance with their own governments regulatory requirements and donor reporting.
And this can kill the fire of their philanthropy. Was it the case that some of the donors were suffering risks that affected their reputation and operations?
Could it be a case of implicit bias in which the donors, due to some attitudes relating to a lack of understanding of certain actions and decisions, thought it wise not to bring in their inflows contrary to the countrys expectations?
Maybe the donors lack the financial muscle to continue with their giving to the country.
What exactly was the matter?
While the answer(s) tarry, the Ghanaian Times thinks the annual health summit organised by the
Ministry of Health
is an important event because it helps to take stock of the performance of the countrys healthcare sector.
This years theme, ""Quality Healthcare Delivery: A Catalyst for Achieving Universal Health Coverage in Ghana,"" is significant as it is timeless.
Quality healthcare delivery is sine qua non (essential) at all times, and this idea must prompt the countrys healthcare professionals to continuously update their knowledge in order to avoid mistakes like giving wrong prescriptions or making patients undergo wrong procedures.
Such errors could be fatal or have long-term, devastating effects. There is also a need for the government to provide the necessary facilities and incentives for healthcare workers to properly safeguard the health of the people, who constitute the greatest asset of the country.
It is also important for the public to take healthcare instructions seriously.",,Editorial, 16 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-VAT-exemption-on-healthcare-items-boost-to-quality-medical-care-1931171
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Save public promises, fix Kaneshie-Kasoa highway!!","Even when there is moderate rainfall affecting the areas bordering the Kaneshie-Mallam Junction-Kasoa highway, traffic congestion builds on this road in unfavourable proportions, but Mondays downpour caused unprecedented gridlock that stretched over 20 kilometres and left thousands of commuters stranded for hours on the road.
The downpour flooded key sections of the Mallam-Kasoa stretch of the Accra-Cape Coast highway, making traffic standstill from Kaneshie.
Those who could not tolerate long waits on vehicles had to make their journeys home hours on foot.
For instance, a commuter had to walk for four hours and 20 minutes (7:00 p.m.11:20 p.m.), covering a distance of about 15 kilometres, from his office at Kwame Nkrumah Circle to his home at New Aplaku Last Stop.
It is public knowledge that the Kaneshie-Mallam Junction-Kasoa highway has peculiar problems that must be fixed.
For instance, it is well known that the Atala area gets flooded at the slightest rainfall, and the stretch from the toll booth (Tuba Junction) to the Broadcasting Junction suffers mudslides, with both situations impeding the free flow of traffic.
There are recorded instances of members of the public calling on the government to fix the highway.
For instance, we can recall an October 2023 demonstration by hundreds of residents of the Ga South Municipality in which they marched on the Mallam-Kasoa highway to protest the traffic situation commuters endure on daily basis, which is compounded when it rains.
The event had the hashtag Fix Kasoa Highway.
Besides, we remember another demonstration one month later in November in which the residents of Kasoa issued a two-week ultimatum to the government to construct a drainage system around the tollbooth and its surrounding areas to facilitate the smooth flow of water during rainfall.
Coming from the same group of Fix Kasoa Highway protesters, the ultimatum was necessitated by the refusal of the government to respond to the earlier demonstration and also for the omission of the Kasoa Highway from the list of roads the government intended to work on, which had been captured by the 2024 Budget and Economic Policy.
Anytime issues about the fixing of roads and any other public infrastructure crop up, public officials are quick to respond that they have plans in place to fix them.
Therefore, it is not surprising that following questions raised about the Monday downpour and the ensuing unprecedented gridlock on the Kaneshie-Mallam-Kasoa highway, the Municipal Engineer of the Weija-Gbawe Municipal Assembly, Dr. Daniel Sowah, has said the matter had been discussed with the Greater Accra Regional Minister-designate, who has called for further discussions on a holistic solution to the problem at hand.
Such assurances have become trite because they have been given many times without being fulfilled.
If Dr. Sowah wants the public to believe him and, for that matter, the government, then the Kasoa highway, which is part of the ECOWAS highway, must be fixed promptly, as seeing is believing.
Ad hoc measures used to fix the road are not the best, and the current poor state of the countrys stretch of the ECOWAS Highway is a blot on the countrys image.",,Editorial, 15 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Save-public-promises-fix-Kaneshie-Kasoa-highway-1931008
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Have a second look at US$25.3 billion NTE target,"The Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA) is praising the countrys performance in non-traditional exports (NTEs) and related earnings.
NTEs refer to products that are new or exotic to Ghana (that is, products not traditionally produced in Ghana) and products that have been traditionally produced for local consumption but are now being exported to foreign markets.
The NTE sector in the country is categorised into three main divisions, namely agriculture, processed/semi-processed, and industrial art & craft sub-sectors.
Thus, cashew nuts, fish, and handicrafts, for example, are exported from the country to the international market.
It is on record that Ghana has become an attractive destination for investments in the West African sub-region because of its democracy and political stability for over 30 years now.
This is good news and one to enhance the countrys forward march, as some state institutions that care about this state of affairs are leveraging the situation for the benefit of the country.
For instance, the GEPA has adopted the National Export Strategy to develop the potential of the NTE sector to make the maximum contribution to GDP growth and national development, consolidate and enhance Ghanas middle-income status, and create job opportunities.
Contribution to GDP growth clearly relates to earnings from NTEs, and currently, the country has set a target of US$25.3 billion by 2029 and is doing all it can to achieve it.
Even though the Ghanaian Times does not intend to fault any state institutions that are stakeholders in this move, the paper thinks that unless something unexpected is done, that target would be far from its achievement.
This position is based on the reality on the ground, considering some earnings figures over some years.
Yesterday, the GEPA announced an 11.75 percent increase in 2023 NTE earnings, totaling US$3,944,146,717.
Even though the 2022 figure was not given, if it is assumed that 11.75 percent is over that figure, then the 2022 figure is US$3.529 billion.
For 2021, NTEs yielded US$3.330 billion, whereas the 2020 earnings amounted to US$2.846 billion, reflecting a decline in the 2019 figure of US$2.899 billion.
As things stand now, the 2023 figure of US$3,944,146,717 is the highest so far.
If we look at the percentage increases in recent years (20192023), which even come as higher figures, we can say the average increase over these years is about US$288 million.
Even if this average figure is rounded off to US$300 million and quadrupled in each year from 2024 to 2029, the mathematics is US$1.2 billion annually for six years, which amounts to US$7.2 billion.
When this figure is added to the US$3.944 billion earned in 2023, the total will be US$11.144, using the hypothetical scenario created here.
In the face of this, the Ghanaian Times thinks the US$25.3 billion NTE earning target by 2029 is highly unrealistic and so must be reviewed.
However, the GEPA is encouraged to put more fire into all its plans towards improving the NTE sector to rake in more earnings for the country.",,Editorial, 14 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Have-a-second-look-at-US-25-3-billion-NTE-target-1930793
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Kumasi airport redevelopment economic prudence,"The upgrade of the Kumasi airport into an international facility and its renaissance as Prempeh I International Airport have messages to engage the attention of the public.
Even though five countries in the world, namely Monaco, San Marino, Andorra, Lichtenstein, and the Vatican, do not have airports because of a lack of space, those that do have them should have more for various reasons.
Thus, for example, the United States has 13,513 airports, of which 102 are international, Russia has over 2000, with 67 international, and Indonesia has 673, with 23 of them being international.
Generally, both domestic and international airports facilitate the swift movement of goods, connecting businesses with suppliers and customers.
They are also said to enable perishable products and time-sensitive cargo to reach distant markets quickly.
In particular, international airports facilitate swift movement across countries and continents, thereby supporting global supply chains and boosting the export potential of countries.
Though international airports have domestic facilities attached to them, they are usually larger than the domestic ones as they feature longer runways and other facilities to accommodate heavier aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 commonly used for international and domestic travel.
This was the same idea behind the upgrade of the Kumasi airport when, in June 2018, President Akufo-Addo cut the sod for the commencement of phase two of the project.
Now the facility has a 2,300-metre runway to accommodate Boeing 737-800 series aircraft.
We think that the Kumasi Airport, now named Prempeh I International Airport, would make international travel easier for people from the Ashanti, Ahafo, Bono and Bono East, Northern, Savanna, Upper East, and Upper West regions.
It will save them money, time, and all the hassles involved in coming to Accra to catch flights abroad or land first in Accra on their return from their travels.
For those going to Kumasi, for instance, things will be the easiest.
The new international airport will certainly boost the Ashanti regional economy, which the country can leverage for its progress.
Some businesses can open branches in Kumasi and nearby communities, and new ones can crop up.
The cost of land close to the airport will appreciate.
We can also say beautiful edifices would spring up around.
We, therefore, appeal to the government to speed up the process to tackle phase 3 of the redevelopment of the airport for more benefits to be derived from it.
Above all, we hope the airport will be maintained regularly and upgraded when the need arises.
Now regarding the renaming of the airport, Prempeh I, we think President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
has said it all (see story on page 8), and so we will not belittle the point.
However, there is a lesson we want every leader, elected or traditional, to note.
Otumfuo Osei Tutu II
is said to have played a pivotal role in the redevelopment of the Kumasi airport, yet he did not fight for it to be named after him.
The Otumfuo has demonstrated real selflessness, which our leaders need; he has given honour to whom it is due.
We commend him for this and recommend this spirit to politicians, even if the honour is due to their opponents.",,Editorial, 13 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Kumasi-airport-redevelopment-economic-prudence-1930621
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Account for GH3 million missing at KMA!!,"The Ghanaian Times commends the members of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly (KMA) for raising serious concerns over some GH3 million missing at the assembly and urging a thorough investigation into the matter for those culpable to be held accountable.
At the 9th General Meeting of the KMA on Wednesday, the assembly members learned that a GH5 million loan the Assembly proposed to be secured in the 2021/22 financial year for the Krofrom market redevelopment was increased to GH8 million.
However, only GH4.8 million out of the amount had been spent on the market project, with no record of the disbursement of the GH3 million.
We know cases of this nature are commonplace in district assemblies across the country but are being covered.
Meanwhile, some assembly members, particularly those on the Finance and Administration (F&A) Committee, have neglected their core duty of demanding financial accountability on behalf of their constituents.
The district assemblies were established as an attempt to decentralise the government and to assist in development at the local level.
This means there is the devolution of power to the district level, popularly termed as decentralisation, which puts the development of the districts in the hands of local administrators, including assembly members.
This makes it imperative for assembly members to take a keen interest in every development project in their electoral areas.
But, of course, the Ghanaian Times knows that it sometimes becomes difficult for some Assembly members to get information on projects in their jurisdictions.
This totally defeats the spirit behind decentralisation.
This paper therefore urges assembly members to seek information about every local project, at least from their Presiding Member (PM), who can contact the District Chief Executive if he does not have the required information.
In the face of what is happening at the KMA, such a move is critical because it can lead to stopping some corrupt practices bedeviling state projects or exposing underhand dealings already executed.
If the information this paper has gathered is not an exaggeration or falsehood, then the increase in the proposed loan amount of GH5 million to GH8 million is intriguing and must be explained.
That explanation must be given by those who contracted the loan from the head office of Fidelity Bank in Accra, all because their positions put that responsibility on their shoulders.
Why has Fidelity Bank been declining to clarify the matter regarding the increase in the loan amount from GH5 million to GH8 million despite repeated attempts to get that information?
Well, knowing the sensitive nature of certain issues in banking, the Ghanaian Times would not blame the bank.
However, the paper thinks the bank could have told those seeking the information that, per banking rules, they did not qualify for such information, so they cannot today cite the banks refusal to provide the information in a way that is open to various interpretations.
Will Fidelity Bank take it lightly if some people say it is supporting underhand dealings?
Whatever the case is, the Ghanaian Times commends members of the KMA for helping to grow the demand for accountability from state duty bearers.
This is exemplary and must be emulated by all district assembly members in the country, as well as other citizens.
Every Ghanaian has the responsibility to fight corruption.",,Editorial, 10 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Account-for-GH-3-million-missing-at-KMA-1930221
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Mercury elimination crucial to Ghana,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has urged small-scale miners to stop applying methods that involve the use of mercury and adopt modern techniques to protect human lives and preserve the environment.
The impression has already been clearly given in the call that mercury hurts both humans and the environment, and that makes the call highly imperative.
It is recorded that the artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sector is the largest user of mercury globally, emitting 727 metric tons of mercury annually, which accounts for about 35 percent of global air emissions, and releasing about 800 metric tons of mercury into water bodies.
Coming home to Ghana, it is well known that ASGM activities are known for the use of mercury for the amalgamation of gold.
In the case of illegal gold mining, otherwise known as galamsey, research by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found that almost all of the mercury used in galamsey is released into land and water bodies.
The findings of this country-specific research include the fact that mercury poisoning due to illegal mining has affected the soil and the quality of drinking water in communities close to river bodies like the Birim, Enu, Pra, Bonsa, and Ankobra, as they have been badly polluted.
Making the call to stop the use of mercury, the EPA emphasized that the chemical in ASGM causes in the affected communities permanent brain damage, seizures, vision and hearing impairments, stillbirth, deformity among babies, delayed childhood development (stunted growth), and kidney malfunction.
Already, there is the use of mercury-added products in the country, such as manometers, batteries, linear and compact fluorescent lamps, skin-lightening soaps and creams, cement, pesticides, biocides, topical antiseptics, dental amalgam, and thermometers.
There is now an ongoing global mercury phase-out, and so the UN is urging member countries to considerably reduce mercury use or eliminate it.
In fact, in some jurisdictions, such as Zimbabwe, mercury use is illegal, and in others, it is restricted in certain ways.
There is now the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a global agreement for reducing mercury pollution.
It recognizes the risks of using mercury in ASGM and calls upon nations to reduce and, where feasible, eliminate it.
The Minamata Convention was agreed upon by more than 120 countries in October 2013 to increase global efforts to significantly reduce and subsequently eliminate mercury releases into the atmosphere, land, and water bodies.
It takes its steam from a mercenary poisoning incident in Japan in 1956, in which more than 2,000 people died; the incident later became known as the Minamata Disease.
Fortunately, there are now alternative ways of undertaking artisanal small-scale gold mining, collectively called mercury-free concentration methods, which the EPA calls tenable.
These are methods used to increase the amount of gold in ore or sediment by selectively removing lighter particles to eliminate or greatly reduce the need for mercury.
They include chemical leaching, panning, sluicing, and spiral concentrators, centrifuges, magnets, flotation, vortex concentrators, and shaking tables.
These techniques are obviously safer for miners, their families, and local communities, and they are helping artisanal and small-scale miners elsewhere achieve high rates of gold recovery.
As the EPA makes the crucial call, the Ghanaian Times expects that the government will kindle the fire of the galamsey fight and also enforce every piece of legislation and convention addressing the elimination of mercury in the relevant sectors of the countrys economy.",,Editorial,  9 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Mercury-elimination-crucial-to-Ghana-1930015
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Patronise voter registration no matter what!,"We believe the
Electoral Commission
(EC) has publicised enough of its limited voter registration exercise scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 2024, to Monday, May 27, 2024, ahead of the December 2024 presidential and parliamentary elections.
However, we wish to encourage eligible citizens to patronise the exercise to become registered voters who can exercise their franchise in any national election in the country henceforth.
The 21-day exercise is targeted at individuals who turned 18 after the last voter registration and those over 18 who have not yet registered as voters.
It is unfortunate that the exercise took off yesterday amid some incidents.
The most unfortunate one had to do with the technical or system issues with the ECs registration machines, which caused varied periods of delay in the commencement of the exercise at various centres.
Obviously, these problems were unexpected, so the EC must be proactive enough to prevent recurrence or be alert and fast enough to resolve them should they occur again.
Our fear is that, considering their frustrations, some of the yet-to-be-registered voters can call it quits, and the EC would fail to achieve its target of registering 623,000 eligible voters.
This may mean that some eligible voters would have been directly or indirectly disenfranchised, all because the technical problems with the ECs machines frustrated their efforts to register and they developed apathy for the exercise.
We, however, trust in the ECs repeated commitment to ensuring a successful exercise and thus join it in calling for restraints and cooperation from the prospective voters.
Technical problems can occur even when they are least expected.
The incidents involving political party agents at some registration centres also take some shine from the exercise meant to enhance citizens participation in the countrys electoral system.
If the reports reaching our news desk are anything to go by, then we call for the strongest condemnation of the attempt by representatives or agents of the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) to get a non-Ghanaian registered at the University of Mines and Technology, Tarkwa (UMaT) centre in Tarkwa-Nsuaem Constituency in the Western Region.
If the police had delayed intervening in the matter, the tussle between the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) and the NDC could have resulted in violent clashes likely to mar the smooth running of the exercise.",,Editorial,  8 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Patronise-voter-registration-no-matter-what-1929848
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Qualification for 33rd Olympiad wake-up call,"We congratulate Ghanas 4x100m mens relay team on booking their ticket to this summers Olympic Games in Paris after winning Heat 2 on Day 2 of the World Relays held in the Bahamas.
It is heartwarming to learn that the quartet, made up of Ibrahim Fuseini, Isaac Botsio, Benjamin Azamati, and Joseph Paul Amoah, crossed the finishing line in a time of 38.29s, which is their season-best, to book automatic qualification for the 33rd Olympiad.
A big thumbs-up to the quartet for demonstrating resilience and good team chemistry, according to reports.
In spite of all the values of sports, it cannot be dismissed that sports competitions engender rivalry that causes team members to want to always win against their opponents.
If they fail to do so, the fire of rivalry makes them want to avenge their loss at their next meeting.
In the context of this rivalry, we are happy that the victory of Team Ghana was made sweet for sticking to their resolve to fend off any challenge, however stiff, from perennial rivals, Nigeria, to whom they lost their African Games gold at the recent Accra Games.
To a large extent, the rivalry in sports hardly ends in hatred among athletes, and it is moving that Nigeria demonstrated this by joining Ghana to celebrate their qualification with an expression of bountiful joy.
That show of love is the spirit needed in all spheres of life and among all nations in a world full of troubles and uncertainties.
Now regarding the subject of sports, the mention of Ghana readily brings to mind football, as well as boxing, because these are areas where the nation has gained fame.
However, names like Alice Anum ignite memories of the countrys honours in races.
The achievements of Ibrahim Fuseini, Isaac Botsio, Benjamin Azamati, and Joseph Paul Amoah should, therefore, be a wake-up call to the Ministry of Youth and Sports and agencies like the National Sports Authority to consider the gains all sports disciplines can bring to the country and see how to hone talents in those areas.
It is obvious the country pumps most of its resources earmarked for sports into football, and even in the area of football, male football is the focus, to the neglect of female football to a very large extent.
This must change, especially when players of the senior national team, the Black Stars, have begun showing that they have lost the steam of patriotism that can cause them to put up their best performance to make the country proud.
Today, most Ghanaian football enthusiasts love to support European teams because they derive joy and pleasure from their play spirit, which they lack in their compatriots, especially those who play for teams abroad.
The way out now is for the country to provide the appropriate facilities to hone talents in all disciplines, and such training should emphasise patriotism.
Besides, corruption in sports, particularly football, should be strictly checked in order for the country to present real talents at continental and global competitions.",,Editorial,  7 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Qualification-for-33rd-Olympiad-wake-up-call-1929688
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Help sustain the environment!,"On Friday, the world celebrated World Press Freedom Day, and as usual, countries that respect free speech and democracy organised events to commemorate the day, which falls on May 3 every year.
At such events, speeches reflecting the theme of the occasion are made.
It is worthy of note that the global theme for 2024 is A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the Face of the Environmental Crisis, out of which the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA) has carved out the local one as Leveraging Journalism for Sustainable Environment and Future.
The role of the media in modern life is very critical because every society has to be well-informed in order to move with time.
A well-informed society is able to understand issues of life, determine their roles as to their contributions to the ills, and decide what to do to advance the progress of society.
For instance, as the fourth estate of the realm, the media has a role to play in governance and, for that matter, democracy.
As the world marks WPFD, we congratulate all journalists around the world, but we extend special congratulations to Ghanaian journalists.
We commend the GJA for acknowledging the fact that environmental sustainability is key to Ghanas progress and coaching a local theme that speaks to the huge environmental problems in Ghana.
We know the world faces a triple environmental crisis, comprising pollution, climate change, and the loss of biodiversity.
The speech of the President of the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), Mr. Albert Kwabena Dwumfour, captures some environmental worries in the country and so has to be commended.
We join in his call on the media to resume the concerted campaign against illegal mining.
We think, looking at the destruction of galamsey, that call has become so urgent, especially as it appears the fight against that environmental ill has considerably waned.
But galamsey is not the only problem.
Deforestation is equally serious, as it is rapidly contributing to the loss of biodiversity in the country.
There is a need to deal with all causes of biodiversity loss, including unbridled estate development.
There is a need for the government to adopt better housing policies to see an expansion of settlements.
Regarding pollution, we can say it is happening everywhere in the country, unchecked.
Emissions of carbon dioxide, indiscriminate dumping of refuse, and the like are rife.
The recently introduced emission tax appears to have good intentions, but that is not enough.
The government must take a serious view of environmental sanitation and surely check it, like in the olden days when sanitary inspectors could even visit homes and check cleanliness.
When it comes to climate change, it is said that third-world countries, including Ghana, are contributing less, yet we think that less is significant, especially when third-world countries appear not to have enough plans to check some of the causes, like bush burning for farming.
We pray that all stakeholders in environmental sustainability in Ghana will collectively do all they can to, at least, reduce environmental problems in the country.
Let Ghanaian journalists raise environmental issues and educate the public about them.
We also expect the government and its relevant agencies to up their game and sustain the environment for present and future generations.
Once again, congratulations to journalists on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day.
We commend them for their contributions to national development.",,Editorial,  6 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Help-sustain-the-environment-1929488
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Tons of commendations for Appiatses rebirth,"It will be recalled that on January 20, 2022, an explosion occurred at Appiatse, a farming community near Bogoso in the Prestea Huni-Valley Municipality in the Western Region.
The disaster occurred about 300km (180 miles) west of Accra when a motorcycle went under a truck carrying rock-shattering explosives en route to a gold mine at Bogoso.
At least 17 people were confirmed dead, including children and over 60 were injured.
Over 3,300 people were affected in one way or another, and reports from the National Disaster Management Organization indicated that 500 buildings had been destroyed and approximately 1,500 people had been made homeless.
The explosion, which also blew off roads in the area, was a national disaster.
At the end of it all, the whole community of Appiatse was declared to have been wiped off.
As the situation was, it was apparent that the people needed to be consoled and helped, and while some individuals and organisations showered them with relief items, the government promised to rebuild the community.
To prove its resolve to fulfill its promise, the government inaugurated a seven-member multi-sectoral reconstruction committee for Appiatse, the Appiatse Reconstruction Committee, chaired by Mr. Benito Owusu-Bio, a Deputy Minister of Lands and Forestry.
It was tasked with building a green and environmentally sustainable communitya good example of a model town that could be replicated elsewhere in the country.
Since the rebuilding would obviously demand money, the Appiatse Support Fund Committee, headed by Dr. Joyce Aryee, a former CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Mines, was also inaugurated to provide details on how Ghanaians and foreigners could contribute to the Fund for the benefit of the people of Appiatse.
Yesterday, the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, inaugurated 120 housing units for the explosion victims, which he described as the first of three phases of the governments relief efforts.
The Ghanaian Times commends the government for speedily fulfilling, at least, a crucial part of its promise.
The paper equally applauds the Appiatse Reconstruction and Apiatse Support Fund committees.
The members of these committees and their collaborators must have their work etched in the history of the countrys development.
The paper is especially elated that even before the ceremony yesterday, the Appiatse Support Fund Committee had caused the list of its donors to be published in the media space.
The list comprises 79 donors, including politicians, corporate entities, religious organisations, and individuals.
These donors also deserve tons of commendation.
The Ghanaian Times recalls that when it learned that Dr. Aryee was chairing the Appiatse Support Fund Committee, it expressed the hope she would once again uphold honesty and transparency and Appiatse would truly be reborn.
As the whole nation jubilates at the rebirth of Appiatse, we support the remarks by Dr. Bawumia that the ceremony to inaugurate the reconstructed Appiatse was, among other things, to celebrate resilience, compassion, and the indomitable spirit of the people of Appiatse.
We would like to add that even though the disaster they suffered was unpleasant, it has, in the end, brought them something to jubilate about, and they should let this assuage their pains and allow time to heal them.
The people of Appiatse should also note that their once-upon-a-time obscured community is now a global attraction, and so they should keep it green and clean to remain a good example of the model town that it was planned to be.",,Editorial,  3 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Tons-of-commendations-for-Appiatse-s-rebirth-1929106
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Can workers really impact Ghanas electoral, governance systems?","In Accra and the countrys other cities yesterday, workers parades were organized to show Ghanas participation in May Day celebrations across the globe.
Congratulations to all Ghanaian workers in both the public and private sectors!
The importance of organised labour in every economy must be hailed because it takes labour to build a countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the annual total of the monetary or market value of all the goods and services produced in a country.
The GDP, which can also be measured on a quarterly basis, functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given countrys economic health.
It makes it clear that the workers output is the basis of every countrys development.
It, therefore, makes economic sense that workers are treated well by the government for them to put in their best performance to help build the nation.
If this happens, then the government can demand accountability from workers.
Every year, the government has something to say to workers, either as a reminder of what it has done for them or what it expects from them.
For instance, at the national May Day parade held in Bolgatanga last year, President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
spoke about the achievements of his administration as far as workers were concerned.
He mentioned, for instance, that years 30 percent increment over the 2022 base pay for public sector workers.
Then, he gave the assurance that his government would protect incomes and pensions in challenging times and mentioned the resolve of his administration to fix the challenges to bring some relief to Ghanaians.
It is up to the workers themselves to state if they are fulfilling that promise.
At yesterdays workers parade in Accra, President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
called on organised labour to work toward ensuring that the countrys record as a beacon of democracy and peace is protected before, during, and after the December general election.
He said, Ghanas track record as a bastion of democracy and peace is an enviable one that needs protection.
His call comes in view of the local theme for this years celebration, Election 2024: the Role of Workers and Social Partners in Securing Peaceful Elections for National Development.
The President notes that workers form the backbone of the country and that they have special roles to play in shaping the outcome of elections, adding that your voices matter and your participation in the electoral process is essential to ensuring that the concerns and aspirations of working people are adequately represented in our governance structure.
We think the President has spoken well, and we wish workers voices, for instance, would make an impact in the electoral process and governance space, yet we wonder how effective that could be, considering how certain unseen hands pull strings here and there in those areas.
Besides, there are institutions, particularly the

Probably organised labour can raise issues and even go on demonstrations over certain electoral and governance concerns, but can they achieve their targets, especially if things go against the government?",,Editorial,  2 May 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Can-workers-really-impact-Ghana-s-electoral-governance-systems-1928913
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: NCCE should educate voters on democratic culture,"The advice to voters in the Ejisu Constituency in the Ashanti Region to cast their votes in todays by-election based on their needs for real long-term development in the area is of great essence to the growth of democracy in the country.
Therefore, this important advice from the chairperson of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), Ms. Kathleen Addy, needs to be embraced by all Ghanaians.
However, certain states of national affairs, dubious acts of politicians and political parties in the country, and the tacit push or support of some state institutions make it very difficult for voters in every part of the country to embrace the advice, even if they are willing to do so.
Regarding certain state of national affairs, we can say that the low level of education attained by some of the voters, their lack of understanding of the democratic culture and goings-on in the governance space, the hardships they suffer, their lack of knowledge of their rights and freedoms, and their lack of knowledge of what good things democracy should do for the majority of the people all combine to make the people politically vulnerable for exploitation by politicians.
On top of these and others like them is the situation where the law most of the time punishes the powerless and defends the politicians.
Some dubious acts of politicians and political parties are vote-buying and other inducements to woo voters.
Others include speeches that are meant to threaten or coerce the electorate to vote for certain candidates in exchange for development.
For example, comments that the people of Ejisu would only enjoy development when they vote for the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) candidate in todays by-election, otherwise it would elude them, are not tenable.
Democracy should allow voters to make choices rather than get forced to vote for a candidate or a political party against their will.
Politicians and their political parties should accept that every election, general or by-election, is a litmus test for them, so they should always do what is expected of them.
That way, they would not have to struggle so much to get voters to vote for them because the records would speak for them.
Recent comments made in the electioneering in Ejisu and elsewhere clearly point to the fact that the countrys politicians are in for skewed development.
It is sad that those who are bold enough to speak about such bias against their own party members at the helm of affairs are classified as traitors and people not fit to be associated with them.
One sad phenomenon that has come to bedevil politics in Ghana has to do with party communicators.
Instead of these people promising the good things their parties can do for the country and the edge their party has over the others, they mostly drift into vilifying their opponents.
What is most pathetic is that some state institutions that should help nurture the masses into mature democratic beings compromise their roles.
We can go on and on to raise other issues that our space cannot contain.
We know the NCCE is aware of many bad things undermining the smooth or unfettered growth of the countrys democracy, hence the advice that voters should vote based on their needs for real long-term development in their communities.
Voters should refuse inducements and threats and stop being the conduit for the politicians to take advantage to cling to power to shortchange the generality of the people.
Why should the electorate, the kingmakers, allow the politicians to have the power to misbehave and come to deceive them for more power only at the time of elections?
While the NCCE has not been economical about its advice, the Ghanaian Times wishes to remind its officials that they have the biggest role in nurturing the Ghanaian voter in a democratic culture, and this is the time to rise to the occasion and prove the mettle of the Commission.",,Editorial, 30 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-NCCE-should-educate-voters-on-democratic-culture-1928589
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Lets try male-female presidency,"As we have said in recent times, Ghana will make an unprecedented electoral history this year.
If the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) is able to Break the 8,"" that victory would be breaking the jinx about the two-term, eight-year rule enjoyed by the two dominant parties that have altered in ruling the country for almost 32 years in the countrys fourth republicthe
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) and the NPP.
Today, there is a group called the Alliance for Revolutionary Change (ARC), which has expressed the intention of fielding an independent presidential candidate, and if this candidate wins the presidency, that will be another interesting story.
However, for now, once we are yet to know the sex of the person the presidential candidate of the NPP, Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia will choose, we think the most serenading story will be having a female Vice President.
We, therefore, applaud former President John Dramani Mahama for sticking with Professor
Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang
as his running mate in the 2024 general election.
On Wednesday, the NDC officially unveiled Prof. Opoku-Agyemang, whom Mr. Mahama describes as a woman of unparalleled integrity whose credentials are unmatched and whose passion for Ghanas development is unwavering.
We stand to be corrected, but as a seasoned academic professor who has now chosen to be a politician, Prof. Opoku-Agyemang, so far, has not been involved in any scandal that taints her integrity.
Thus, we are inclined to accept all the good things said about her at her unveiling because they were coming from people who can attest to those virtues of hers.
One significant message we have gleaned from some products of the University of Cape Coast is that she respects everyone and did all she could to encourage her students to understand her lessons and also do personal studies so they could eventually come out as truly educated people.
Her political opponents may attempt to vilify her, but those who know her, we can guess, would dismiss whatever the opponents say as thrash and a figment of their own imagination, such as what one political minion and mischief-maker recently sought to do.
Professor
Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang
is not being touted as a superwoman; we will equally promote her if Bawumias running mate happens to be a woman.
All we are saying is that we can try a woman as Vice President of the country and see if she will not be the driver's mate but can exert some influence to bring about certain changes in the lives of the people.
The NDC lost the chance to provide that opportunity in 2020 with the same Prof. Opoku-Agyemang.
This was after other noble women had lost it.
Think, for example, about Brigitte Dzogbenuku with Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom in 2016 on the ticket of the Progressive Peoples Party; Mrs. Eva Naa Merley Lokko with Nduom in 2012; Cherita Nana Akosua Frimpomaa-Sarpong with Dr. Abu Sakara Foster (CPP, 2012); Adeline Dedo Nartey with Dr. Edward Nasigrie Mahama (Peoples National Convention, 1996); and Professor Naa Afarley Sackeyfio with Kwabena Darko (National Independence Party, 1992).
We think it is about time the people of this country gave women the opportunity to serve even at the countrys presidency, and it is time to start with the office of the Vice President because of their moderating traits.
The male-male card or combination has, so far, not done the country any better.",,Editorial, 26 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-s-try-male-female-presidency-1928040
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check schools that violate GES policies,"On Monday, the Ghanaian Times published a story about the dismissal of a 14-year-old Junior High School (JHS) student of Southlane Lake View School, a private institution at Kasoa-Hideout in the Ga South Municipality of the Greater Accra Region, for being pregnant.
Here was a girl who had initially been denied registration for the upcoming Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) but registered following persistent persuasion, yet refused school attendance.
How was she going to learn without a teachers guidance to pass the BECE?
The Ghanaian Times commends the Girl Education Coordinator of the Ga South Municipality, Ms. Florence Antwi-Boasiako, for taking up the matter after this paper made her aware of the issue.
Today, the pregnant girl is back in school, much to the joy of all those who were worried about her situation, particularly her grandmother.
The Ghanaian Times considers a letter of apology addressed to the pregnant child, signed by the headmaster of the school, Bortei Shadrach Borketey, as an afterthought and preposterous in view of the earlier stance of the school that the pregnant girl could not be allowed to study in the same classroom as her mates for some reasons.
Such reasons are flimsy because the very move of dismissing her violates Ghana Education Service (GES) policy on such a matter.
According to the GES, girls who mistakenly get pregnant (such as in the case of the 14-year-old girl in question who is alleged to have been defiled by a 50-year-old man) are allowed to attend school, unless doctors have advised that they stay out of school due to medical reasons.
It appears the authorities of Southlane Lake View School either do not know the GES policies regulating certain matters in basic education cycles or decided to do their own thing, damning the consequences.
The latter reason cannot be dismissed, looking at the peremptory stance of the proprietress of the school, Kate Otchere, shown in her refusal to accept any pleadings, all because a friend of the pregnant girls grandmother had warned her against her decision to deny the girl the chance to continue her education, especially when the BECE was a few months away.
It is clear that the authorities of Southlane Lake View School are nativists, who believe that important elements of understanding the world are innate and do not necessarily need to be learned from experience.
Such a mentality can impute even young people, including basic school children, with the wisdom to know better in all situations.
It is good to hear that the girl and her family are happy now that the girl is back in school, but this paper thinks that is not enough.
The girls family and the Ga South Municipal Education Directorate should monitor how the poor girl is treated in the school.
Some peoples futures have been jeopardised because of the negative attitude of certain teachers and schools.
For instance, some students could not complete school because of unjustifiable treatments like dismissals and embarrassing slow learners instead of receiving regular teaching.
GES officials should be concerned with such matters once they come to their attention, and that is to say, the public must not ignore the ill-treatment of vulnerable schoolchildren but report them for the appropriate action to be taken.",,Editorial, 25 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-schools-that-violate-GES-policies-1927837
"Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Stop issuing threats, hasten process of fixing fares","Of late, there have been reports of the intentions of transport operators to increase fares, and the whole country is awaiting that.
However, reports reaching the Ghanaian Times have it that some commercial vehicle drivers in Accra (both trotro and taxi) have started charging new fares from the centre of the city to some of its suburbs.
Meanwhile, long-distance drivers are waiting for the process of increasing fares to end before introducing new fares.
The problem now is that the charging of the unapproved fares has resulted in confusion between the erring drivers and their mates on one side and passengers on the other.
While the drivers insist on doing everything possible to collect the new fares, whether approved or not, some passengers are refusing to pay the fares because they have not been made official by way of approval from the appropriate authorities in the transport sector.
Much as the Ghanaian Times is not against an increase in fares, it is worried about the annual chaos associated with the increase, both before and immediately after it.
That means the front-liners in the matter have failed to learn lessons from the happenings regarding an increase in fares over the years.
There is no way even the government can stop the increase in fares since it has not been able to stop the hikes in the prices of vehicles and the inputs used in operating them.
Therefore, the best thing to do is to start planning for the increase in fares long before any groups of drivers or drivers unions start any move that can be counted against them.
Let everyone be honest and say that the delay in addressing issues that directly affect ordinary citizens, such as fixing transport fares, is unacceptable.
Besides, the show of power and authority in such matters must be discarded because it is provocative.
The Ghanaian Times thinks, for instance, that the Ministry of Transport should rather help to hasten the negotiation to increase fares than en-treating the
Ghana Police Service
and other security agencies to be on the lookout for the arrest of any driver who flouts a directive to drivers not to increase fares, jointly issued by the Ministry of Transport, Ghana Private Road Transport Union, and Ghana Road Transport Coordinating Council, which form the tripartite committee in the transport sector.
Statements like this tend to make those directed at them as well as others display some impunity or raise objections to taunt the power bearers, and this is exactly what is happening now.
The Concerned Drivers Association of Ghana (C-DAG) has called the bluff of the Ministry of Transport over its directive, insisting its members will charge their new fares because transport operators are not charity organizations.
The Chamber of Petroleum Consumers (COPEC) has also chided the Ministry over its directive, maintaining that the Ministry has no power to determine transport fares.
In addition, a former Department of Transport Minister, Joyce Bawah Mogtari, has challenged the Ministrys authority to order the arrest of private transport drivers for increasing their fares because it lacks the mandate to do so.
It is about time principal stakeholders in the transport sector, particularly the Ministry of Transport did the needful about fixing transport fares to forestall chaos involving drivers, their mates, and passengers rather than issuing threats.",,Editorial, 24 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Stop-issuing-threats-hasten-process-of-fixing-fares-1927654
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Let the 'Four Betters' improve our well-being,"In one of our last week's editions, we published an article written by QU Dongyu, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, titled Unlocking Africas potential through agrifood systems transformation and capacity building.
The article was a prelude to the 33rd Session of the FAO Regional Ministerial Conference for Africa that took place in Morocco between April 18 and 20, attended by all the ministers of Food and Agriculture from the African continent.
Mr. Dongyu postulated in his article that the FAO has outlined its strategic vision for the years ahead through the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-2031, which centres on the Four Betters: better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, agrifood systems comprise the entire range of actors and interlinked activities that add value to agricultural production, as well as related off-farm activities such as food storage, aggregation, and post-harvest handling, transportation, processing, distribution, marketing, disposal, and consumption.
Indeed, the FAO Regional Ministerial Conference for Africa provides one of the main continental platforms for African governments to share their perspectives and experiences on implementing agrifood system transformation and building capacity.
The conference comes on the back of more than one billion Africans who cannot afford a healthy diet, and this is simply unacceptable. By encouraging better nutrition, FAO is working with countries and other partners to make healthy diets affordable and accessible for all.
According to him, The Four Betters are not just a vision; they are a call to action. They are the pathways through which countries can transform agrifood systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more sustainable to deliver on the commitments of the Sustainable Development Goals and the post-Malabo agenda.
As against the background, the hike in food prices is throwing so many households into hunger and poverty. We cant agree more with the FAO's statement about the need to implement the necessary policies to ensure adequate food security on the continent to remove our people from the quagmire of hunger and poverty to more prosperous and dignified lives so that no one will be left behind.
In the words of Mr. Dongyu, by encouraging better production through such means as mechanisation, digitalization, agrifood industrialization, and green-powered irrigation, African nations can boost productivity and efficiency and enhance resilience to the climate crisis.
The FAO boss noted that often, Africa presents two faces to the world: one characterized by stereotypes of poverty and hunger, and the other an authentic reflection of this richly diverse and vibrant continent. By harnessing the power of science and technology, enabling policies, and responsible investment, African nations can unlock the true face of the continent: a land of abundance, resilience, dynamism, and opportunity.
He urged African governments to embrace this phase and work together on agrifood system transformation for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind.
Of course, Africa abounds with enormous opportunities to transform societies from the negative narratives of a continent plagued by hunger and poverty to a very prosperous and wealthy continent that their people are proud of.
We at the Ghanaian Times believe our Minister of Food and Agriculture or his representative is back home with fresh ideas to speed up the concept of the Better Fours for the well-being of Ghanaians.",,Editorial, 22 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Let-the-Four-Betters-improve-our-well-being-1927224
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: We wish Muslims Barka da Sallah,"Over the last one-month period, Muslims across the world went through a spiritual exercise of fasting in the Holy Month of Ramadan, abstaining from food and drink from dawn until sunset to attain the blessings and mercies of Allah.
Fasting is one of the pillars of Islam, and Ramadan is a time for purifying the soul, refocusing attention on God, and practicing self-discipline and sacrifice.
During the month of Ramadan, Muslims aim to grow spiritually and build closer relationships with Allah by engaging in increased prayer, recitation of the Quran, and acts of charity.
Yesterday, they crowned the month-long fasting with the Eid-ul-Fitr, observed with open prayers to give thanks and praises to Allah for successfully seeing them through this enduring spiritual exercise characterised by sleepless nights of supplications, all in fulfillment of an important pillar of Islam, to seek Allahs blessings and mercies.
The purpose of fasting extends beyond self-restraint from physical needs; it is a time for spiritual rejuvenation and enhancing ones relationship with Allah.
Before going out to observe the open prayers, we are told Muslims offer the Zakat-al-Fitr, a specific charity given at Ramadans end, to ensure that even the less fortunate can partake in the celebrations of Eid-ul-Fitr.
We at the Ghanaian Times want to associate with the Muslim community on this joyous occasion to say Eid Mubarak (Blessed Eid).
We are happy that the youth did not overindulge and get involved in acts that will take the shine out of the celebration.
We believe the celebration embodies the spirit and purpose of Ramadan, highlighting the importance of coming together to honor the values of compassion, gratitude, and mutual respect that are central to the faith.
We are told that Ramadan is not a one-off spiritual exercise to demonstrate an unwavering commitment to the cause of the religion, but the experiences of Ramadan seek to offer lessons and inspirations that Muslims are encouraged to integrate into their daily lives beyond the month of Ramadan.
Muslims are, thus, expected to reflect on the core purpose of Ramadan: to cultivate a lasting spiritual discipline that transcends the month itself, enriching the lives of believers with continuous reflection and devotion.
The elevated devotion and connection to Allah experienced during Ramadan set a spiritual benchmark for personal growth and piety.
This holy month should inspire Muslims to continue the practices of daily prayers, Quran reading, and reflection, aiming to maintain the spiritual momentum of Ramadan.
By carrying forward the spirit of Ramadan throughout the year, Muslims can embody the change we wish to see, fostering environments of understanding and care that transcend cultural, religious, and geographical boundaries.
We are of the firm conviction that Ramadan is an inspiration to Muslims towards a journey of personal growth and collective betterment, making the values of this sacred time a living part of their daily lives.
In doing so, they would have honoured the essence of Ramadan and contributed to a legacy of peace, unity, and compassion that will resonate for generations to come.
We pray for Gods guidance for the Muslim faithful, who form the core of our readership, to continue to uphold the Islamic virtues and be steadfast in their religion.
We entreat them to pray to God to shower His blessing on the country for continuous peace, tolerance, religious coexistence, and prosperity.",,Editorial, 12 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-We-wish-Muslims-Barka-da-Sallah-1925771
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Resolve Global Fund donation impasse to avert health calamity,"On page 9 of our yesterday issue is a story in which the Coalition of CSO Networks in HIV, Tuberculosis (TB), and Malaria is calling on President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
to assist in the clearing of locked-up Global Fund-donated health care items at Tema Port, valued at over US$40 million.
These items said to include antiretroviral (ARV), TB medications, and malaria treatments, have been locked up since May 2023.
The Global Fund invests more than US$5 billion a year to fight HIV, TB, and malaria and has been a crucial supporter of Ghanas health initiatives, contributing over US$1.2 billion since 2002.
It is said that despite the Funds consistent aid, the government is demanding exorbitant taxes and port charges for clearing the donated commodities, contrary to the Framework Agreement exempting such charges.
What is more worrying is that efforts by a 12-member Global Fund delegation in March 2024 failed to resolve the impasse, leading to the suspension of all future commodity shipments until the current issue is resolved.
What has been the arrangement since 2002, when the Fund started supporting the country?
Now that this issue has come up, it will do the government good if it makes its relevant representatives explain matters to the public.
This is important and must be done at the earliest; otherwise, those who lack understanding of such matters would conclude that the government is just being callous, particularly because the Coalition says the lock-up has caused a shortage of drugs for treating HIV, TB, and malaria, as a result of which patients are suffering needless deaths.
How much are the duties and port charges accruing from the donations from the Global Fund, a non-profit organisation that cannot be waived when the government can grant tax holidays and other waivers to commercial entities?
The United States (US), described as the Global Funds largest donor, says its support for the Global Fund is a strategic investment in the millions of people whose lives have been saved through Global Fund-supported programmes.
Ghana should think about health first and adopt the US attitude so that even losing revenue for the sake of its citizens would not matter at all.
Meanwhile, it is not strange for Ghana to grant tax exemptions to the Global Fund.
It is on record that a tax waiver was granted to AngloGold Ashanti on December 22, 2010, for its malaria services, and subsequently, the Global Fund Board secured exceptional approval of extensions of the programme until the end of 2015.
Why can such an exemption not be granted to the Coalition of CSO Networks this time around?
Even there is a general principle that for each programme, the purchase and/or import of any goods or services using the grant funds shall be exempt from relevant taxation applicable in the host country, including but not limited to customs duties, import duties, taxes, or fiscal charges of equal effect levied or otherwise imposed on the health products imported into the host country under the Grant Agreement.
Even where certain taxes are paid, refunds must be made to the Global Fund.
The government must think of the more than 250,000 individuals living with HIV who depend on Global Fund-sponsored ARVs, the expiration of some of the drugs, and the impending loss of Global Fund support and urgently do something to avert any looming health calamity.",,Editorial, 10 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Resolve-Global-Fund-donation-impasse-to-avert-health-calamity-1925455
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Support Justice Torkornoo to bring honour to Ghana,"On June 12, 2023, President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
, as mandated by the countrys 1992 Constitution, swore in Justice Gertrude Araba Esaaba Sackey Torkornoo, a Justice of the Supreme Court, as the Chief Justice (CJ).
After taking office as the 15th CJ of the country and the third female CJ after Justice Georgina Theodora Wood (20072017) and Justice Sophia A. B. Akuffo (201720202020), Justice Torkornoo said she would do well to rebrand the judicial system in Ghana to deliver robust and cost-effective services to increase public trust in the courts.
Yesterday in Accra, Justice Torkornoo launched an initiative dubbed Leading Justice: a strategic framework for increasing legality, ethics, assets, digitalisation and due process in justice delivery.
We once again congratulate Justice Torkornoo on her appointment and on being the first Chief Justice to launch such an initiative to enhance the quality of justice delivery nationwide.
Our story on page 9 gives a fair glimpse of what the CJ hopes to achieve.
Highlighting the use of technology, particularly digitalization, as part of her vision to bring justice to the people, Justice Torkornoo has clearly sent out the message that she is in tune with current happenings in her chosen career.
We are also aware of Justice Torkornoos vast experience, including being active in the core reform agenda and activities of the Judiciary and the Judicial Service of Ghana (JSG) since 2005; serving as a judicial leader in the development and oversight of a number of reform projects of the Judiciary involving the European Union, USAID, DFID, and collaborations with other African countries; and being involved in reforms in streamlining Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in commercial justice delivery in circuit and high courts that led to the passage of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Amendment Rules 2020 (CI 133) in the country.
And, of course, we do not discount the ability of Justice Torkornoo to acquire new knowledge and skills to enhance her performance.
We, therefore, join her in her appeal for the necessary assistance from the relevant institutions for her to deliver.
For instance, her request for increased budgetary allocations to the judiciary to expand infrastructure on the automation and digitalization agenda must constantly capture the attention of the Ministry of Finance.
Justice Torkornoo has made her vision clear, and this makes it easier for the sources of assistance to begin to think about what they can do to help her even before she officially or officially approaches them.
That goodwill will help Justice Torkornoo deliver as expected and possibly even beyond what she has envisaged.
The Ghanaian Times stands ready to trumpet the CJs feats once it gets to know about them.
Those of us working on the paper know that though Justice Torkornoo will be accorded some honour for her success as the Chief Justice, Ghana will be accorded the bigger honour in the community of nations if its judiciary is run well.
As we hail you, Justice Torkornoo, we wish to make this single appeal: Kindly do well to stamp out corruption from the justice delivery system and make all Ghanaians equal before the countrys laws.",,Editorial,  9 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Support-Justice-Torkornoo-to-bring-honour-to-Ghana-1925275
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Ghana can be best in governance in Africa,"The Ghanaian Times receives as good news the fact that Ghana has been ranked the best-performing country in governance in West Africa according to the recent World Economics Governance Index report.
It is similarly good news that the report by World Economics Research, based in London, also places the country fifth in its overall position in Africa.
First of all, the Ghanaian Times deems it an honour, as always, to praise the state of Ghana and her people for achievements that resulted from the efforts of the political establishment as an entity, relevant institutions, and the people as a whole.
It is a great joy to learn that after providing the indicators that helped the country achieve that feat, such as political stability, rule of law, accountability and government effectiveness, consistent efforts in upholding democratic values, ensuring transparency, and promoting inclusive policies, the report acknowledges the healthy participation of Ghanaians in democratic processes.
All Ghanaians should take pride in the fact that the report takes particular note of the interaction of the citizens with established institutions, laws, and the elected actors of governance within an atmosphere of tolerance.
Our cherished readers, particularly those who follow political goings-on in the country and across Africa, can give their own examples of fellow African countries whose politicians and political institutions have compromised democratic values such that election periods are times to be on tenterhooks. Is it not heartwarming to learn that the countrys ranking reaffirms its commitment to democratic principles and effective governance systems, reinforcing its status as a beacon of stability and progress in the West African sub-region?
It is good to hear that the governance evaluation considered factors like political rights, law and order, press freedom, and corruption to place the country in a respectable position in grade B with a score of 61.7.
This paper thinks the country could have done better if certain checks had been done.
There are certain happenings in the country that must be checked to improve its future scores because it is a fact that other rating institutions can rank it differently if they pay particular attention to the insolence and disregard some politicians exhibit towards journalists, for instance.
It is also the case that the citizens have issues with how law and order work in the country.
Any future rating should delve deep into whether justice is skewed in favour of some against others.
That can inform those in charge of the law and order to make amends for everyone in the country to believe in its justice system.
As a paper that desires news that says it as it is, the Ghanaian Times wishes not to dispute whatever research has been confirmed until proven otherwise by another research.
However, as a paper that observes significant happenings in the country, it wishes to state that the countrys proactive approach to combating corruption and promoting transparency is not working as expected.
The media space is awash with news of corrupt practices involving public officials, and the Auditor Generals annual reports are a good source of such information.
It is about time for the powers to fix the shortfalls in the countrys governance for it to be at the top of the rankings in Africa as a whole.",,Editorial,  8 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Ghana-can-be-best-in-governance-in-Africa-1925084
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Embrace measures to avoid budget overruns,"Budget overruns constitute one huge public financial management problem in Ghana.
In spite of budgets prepared for various state projects, the problem recurs and is worst in election years when politicians want to complete particular projects to attract votes.
Since overrun occurs when the actual cost of a project exceeds the estimated or budgeted cost, it means that the state is going to pay more than it should be.
However, the problem does not end there, as the overrun can cause further problems with the projects scope, schedule, quality, or risk management and affect the projects profitability, stakeholder satisfaction, and competitive advantage, according to studies.
For instance, a few months after their handover, roads hurriedly done in election years begin to develop defects like potholes.
At the end of it all, the unbudgeted funds pumped into the construction of such roads have gone to waste because, in no time, the need to reconstruct them arises.
These and other reasons are why we support the appeal from the Minister-designate for Finance, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam, to the Chief Directors and Heads of all Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) to ensure strict compliance with their stated budgets for this year, a general election year, in order to curtail overruns.
He was magnanimous enough to show the Chief Directors and the other heads how to implement the appeal, and this is very important.
He says it is imperative that they engage their political heads and not commit to projects that have not been budgeted for, no matter which quarter they are coming from.
Going by what the minister-designate is saying, we can conclude that the appeal is part of a government expenditure reform on the way.
This means that when finalised, the reforms are going to be embodied in public expenditure policy, which must be respected by even the President of the country.
All stakeholders working on such reforms and the subsequent policy must, therefore, attach urgency to the process and bring some restrictions to ensure prudent expenditure to save the Consolidated Fund from constant stress.
The Ghanaian Times commends the minister-designate for his concerns, but it seems this step is long overdue.
Public duty bearers, particularly politicians and heads of covered entities, have taken advantage of and exploited the situation for far too long, which has hurt the countrys financial strength.
We do not understand why the incoming minister should count on the Chief Directors and other heads to engage their respective political heads on the governments policy direction to ensure the effective implementation of the measures at their various entities.
We think the best thing to do is to call the political heads to a meeting and sensitise them to the ramifications of their budget overruns.
If really politicians are providing service to the people without any ulterior motive, as they claim, then here is one occasion to prove their selflessness.
In that case, we also think there is a need to sensitise the public and understand why certain projects must wait until the appropriate time.
And while this is being done, there is a need for the government to check for factors that typically cause budget overruns, such as delays in payment to contractors, project variations, inflation, and schedule slippage.",,Editorial,  5 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Embrace-measures-to-avoid-budget-overruns-1924710
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Prepare to heed forthcoming ban on noise-making,"The Ga Traditional Council (GTC) has announced that this years ban on drumming and noise-making within the state will commence on May 6 and run till June 6, a one-month period.
The Council specifies that the ban prohibits noise-making activities, including clapping of hands and the use of tambourines and other musical instruments during the period.
Thus, churches, mosques, and pubs, for instance, are expected to refrain from the use of musical instruments, placing loudspeakers outside their premises, and carrying out open-air activities.
Roadside evangelists are also expected to cease their activities during this period.
Other open-air activities banned include funerals, as they also involve noise-making.
The Ghanaian Times joins the GTC in urging the public to observe the ban to uphold peace, harmony, and security within the Ga State.
It, therefore, appeals to religious and other traditional authorities within the Ga State to show respect by restraining their followers from making derogatory and inflammatory remarks about the ban.
The truth is that not all cultures and traditions of a people are bad.
This is where there is a need to seek an understanding of such practices, but not as in the case of the 12-year-old girl being married to an old man, which is a clear violation of the innocent girls rights.
Seeking an understanding of harmless but sometimes unclear cultural practices like the annual ban on noise-making prevents some people from trying to violate them because they do not see the essence of them.
The ban on noise-making, for instance, is observed because, in ancient times, the Gas were involved in farming and planted their seeds during the period. It was found that noise-making interfered with seed germination, so the one-month ban could help stem the interference.
It should marvel at the present generation how the ancient Gas came to that conclusion as primitive as they were thought to be.
Interestingly, research in modern times has proven that sound or noise has some impact on plant growth.
For instance, ResearchGate, a European commercial social networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, states that depending on the frequency and intensity of SV (structural variation) and US sounds [or noise], they can positively or negatively affect different biological functions of plants such as germination, the cell cycle, shoot, root, and callus growth and development.
Today, a greater percentage of Ga lands are built up, meaning farming is less practiced in the state, yet the ban on noise-making has some significance.
If nothing at all, it reminds everyone of the intellect of the Gas, which can be applied in farming communities today with the assistance of agricultural scientists.
Ghana is an agrarian country, and any knowledge or technology that can enhance its agricultural production must be encouraged.
The rite may appear obsolete but not harmful, and it can be observed for as long as the Ga people want to deem it worthy.
Besides, it forms part of who they are.
The Ghanaian Times will continue to support all cultural practices in the country that help it develop, even if they have just some productive lessons for the people.
In that same vein, the paper will join the condemnation of obnoxious, restrictive, outdated, and harmful ones like minors being married to paedophiles.",,Editorial,  4 April 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Prepare-to-heed-forthcoming-ban-on-noise-making-1924554
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Smart schools project deserves particular attention,"Since education is touted as being the key to every countrys development and both education and development are dynamic, there is a need to always make education in tune with the current circumstances.
Therefore, the launch of the Smart Schools Project in the country, an initiative of the Ministry of Education with support from the Centre for National Distance Learning and Open Schools (CENDELOS), is very appropriate.
This is a project designed to equip students in the country with the requisite technological skills and know-how for modern educational achievement.
To make the project a reality, the government is set to provide about 1.3 million students with a tablet each and go ahead to construct 100 smart schools across all the countrys 16 regions to provide a modern learning environment and digital training.
Besides giving the public a firm assurance of its resolve to carry through the project, the government has provided the names of the 100 places where the smart schools will be located and the timelines for their completion.
The first 30 will be completed by the end of this year, and the remaining 70 in the next two years.
We do not know how much each of the schools will cost, but considering the high cost of goods and services in the country currently and the facilities to be provided in the buildings, as well as the dollarization of the economy, we can guess even the first 30 are going to cost millions of dollars, translating into billions of Ghana Cedis.
It is an open secret that public projects in the country are bedeviled with much corruption by way of over-invoicing, for instance, whose impact on the execution of the projects is dire.
Over-invoicing can inflate the cost of the project, and this, coupled with ever-increasing prices of goods and services, can throw the cost out of gear and stall the project.
Looking at the importance of and urgency of smart schools, we appeal to the Presidency and the Ministry of Education to pay particular attention to their construction and provision of the relevant facilities.
Just think about the fact that the project is in fulfillment of the UNs Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4), which is aimed at ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all by 2030.
In spite of the huge progress the Akufo-Addo government has made in the education sector, in terms of SDG4, the country is far behind time, so any acts that can draw the country further back must not be countenanced at all, not even in a small measure.
The Ghanaian Times is very much elated generally about the smart school project but particularly about the fact that the school buildings will be fitted with solar panels to have them off the national electricity grid.
Thus, hopefully, they will not suffer disruptions in energy supply, and with the infrastructure going to be made to meet the countrys unique climatic conditions, no doubt, the smart schools will provide a conducive atmosphere for teaching and learning.",,Editorial, 27 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Smart-schools-project-deserves-particular-attention-1923438
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Review road safety control measures,"Since its establishment, the National Road Safety Authority (NRSA) has been organising campaigns to ensure road safety in the country.
Of particular note are the special Christmas and Easter campaigns organised annually to remind drivers of their responsibility to save lives while discharging their duties.
Last Friday, the NRSA, in partnership with the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, launched in Accra the 2024 Stay-Alive Easter Campaign.
At the launch, the NRSA asked drivers to strictly adhere to road safety regulations to prevent road crashes during this years Easter festivities, which begin this Friday until next Monday, April 1.
What the whole thing means is that there will be an increase in passengers this week, and a good number of people will travel to their hometowns and elsewhere for the festivities and return to base afterward, which causes drivers to want to employ all means possible to increase their takings.
Even though the NRSA believes strict adherence would help reduce the number of cases of road accidents, deaths, and injuries in the country during the festive period, we think the previous campaigns have not helped much, as the statistics show on average that the country consistently experiences increases in road crashes.
For instance, available statistics indicate that 2,260 crashes involving 3,910 vehicles have occurred in the first two months of this year, compared with 2,249 crashes involving 3,857 vehicles during the same period last year.
The sad thing is that while last years clashes killed 330 people, injured 2,502 people, and recorded 382 pedestrian knockdowns, this years (2024) have killed 369, injured 2,552 people, and knocked down 381.
The 2024 increases over the 2023 figures in percentage terms are 0.49 percent for crashes, 1.37 percent for vehicles involved, 11.82 percent for fatalities, and 2.0 percent for the injured.
Drivers in the country keep defying road safety regulations as the major causes of crashes remain mostly human errors.
These errors are mostly fatigue, drunk driving, reckless driving, including wrong over-taking.
At this juncture, we think three things should be the focus of road safety in the country: driver education focusing on the psychology of the driver, the strict management of the leadership of drivers unions as well as vehicle owners, and truly punitive laws.
Has the NRSA taken note of the types of drivers in the country and pointed out this in the bid to educate drivers, vehicle owners, and drivers union managers or leaders?
Like all humans, drivers exhibit certain negative traits, but their cases are normally more dangerous because they are doing so on the road.
We have, for instance, fatigued drivers who, despite their tiredness, would still insist on driving.
What about distracted, rushed, emotional, and new/inexperienced drivers?
Let us get to know who all these drivers are and use their traits to educate them and other stakeholders.",,Editorial, 26 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Review-road-safety-control-measures-1923281
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Provide enough sports facilities to hone talents,"The Ghanaian Times is delighted that the 13th African Games, Accra 2023, which the country hosted from March 8 to 23, 2024, have come to a successful end.
Many would agree that the 16-day event is historic for various reasons.
It recorded no incident that could have taken away its shine; the complaints about the hockey pitch raised by the South Africans were flimsy and so had no effect.
Also, the foreigners who came to the country for the sports festival did not complain of ill-treatment, which means that Ghanaian hospitality has been demonstrated.
It is our hope that the over 5000 athletes and their officials, as well as others like international sports officials and foreign media personnel, can testify to the festivals billing.
We congratulate all these people on helping to make the festival a success, but special compliments to our medal winners.
Also, we extend heartfelt congratulations to Egypt for earning the right to host the festival for the second time in Cairo, from January 20 to February 7, 2027, having hosted the 1991 Games.
For Ghanaians, it was a great pride that their country should host the games for the first time, with its athletes displaying sterling performances.
The country won 68 medals, comprising 19 gold, 29 silver, and 20 bronze, with the medal haul being described as the largest so far in its history at the prestigious continental event.
The outstanding performance caused President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
to extend wholehearted congratulations and gratitude to the countrys team (including the coaches, officials, and support staff), and he did this in a speech he delivered at the official closing ceremony held on Saturday.
A quote from his speech sums it all up, and we reproduce it here: To each and every member of the Ghanaian team, I commend you for your dedication, perseverance, and unwavering commitment to excellence. Your excellent achievements have not only brought glory to our nation but have also inspired a new generation of sportspeople across our beloved country. You have showcased the best of Ghana to the world.
While we join the President in commending those who helped to show the countrys glory on the continental sports platform, we want to take note of the reaffirmation of the governments commitment to promoting sports as a tool for national development and unity by harnessing its power to build a stronger, healthier, and more prosperous Ghana for generations to come.
We do not want to take this as a mere comment but one that must be made to materialize, and if it will materialise, then preparation for it must start now.
Ghanaians are tired of empty promises, the ineptitude of those in charge of sports development in the country, including the Ghana Football Association, and corruption in the sector.
These must cease forthwith, and the provision of facilities to constantly train athletes should be provided in all districts, while sports at the school, community, and district levels must be enhanced to hone talents in all sports disciplines.",,Editorial, 25 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Provide-enough-sports-facilities-to-hone-talents-1923097
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Heed Asantehenes advice regarding road contractors,"The importance of roads is synonymous with that of the road contractor, but the contractor can make this importance a reality with money to execute road projects.
However, it is common in Ghana that the government defers payments to contractors for reasons public officials deem fit; prominent among them is a lack of funds.
Sometimes payments can be delayed for a year, two, or more.
Contractors themselves and even some community members have complained about the problem of non-payment to road contractors due to the ramifications such as delayed or stalled work, layoffs, mounting interest on loans offered to contractors, and their inability to pay their suppliers.
Besides, sometimes some contractors suffer mistrust and threats from their workers, who think the contractors have received payments but do not want to give them their due.
A case in reference is the one in which the government failed to honour its promise to pay cocoa road contractors by the end of 2022, but their creditors, suppliers, and employees thought they had been paid and so started chasing them in early 2023.
Thus, on March 8, 2023, members of the Concerned Cocoa Road Contractors Association of Ghana marched to the office of the Ghana Chamber of Construction Industry for an emergency meeting with the leadership, where they threatened to take legal action if the money owed them was not paid by mid-April last year.
The contractors cannot be blamed for such agitations because sometimes some of them suffer starvation and health problems because they have spent their money on the projects they either executed in full or to a certain stage.
Oftentimes, one wonders why government officials treat contractors that way as if they are not aware of the suffering they cause the contractors, their suppliers, creditors, and workers, as well as families and communities.
Many are those who have spoken against the situation to no avail, so now the Asantehene,
Otumfuo Osei Tutu II
himself, has added his voice.
The Asantehene has called on the government to reconsider its payment methods to prevent situations where projects are left unfinished due to financial constraints.
He suggests that payments to road contractors should not necessarily be made in bulk but in bits or installments to provide them with the financial capacity to meet project completion deadlines.
Otumfuo Osei Tutu believes that when debts accumulate, it becomes very difficult to effect payment.
In Ghana, traditional leaders and the elderly wink at certain situations until they find it necessary to intervene in them.
This is exactly what Otumfuo has done, and there is no doubt that his voice carries enormous weight in national development.
We, therefore, believe that his intervention should change the status quo to bring some relief to contractors and all those who look up to them for one thing or another.
The change would also save the government all manner of embarrassment, such as when public officials have to be referred to for their failed promises to complete certain projects and the hardship they have caused the contractors and those they are accountable to in various ways.",,Editorial, 20 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Heed-Asantehene-s-advice-regarding-road-contractors-1922361
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Check internal factors to fix countrys economic woes,"It is now common knowledge that in May last year, the IMF Executive Board approved a US$3 billion 36-month extended credit facility arrangement for Ghana, out of which the global financial institution has so far disbursed two tranches of $600 million each.
Currently, the Managing Director (MD) of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, and a team are in the country to conclude the second review of the programme, whose successful completion will facilitate the release of the third tranche.
At a bilateral meeting on Sunday, the Minister of Finance-designate, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam, assured the IMF team of Ghanas commitment to keeping to the IMF programme in order that it would not be derailed.
We can fathom that this assurance is obviously coming as a result of the reshuffling of Mr. Ken Ofori Atta, the finance minister who started the process with the IMF.
It can also be a way of making the IMF accept that it is dealing with a state and not an individual.
On that score, we can conclude that Dr. Amin Adam is well aware of all the demands or conditionalities undergirding the successful completion of the programme.
Since the whole programme is about stabilising the countrys economy and stabilisation has to do with how well the economy is managed, we are happy to hear Dr. Amin Adam say, I will be aggressive on the revenue side and hold the line on expenditure.
We know the country is suffering financial stress because of financial mismanagement due to misappropriation and misapplication of state funds, overspending, and corruption.
For instance, in August 2019, www.occrp.org reported that Ghana had been losing US$3 billion to corruption annually, and in May 2022, chraj.gov.gh reported that corruption swallows 20 percent of the countrys budget. We are calling attention to information like this to remind the Minister of Finance-designate that he has an uphill task ahead of him.
Therefore, he should immediately plan how he would get stakeholders like the Ghana Revenue Authority, the Executive (the President and his inner circle), the Auditor-Generals Department, the police, the Attorney Generals Office, the judiciary, and even the media to help him succeed.
The reference to COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukraine war must stop because some of us see it as a flimsy excuse to avoid tackling the countrys major problem: failure to mobilise enough revenue and yet public officials penchant to overspend.
For how long should the country borrow? Usually, overspending results from excessive remunerations paid to public officials and over-ambitious state projects, which usually delay and call for re-evaluation that raises the cost.
We think at this juncture, we want to make reference to a remark by the IMF MD at Sundays meeting to the effect that Ghana has very bright prospects, and we need to do the right thing now for these prospects to materialise.
It is our hope that the government will adhere to the right steps, including policies that will promote the expected resilient and inclusive economic growth.",,Editorial, 19 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Check-internal-factors-to-fix-country-s-economic-woes-1922166
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Swift response to school problems paramount,"We commend the Minister of Education, Dr. Osei Yaw Adutwum, for tasking certain special teams to all regions of the country to ascertain the true state of affairs in connection with food supply in senior high schools (SHSs) and technical and vocational education and training institutions in the country.
His action follows reports and speculations about the irregular distribution of food items to SHS and TVET institutions across the country. In addition to the feedback from heads of schools and students, the teams checked the storage facilities and found that all the schools had an adequate stock of food.
The ministers approach is scientific as it captures the true state of affairs, and such an approach is what we expect all ministers and other leaders to adopt to solve problems in their jurisdictions.
Anything short of a scientific approach would not help in adopting the right measures to solve the problems or provide the expected response. This can worsen matters and bring embarrassment to a minister of state or any other leader, as it happens at times.
We know the minister is not the only public official doing that, though, and we encourage leaders at the helm of affairs across the country to be fond of the scientific approach to solving problems and make it a habit henceforth.
The benefits are enormous, including helping to dismiss rumours and propaganda, saving oneself embarrassment, and putting the minds of stakeholders at rest.
In the case of the education ministers move, for example, we believe parents of students at public SHSs and TVET institutions and other stakeholders in the education sector would have some relief.
Concerning the quality and quantity of food served in the schools, we wish to appeal that there must be regular unannounced checks because some of the stories in the public cannot be all mere rumours.
After all, there have been stories of thefts of food items by matrons and other kitchen staff members, which cause a reduction in the quantity of ingredients for preparing the food and subsequently the amount, quality, or taste of the food prepared.
According to the Ministry of Education, to ensure food security in the schools, there was prompt and up-to-date payment of funds allocated for the purchase of perishable food items for all schools. It is not clear whether the payment was affected by the food shortage rumours.
Whatever the case is, we hear of heads of schools complaining about the late release of such funds, which definitely affects the quantity and quality of food given to students.
We, therefore, wish to suggest that such releases be done in good time. The Ghanaian Times hopes the ministry will continuously honour its promise of considering any school that has a peculiar challenge concerning food supply as a special case and treating it urgently.
It is only when the ministry provides a swift and hands-on response to school problems that parents and all other stakeholders in the education sector will have confidence that the government prioritises the welfare of students, including the overall enhancement of their food security.",,Editorial, 18 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Swift-response-to-school-problems-paramount-1921974
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Oti people must heed peace admonition,"We encourage the feuding factions in the communal conflict at Nkwanta in the Nkwanta-South Municipality of the Oti Region to heed the advice given to them to lay down their arms and engage in dialogue to settle their differences amicably.
The admonition from the Oti Regional Minister-designate, DSP Daniel Machator, must be evaluated and embraced in the face of its underlying reason.
He says the development of the region depends on peace, which is a prerequisite for progress, and so it has now become imperative that all disputes in the region be addressed amicably for a conducive environment to spur the regions development.
It is not a good commentary that the region is entangled with chieftaincy and other conflicts that would lead to tension and unrest, thereby posing a significant threat to the development of the region.
We think the minister-designate is being magnanimous in his choice of words when and if he says, The conflicts would lead to tension and unrest.
We recall, for instance, that in a renewed tribal conflict involving the Challah, Akyode, and Adele people at Nkwanta, the capital of the Nkwanta South Municipality of the Oti Region, in November last year, four people were shot dead and others injured in a day.
The fighting also resulted in the burning of some houses in the town.
Consequently, some people fled the town and were displaced elsewhere.
This is a picture of what conflicts can do, and so even though we have to be careful in our choice of words when dealing with conflicts in order not to inflame passions, we must be ready to be forthright with the facts.
Even though we agree that all factions in conflicts have their vested interests, they should accept that it can take only an amicable settlement to serve the larger good, which obviously is what all the factions actually aim at.
There can be elements in all factions who would do everything to hinder efforts for peace because of their parochial interests.
Therefore, the factions must not be conscious of only what they actually want addressed but also those of their opponents, so the spirit of consensus can reign in every negotiation.
That way, it would be rare to have many conflicts taking root and festering in the country.
Unfortunately, that spirit of consensus-building has been ignored, making conflicts fester and resulting in all manner of unpalatable situations.
Think of the loss of lives and property to needless conflicts, as well as the loss of livelihoods and displacement of people.
What can be more painful when you are forced to leave your native home or a place you have chosen to be your home?
You would have to start life afresh at your new settlement, with all its attendant problems.
More importantly, planning for the development of the conflict areas by state authorities is also in disarray.
Oti Region is a new region that needs to be developed, and conflicts can mar all the efforts.
Therefore, all factions there must heed the advice to seek peace for that purpose so that people living there, for that matter, all Ghanaians, would find joy in the land of their birth.",,Editorial, 13 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Oti-people-must-heed-peace-admonition-1921394
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Treat passage of Human Organ and Tissue Bill with urgency!!,"Many people consider the eyes to be the most important of the human senses because they provide vision, which is the ability to see.
Even though some blind people have become renowned achievers, blindness in many people has devastated their lives because it has inhibited the use of their potential in many areas of life.
This is why it is sad to hear that about 26,000 Ghanaians in need of cornea transplants risk losing their vision due to the absence of a law to support the harvesting of tissues locally.
The eye is made up of many parts, including the iris, pupils, lens, macula, choroid, optic nerve, cornea, and sclera, which work to complement each other.
What that means is that a defect or disease affecting any of the parts of the eye does not augur well for good vision.
The importance of the eyes makes it imperative that eye health be prioritised by every country.
In view of this, one wonders why eye health experts in the country are now bemoaning the absence of a law to back the local harvesting of tissues like the cornea, knowing very well that such a law has been in place elsewhere for years.
It is on record that corneal transplantation started in the late 1800s, with the first eye bank established nearly 90 years ago and the procedure having been done routinely since the 1960s.
It is said that at present, there are more than 44,000 corneal transplants done globally every year.
This means if getting the tissues for the procedure needs legislation, then the bottom line is that those providing the tissues have already sought that legislation.
Is it now that corneal transplantation has become an issue in eye care in the country, such that it was only last year that the Human Organ and Tissue Bill was drafted to seek legal backing for organ and tissue donation as well as transplantation in the country?
The bill seeks, among other things, to not only create a national authority to oversee and regulate organ or tissue donation and transplantation but also to protect the rights and interests of donors, recipients, and their families while ensuring ethical and legal standards around such procedures to meet the growing demand in the country.
The purpose of the bill, when passed into law, is enormous, which demands that lawmakers treat its passage with urgency.
Imagine, for instance, that when the Human Organ and Tissue Bill becomes law, it will help establish eye banks and provide fair and much-needed transplantation services to help restore sight to thousands in the country.
Corneal surgeons in the country cannot perpetually be dependent on sourcing tissues from abroad, which is both costly and time-consuming.
The world has come to a point where almost every endeavour needs legal backing; otherwise, even things done with good intentions can end up in all manner of disputes and battles.
Think about it: for the most part, corneal donation comes from people who are dead, and it is in very rare circumstances that a donor may be living.",,Editorial, 12 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Treat-passage-of-Human-Organ-and-Tissue-Bill-with-urgency-1921225
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Welcome to 13th African Games,"The 13th African Games, dubbed African Games Accra 2023, opened in Accra on Friday.
Running from March 8 to March 23, the sporting event, formerly called the All African Games, is gathering over 4,000 athletes from across the continent to compete in various sports disciplines in two cities: Accra and Cape Coast.
The three-week event, being organised in association with the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa and the Association of Africa Sports Confederations, also doubles as a qualifier for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
It is instructive to note that the Games are held every four years and a year before the Olympics.
We welcome the athletes and officials to the country, and we know all of them will experience the proverbial Ghanaian hospitality.
To that end, we appeal to all those who will happen to serve the visitors and even local athletes and officials, as well as fans, to be the Ghanaians that the whole world expects to see.
Originally scheduled to take place in August 2023, the Games were postponed to March 2024 but had to maintain their name, hence African Games 2023.
One of the reasons for the delay was that Ghana had difficulties completing the required facilities.
Now that the Games are running, it is obvious that the country has done its best in the provision of those facilities.
We are happy that because of the Games, the country can now boast about some sporting facilities, including the $145 million (132.5 million) sports complex at Borteyman and the University of Ghana stadium, which had been under construction for two decades.
We are happier when it is touted that some of the facilities provided are world-class.
We are only sad that most of the continents popular athletes will not feature in the Games because the delayed Games are now taking place so close to the Paris Olympics in July, and those athletes want to prepare for Paris 2024.
Even though their absence can take some shine from the Games, we believe it would give some young and unknown athletes the opportunity to showcase their talents and consequently earn a place on the global sporting platform.
We, therefore, encourage all the participants in the Games to prove their mettle, and even those who do not win medals should count it as an opportunity to spur them on to prepare more for the years ahead, bearing in mind that their time will surely come one day.
Apart from the benefits the host country and the athletes and officials would gain from the Games, we think the pan-African nature of the event itself has a message for African countries.
In the world today, the best message is the one that emphasizes unity, peace, and teamwork, or togetherness.
Africans must not come together only for sporting activities but on every field that can bring the continent togetherness, peace, prosperity, and progress.
Africa must leverage that spirit behind the power that brings its people of diverse cultures and backgrounds together to compete in sports to, for instance, improve its political leadership in particular to improve the lot of the people.
We wish the visitors to the country a happy stay and pray for an unprecedentedly successful African Games in 2023.",,Editorial, 11 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Welcome-to-13th-African-Games-1921034
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Happy International Womens Day,"Today is International Womens Day (IWD).
Congratulations to all women across the globe.
The day started to be observed in the early 1990s on different dates in various countries until 1975, when the United Nations began celebrating it on March 8.
The day has resulted from womens agitations for fair treatment and a better life wherever they are.
The records have it, for instance, that mens oppression and inequality spurred women in the US and Europe to become more vocal and active in campaigning for change.
No wonder the date for marking IWD has its root in the arrest on March 8, 1914, of Sylvia Pankhurst while on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square in London at one of the rallies organised by women across Europe to campaign against the First World War and to express womens solidarity in all the things they were fighting for across the globe.
On the occasion of celebrating women today, we pay tribute to the women who played front-line roles in fighting for a better life for women, such as Clara Zetkin, leader of the Womens Office for the Social Democratic Party in Germany, who, in addition to other roles, tabled the idea of an IWD.
The history of IWD must be read or studied by all people who are interested in the progress of women.
Today, women are calling for a better life for themselves and, in addition, for their children.
It is sad that societies across the globe are still male-dominated in everything except population numbers.
Chauvinism has become the bane of female progress in contemporary societies, a situation that does not augur well for the progress of society.
But for women and their physiology, the human race would have ceased to exist, and that role alone should be a good basis for pampering women in some way.
Women leading good lives in terms of having attained an acceptable education and enjoying some good socioeconomic status most often keep good families.
That is to say, if women were helped to overcome their present precarious situations, society would be full of people prepared enough to see to its progress.
This is why we agree with the United Nations (UN) on its theme for celebrating IWD 2024: Invest in women: Accelerate progress.
Even though women face a variety of problems, those in developed countries have better lives than those in poor or developing countries like Ghana.
We, therefore, wish the UNs theme for IWD this year would appeal more to governments in developing countries to help improve womens lives.
A good life for women means a good life for children, and the cycle continues, with the result being a prosperous nation.
We encourage women in privileged positions everywhere to highlight womens needs, particularly those of the underprivileged, and agitate about them until governments meet them.
We know some of the needs could be country-specific, and so we encourage privileged Ghanaian women, for example, to play their roles effectively, such as fighting for the Affirmative Action Bill to be passed into law.
Once again, congratulations to women for celebrating IWD today.",,Editorial,  8 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Happy-International-Women-s-Day-1920650
Editorial by Ghanaian Times: Ponder over significance of independence,"Yesterday, Ghanaians marked the 67th anniversary of their countrys independence from the British colonial masters.
The Ghanaian Times congratulates Ghana on succeeding in wresting independence from the British.
The commemoration of March 6, 1957, came with a variety of events or activities at the national, regional, district, and community levels.
Some members of the public also celebrated the day with some group and even individual or personal activities.
All such events or activities generally depict just the euphoria associated with the day Ghana gained its independence.
We think celebrating the day that way is only ritualistic if both the countrys native managers and the people fail to reflect on the true nature of independence vis-a-vis their responsibilities and rights in moving the country forward.
Thus, we wish to remind ourselves of some things Ghanaians should consider any time they commemorate the countrys independence.
It is common knowledge that Ghana being independent means no foreign power maintains any control over the political or civil processes of its government and people.
That is to say, its sovereignty, which is the right of the country to chart its own future through self-determination, is assured.
However, this sovereignty can remain intact when the country achieves economic freedom, maintains a robust judicial system, upholds an education system, develops the ability of individuals to make critical decisions that enhance the progress of their total lives, and focuses attention on the social mechanisms of the lives of the people, which include cultural values and community safety.
In a multi-cultural country like Ghana, the state must take note of which social acts are acceptable in one cultural environment and not in another and see how that will not undermine the peace of the whole country.
The state must also have respect for the environment, in which case it controls activities that cause pollution, global warming, ocean acidification, ozone layer depletion, and loss of biodiversity, as well as undermine public health.
We agree that independence notwithstanding, we live in a global village, where diplomatic pressures and bilateral cooperation are critical for the countrys advancement in a way, yet we need to prevent injurious external influence.
However, Ghana usually succumbs to external pressures that injure its cultural values and economic aspirations, all because of a lack of the financial muscle to develop the country, which consequently calls for dependence on external assistance that comes with its own conditions.
Imagine that the countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is largely dependent on investment by foreign companies.
Meanwhile, the country is endowed with the natural resources that can give it the economic must but for mismanagement by its leadership, corruption, injustice, and the poor working attitude of the people.
It is also the case that the people do not demand accountability from their leaders at all levels, and politicians in particular are taking advantage of the situation to feed their personal interests through corruption and any other bad means.
Until the problems are fixed for the country to see progress, the annual commemoration of its independence is a fruitless venture that profits only the organisers of the celebrations.",,Editorial,  7 March 2024,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Editorial-by-Ghanaian-Times-Ponder-over-significance-of-independence-1920471
