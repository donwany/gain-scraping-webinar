1,"Mahama meets CSOs on the establishment of a Governance Advisory Council.","President John Dramani Mahama has met with representatives of various Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) at the Presidency to discuss the formation of a Governance Advisory Council, a key pledge from his 2024 election campaign to bolster accountability and transform governance in Ghana.
President Mahama elaborated on the proposed council’s mandate, emphasising its crucial role in monitoring and advising the government on critical issues such as human rights, corruption, and overall governance.
“This council is a commitment to the Ghanaian people, a promise to foster a more transparent and accountable government,” President Mahama stated during the meeting.
“President Mahama believes that by bringing together the wisdom and expertise of civil society, religious leaders, traditional authorities, academia, labour, and ordinary Ghanaians, we can create a powerful mechanism for ensuring that our governance truly reflects the values and aspirations of our nation”, a statement to the Press after the meeting stated.
As promised during his campaign, the President expects the Governance Advisory Council to function as an independent watchdog responsible for producing an annual report on the state of human rights, corruption, and governance in Ghana. He explained that this report would be publicly accessible and serve as a guide for the government to evaluate its progress and address areas in need of improvement.
“This annual report will not be just another document gathering dust on a shelf,” the President stated during his campaign engagements in 2024. “It will be a living, breathing instrument for change, holding us accountable and pushing us to do better on issues ranging from human rights violations and corruption to media freedoms and the fight against torture and crime.”
Senior President Advisor for Governmental Affairs, Dr Valerie Sawyerr, has been tasked with leading the government’s effort to establish the Council.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-meets-csos-on-the-establishment-of-a-governance-advisory-council/","26 May 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:02.115548"
2,"Damango to host the Catholic Science and Technology University – President Mahama.","President John Dramani Mahama has announced that Damongo, the Savannah regional capital, will host two major projects: a Catholic Science and Technology University and a regional hospital that will serve as a teaching facility.
The President made the announcement during a courtesy call by Most Reverend Philip Naameh, Catholic Metropolitan Archbishop of Tamale, at the Presidency in Accra.
According to President Mahama, initial funding for the proposed university will come from the grant promised by the Chinese President.
The regional hospital, he explained, “shall also serve as a teaching facility for the proposed Catholic Science and Technology University, which will have a Faculty of Medical Sciences to train medical doctors and other allied health professionals.”
The President reiterated the government’s commitment to revamp the nation’s Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions during the discussions.

The visits, which followed last Friday’s state funeral, were intended to comfort the bereaved and to assure them of the Government’s continued support.
The Vice‑President reiterated the administration’s commitment to work closely with the families to address their welfare needs, particularly those of the widows and children left behind.
The families visited were those of the late Samuel Sarpong, Vice Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC); Samuel Aboagye, Deputy Director General, National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO); Alhaji Mohammed Muniru Limuna, Deputy National Security Coordinator (Human Security); Dr Edward Kofi Omane Boamah, former Defence Minister; and Alhaji Dr Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, former Minister for Environment, Science and Technology.

7,"Mahama Challenges African Leaders: Health is Economic Engine, Not Drain","President John Dramani Mahama today issued a strong challenge to fellow African leaders, urging them to abandon the outdated notion that health spending hampers national economies. Instead, he advocated for health as a vital investment and the “engine of productivity,” essential for the continent’s inclusive growth.
Speaking at a high-profile Accra Health Sovereignty Summit in Accra, President Mahama called for a fundamental shift away from dependence on donor support for health infrastructure.
He advocated for a “new multilateralism,” grounded in co-creation and mutual respect, rather than extraction or charity.
“The outdated notion that health drains our economies must be rejected,” President Mahama declared in his keynote address. “In truth, health is the engine of productivity and the bedrock of inclusive growth.”
To underscore his point, the President cited World Health Organisation (WHO) research indicating that every $1 invested in health resilience yields up to $4 in returns. He emphasised that this return is even greater in Africa, given its youthful populations and “latent economic dynamism.”
“Every malaria case prevented is a day of work regained. Every maternal death avoided is a family stabilised. Every vaccinated child is a future secured,” he stated, illustrating the tangible economic and social benefits of health investment.
President Mahama, who convened the Accra Meeting, urged economists across the continent to revise national accounts to reflect health as a productivity multiplier rather than a mere consumption expense. He implored Ministers of Finance to treat health as a capital investment.
To achieve this paradigm shift, he outlined a three-pronged strategy:
1. Globally: Championing a new health governance architecture that reflects a multipolar, digitally interconnected, and climate-challenged world.
2. Regionally: Scaling up homegrown solutions.
3. Nationally: Demonstrating the political will to mobilise funds and promote good governance fit for 21st-century realities, moving beyond mere plans.
Success, he observed, would hinge on scaling innovations such as PANABIOS for data health verification and pandemic preparedness, PROPER for transparent medical supply chains, and BIONOVAC to transform vaccine production from molecule to market.
“In Ghana, we have not stood still,” noted. The President announced the “uncapping” of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) financing, effectively opening up approximately 3.5 billion cedis more in fiscal space for broader and deeper health coverage.
He also referred to the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares), designed to mobilise public, private, and philanthropic capital to tackle chronic disease burdens like hypertension, diabetes, and kidney failure.
The President announced plans to launch a national Primary Healthcare Programme in the coming months, which will come along with the recruitment of community health volunteers. These initiatives, he noted, represent a significant step forward in preventive care, aimed at improving the general health and wellness of citizens.
The high-profile Africa Health Sovereignty Summit attracted a remarkable group of leaders and experts, including former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former Mauritius President Dr Ameenah Firdaus Gurib-Fakim, and the Director-General of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The summit convened health professionals from across the continent and the diaspora, global experts, non-profit organisations, investors, donors, and students, all committed to advancing health equity and sovereignty in Africa.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-challenges-african-leaders-health-is-economic-engine-not-drain/","05 August 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:02.477135"
8,"Japanese business to invest $100m to make Ghana Africa’s first AI-powered agriculture hub.","Degas Limited has announced a $100 million investment over the next four years to help establish Ghana as Africa’s first AI-powered agricultural hub, expanding a model that has already financed more than 86,000 smallholder farmers across 122,000 acres nationwide.
“Ghana has shown that when technology meets a clear national vision, smallholder farmers can thrive,” said Doga Makiura, CEO and founder of Degas Limited, at a meeting with President John Dramani Mahama on the sidelines of the Ghana Presidential Investment Forum.
“Our $100 million commitment will scale AI-driven satellite monitoring and precision agriculture techniques so farmers can boost yields, reduce risk, and access fairly priced finance.”
“We’ve already seen incomes double with a 95% repayment rate from the farmers”, he stated in the meeting with President Mahama.
Degas’ platform combines AI-driven satellite monitoring and agriculture techniques. The results, according to Makiura, are drawing strong interest from Japanese investors.
“Many Japanese partners now consider Ghana’s integrated approach the gold standard for agricultural investment in Africa,” he said.
“President Mahama’s focus on value-chain integration aligns closely with Japan’s search for credible, scalable partnerships.”
President Mahama welcomed the announcement, calling it a vote of confidence in Ghana’s agricultural transformation agenda.
“This investment reinforces our commitment to integrated agricultural value chains that connect farmers to markets, finance, storage, and processing,” he said.
“By leveraging AI and precision technologies, we will improve productivity, enhance food security, and create dignified jobs for youth across rural communities.”
The new funding will support the expansion of Degas’ farmer financing, satellite-enabled crop monitoring, and precision agronomy services, while deepening partnerships across input supply, logistics, and offtake to strengthen local value chains.","https://presidency.gov.gh/japanese-business-to-invest-100m-to-make-ghana-africas-first-ai-powered-agriculture-hub/","22 August 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:02.535373"

The critical gathering, themed “Building Resilience for Women and Girls in the Face of Climate Change and Conflict,” culminated in a unified campaign commitment from all participating First Ladies to address these pressing global challenges.
The discussions underscored the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation and armed conflicts on vulnerable populations, particularly women and girls, who often bear the brunt of displacement, resource scarcity, and increased violence.
A central outcome of the event was the collective commitment made by all First Ladies to a campaign pledge, which signifies a concerted effort to advocate for policies, mobilise resources, and implement programmes to target the unique challenges faced by women and girls in climate and conflict-affected regions.
Mrs Mahama’s commitment statement centred on the theme of “Strength.”
“I pledged to support this campaign that centres on African solutions and strength, which is rooted in its women and girls,” she stated. “In the face of climate and conflict challenges, their courage sustains families and communities.

12,"Ghana, Singapore push cross-border payments and SME ties as Mahama hails stabilising economy.","On the second day of his three-day state visit to Singapore, President John Dramani Mahama emphasised the importance of closer financial and technological cooperation, noting that Ghana is positioning itself as a continental gateway under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) while working to restore macroeconomic stability.
“Ghana provides a good gateway and push for Africa into the world,” Mahama said during bilateral talks with President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, pointing to AfCFTA, a youthful population and an untapped market in West Africa and Africa.
He noted that inflation “is down to about 13%” and the government is “targeting a single digit by the end of the year,” alongside “prioritising expenditure” and “ensuring fiscal discipline.”
A central theme of the bilateral talks was the interoperability of payments to unlock trade across African borders.
“It is not enough to sign protocols on free movement of people and goods… we must be able to pay for the goods across borders,” Mahama said.
He added that Ghana is backing continent-wide solutions, “including the start of the PAPSS,” the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, and wants to draw on Singapore’s expertise.
“Singapore has a comparative advantage over Africa when it comes to payment systems, and we are looking to learn from you,” he said.
President Tharman praised Ghana’s reform efforts.
“Ghana must succeed for West Africa and Africa to succeed, and I see that you… are dealing with the country’s issues, including the debt challenge, admiringly,” he said, calling Mahama’s address at the Africa Singapore Business Forum “a strong reflection of the bilateral relations between our two countries.”
Both leaders also flagged fintech, cross-border payments and SME development as near-term priorities.
“Other areas of interest are Fintech and payment systems, cross-border payments, development of SMEs… and we are ready and glad to pursue them together,” Tharman said.
Mahama congratulated Singapore on the city-state’s 60th anniversary of independence and noted that Ghana will mark its 70th anniversary in 2027, framing the partnership as one that can accelerate Africa–Asia commerce through practical financial connectivity as well as trade protocols.","https://presidency.gov.gh/ghana-singapore-push-cross-border-payments-and-sme-ties-as-mahama-hails-stabilising-economy/","27 August 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:02.780232"

The rest are Dr Kwame Ampofo – Ambassador to Hungary, Magnus Kofi Amoatey – Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Benedict Batatabe Assorow – Ambassador to the Holy See, Professor Mrs Esi Awuah – Ambassador to the Swiss Confederation, Kwesi Ahwoi – Ambassador to the Republic of Serbia, and Mohammed Abubakari Manaf – Ambassador to Benin.
The commissioning of the eleven on Wednesday brings the total number of ambassadors and high commissioners appointed by President John Dramani Mahama to twenty-nine.
In his remarks after the envoys took their oath of office and allegiance, President Mahama reaffirmed his government’s commitment to enhancing Ghana’s international presence. He also urged them to serve not only as an instrument of diplomatic prestige but also as a catalyst for national renewal, service, and opportunity.
“Your selection as ambassadors and high commissioners is no coincidence. It reflects years of dedicated service, discipline, and the confidence the state places in you to represent Ghana in your respective roles,” he noted.
President Mahama said a new framework of accountability underpins their appointments. He said for the first time in Ghana’s diplomatic practice, the government has introduced Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), a clear set of expectations that define their mandate, provide benchmarks for their assessment, and directly connect their work to national objectives.
“These KPIs are not merely bureaucratic checklists. They serve as tools for transformation. Their purpose is to ensure that each handshake, each negotiation, and every agreement you engage in delivers real benefits for the people of Ghana.”
He said the envoys had been thoroughly briefed on the Government’s Resetting Ghana Agenda, a national blueprint for restoring hope, rebuilding trust, and rekindling prosperity.
“The Reset agenda is not just a slogan. It’s a bold programme of reform and renewal that aims to make governance more accountable, the economy more resilient, and our society more inclusive,” he added.","https://presidency.gov.gh/eleven-more-envoys-commissioned/","02 October 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:02.843009"

President Assoumani is in Accra to take part in the Africa Prosperity Dialogue 2025.
Mr Mahama stated that Africa is a burgeoning continent with tremendous potential; however, the low level of trade and cooperation among our countries poses a significant drawback.
He added, “We believe that dialogues and forums such as the African Prosperity Dialogue would enable us to exchange views on enhancing our continent.”
He noted that many countries are adopting visa-free arrangements on the continent to allow the free movement of people, goods, and services between them. Ghana believes that African people should be able to move freely across the continent.
President Mahama championed the advancement of intra-African trade, emphasising Ghana’s role as host of the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as a significant honour.
“That’s why Ghana is doing everything to support the Secretariat,” he said.
President Assoumani expressed gratitude to President Mahama for the high protocol and warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation.
He congratulated President Mahama on his re-election and praised Ghanaians for a smooth presidential transition. He also commended Ghana for implementing the visa-free regime for holders of an African passport.

The President announced the return of the Global Mercy Ship hospital vessel to Ghana in August 2026, offering free specialised surgeries and intensive training for local healthcare professionals.
The renewed agreement was confirmed following a high-level meeting at the Presidency on Thursday, September 11, 2025, between President Mahama and members of the Mercy Ships Board.

The company has returned to the site, with officials reporting steady progress and an easing of the severe traffic that recently sparked public agitation.
During a site visit on Wednesday, President John Dramani Mahama said his administration has reassigned the project as part of the Big Push initiative, which has GHS14 billion allocated this year and a further GHS30 billion expected next year.
“We will hold you to your word. You say by the end of the second quarter next year it should be finished,” the President said, stressing the corridor’s importance as a major arterial route linking Accra and Kumasi and serving large volumes of commuters, goods and services.
“As the government commits to paying you well, you too must commit to moving faster on the road and also use quality materials.”
Minister for Roads and Highways, Kwame Agbodza, confirmed the arrears have been fully cleared and said his ministry will enforce the revised timetable.
“We don’t owe the contractor any amount. I want to hold the contractor to his word that by the end of the second quarter of 2026, the project will be completed,” he said.
Maripoma Enterprise Limited has acknowledged receipt of payment and pledged to accelerate work to meet the June 2026 deadline.
The Ofankor–Nsawam project began in July 2022 with an initial completion date of July 2024. It stalled for many months due to mounting debt and worsening congestion along the corridor.

17,"President Mahama Ends ‘Thank You’ Tour: Calls for Unity, Economic Transformation, and Peace.","President John Dramani Mahama on Friday concluded his national ‘Thank You’ Tour triumphantly in Dambai, Oti Region. The tour, a journey of appreciation and dialogue, saw the President reaffirm his commitment to governing Ghana with sincerity, dedication, vision, and integrity.
Throughout his engagements across the 16 regions, President Mahama emphasised the crucial role of traditional leaders. He reiterated his dedication to strengthening traditional governance frameworks and improving the capacity of Chiefs to actively and meaningfully participate in national decision-making processes.
Addressing a lively and colourful durbar in Dambai, President Mahama gave an encouraging update on his administration’s flagship economic plan.
“I am pleased to report that our Reset Agenda is firmly on track,” he declared. “We have begun a bold and necessary journey—to reset our economy, rebuild national institutions, and restore hope. This is the Reset Agenda, grounded in fairness, discipline, inclusion, and accountability.”
He encouraged Ghanaians to embrace a new mindset and actively engage in the transformative national journey.
President Mahama called for collective action to unlock the potential of the country:
“The time to act is now. I urge you to embrace the opportunities presented by our flagship initiatives—from the 24-Hour Economy to the National Apprenticeship Programme, Free Primary Healthcare, Digital Governance, and Export-Led Industrialisation.”
A significant portion of the President’s address was dedicated to the indispensable role of peace in fostering national development. He expressed deep concern over the recent insecurity in Nkwanta, condemning the “unfortunate killing, maiming of innocent people and destruction to property over disagreements” as utterly unacceptable.
Mr Mahama said, “All these things I’ve talked about, all this infrastructure development I’ve talked about, cannot take place if we do not have peace. And that’s why the development in Nkwanta is troubling.”
He made a fervent appeal to all parties involved, “I wish to appeal to all those in Nkwanta who are involved in the conflict to please lay down your arms.”
Responding to an appeal by Nana Soglo Alloh IV, Paramount Chief of the Likpe Traditional Area and President of the Oti Regional House of Chiefs, for a military barracks in Nkwanta, President Mahama stated that there is a need for local, sustainable solutions over military intervention.
He argued that resources dedicated to a military camp could be better invested in life-changing development projects.
“It’s completely unacceptable,” he stated firmly. “Let’s use our traditional mechanisms to establish peace. We should be fighting poverty, not fighting each other. We should be asking for hospitals and schools and jobs and things, not military camps.”
The President shared positive feedback from the 2025 Mid-year Budget Review, indicating Ghanaians are satisfied with the government’s economic management so far.
He defined the “Reset Agenda” as a bold journey to reset our economy, rebuild national institutions, and restore hope, all grounded in fairness, discipline, inclusion, and accountability.

The President expressed deep concern about the insecurity in Nkwanta, appealing for an end to the conflict.

Receiving the envoys separately at The Presidency, President Mahama highlighted opportunities for expanded collaboration in trade, investment, energy, and security, and thanked the diplomats for their service.
The first to call was Angola’s outgoing ambassador, João Domingos Baptista Quiosa, who concluded a four-year tour in Ghana.
He traced Ghana–Angola relations to 1959, recalling how President Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, through liberation networks, supported Angola’s struggle for independence.
Ambassador Baptista Quiosa noted that with Ghana’s support, Angola has expanded large-scale cocoa cultivation and that many Angolan students now study in Ghana.
President Mahama called for greater collaboration and knowledge-sharing, particularly in oil and gas and renewable energy.
Malta’s outgoing ambassador, Jean Claude Galea Mallia, who served in Ghana for more than seven years, described his departure as deeply emotional, citing strong personal experiences.
He said Malta would continue to partner with Ghana, especially under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and pointed to rapid growth in trade. He also noted that Ghana now ranks fifth among Malta’s export destinations after the United States.
President Mahama said ongoing reforms aim to position Ghana as a business hub for the subregion.
“Ghana alone cannot fully leverage the investment opportunities available and is ready to partner with others to tap the huge potential,” he added.

He was speaking during a courtesy call from the Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan.
The President stated that these strategic reforms, begun just six months into his administration, are already showing tangible results.
He spoke about the renewed business confidence, the relative appreciation of the Cedi, and a decreasing inflation rate as important signs of economic stability and progress, especially after recent global challenges and inherited public debt burdens.
“We are striving to cultivate a new sense of thinking, a fresh approach to doing things, and to ensure that we effectively serve the people who elected us to lead,” President Mahama stated.
He elaborated on key government initiatives, including the ’24-Hour Economy’ policy, drawing inspiration from London, a city he described as “never sleeping.”

25,"President launches ambitious Ghana infrastructure plan; a renewed vision for dev’t through 2057.","President John Dramani Mahama has officially launched the Ghana Infrastructure Plan (GIP), marking a pivotal step in the nation’s long-term development strategy.
Spearheaded by the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), the GIP outlines Ghana’s ambitious vision and strategic direction for infrastructure development, serving as the physical embodiment of the country’s social and economic aspirations.
“Today, we gather not just for a launch, but to rekindle a vision. This is a journey that began over a decade ago when I had the honour, as President, to initiate the development of a long-term infrastructure plan for our beloved country,” President Mahama stated.
He described the GIP as a bold and forward-looking national blueprint set to guide Ghana’s infrastructure journey through to 2057.
President Mahama explained that the GIP provides a 30-year strategic framework that outlines how Ghana will design, finance, and implement infrastructure projects to improve the quality of life and support sustainable economic growth. He emphasised that this plan is not just about building physical structures but about shaping the nation’s future.
“But as we look ahead, we must also look back, for every renewal starts with reflection,” he remarked.
Referencing Ghana’s history, President Mahama recalled the country’s first comprehensive development blueprint, the Seven-Year Development Plan launched in 1963 under Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah.
“Dr Nkrumah recognised that infrastructure was the foundation of a modern, industrialised, and self-reliant nation. He built roads, railways, schools, and energy systems to connect our people and unlock Ghana’s productive potential. That vision was bold, patriotic, and transformative. It remains timeless even today.”
Despite these historical ambitions, President Mahama acknowledged the challenges that have hindered progress. Citing the 2024 National Annual Progress Report by the NDPC, he revealed that over $70 billion in cost overruns have been recorded across 18,000 capital projects, with many facing significant delays or abandonment.
He candidly admitted, “We must reflect on the painful truth that, despite our ambition, infrastructure delivery has often been fragmented, politicised, and inefficient. We inherited Nkrumah’s dream, but we have yet to fulfil its promise.”
The President stressed that the GIP represents a strategic reset, aligning Ghana’s infrastructure development efforts with the government’s Big Push Agenda, the African Union’s Agenda 2063, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
The plan introduces a new integrated planning model designed to promote balanced regional development and ensure equitable access to opportunities for all Ghanaians.
Noting the history of the plan, President Mahama pointed out, “The Ghana Infrastructure Plan was initially completed in 2016 and revised in 2019, but it was shelved for years. Today, we reaffirm this framework as essential for national transformation.”
He concluded with a rallying call: “Let us not just build roads and bridges, but a Ghana that works for everyone and where vision meets discipline, and where continuity, transparency, and innovation illuminate the path to a shared future.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-launches-ambitious-ghana-infrastructure-plan-a-renewed-vision-for-devt-through-2057/","22 October 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:03.648356"
26,"”Early Testing Saves Lives,” First Lady stresses at Free Health Screening for vulnerable groups.","First Lady, Mrs. Lordina Dramani Mahama, on Friday, addressed beneficiaries at a comprehensive free public health screening event, emphasising the vital importance of early testing and proactive health management, especially for vulnerable populations within the community.
The event, a collaboration between the Office of the First Lady and the Ghana AIDS Commission, provided essential health services to various community members, including hairdressers, tailors, head-porters (kayayee), and market women.
Addressing the gathering, Mrs. Mahama underscored the purpose of the outreach. “We are here for a very important reason. For the health of our people, especially young people, women, and vulnerable groups in our communities,” she stated. “We aim to raise awareness, offer free check-ups, provide medical advice and counselling, and help more people take care of their health.”
The First Lady said many people may be living with serious health conditions without realising it, making such screening exercises essential.
“Sometimes, people are living with these conditions and do not even know it. That is why today’s health screening is very important,” she explained. “It provides an opportunity to get tested free of charge, know about their health, and take the necessary steps to maintain their health.”
She stressed the life-saving potential of early detection. “Early testing saves lives. Knowing your health status early enables you to start treatment early and prevent serious complications. Testing early can also help us to protect our loved ones.”
“For example, when people living with HIV get to know their status early, they can receive the right care and support, which will make them live long and healthy lives. But this can only happen if you get tested.”
The free health services provided at the event included HIV and syphilis screening, BMI and nutrition counselling, blood pressure checks and assessments for other medical conditions, and breast cancer screening.
Beneficiaries received awareness training on HIV/AIDS preventive measures and the importance of early antenatal care to prevent mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
Directing her message towards the younger generation present, the First Lady called for greater health consciousness. “I want to address the young people here directly. You are the future of this country. Your energy, your dreams and your well-being matter,” she said.
“However, many young people today are falling ill, sometimes due to a lack of access to the right information, services, or support they need. That must change. And it starts with talking openly to people who can help you, and by having a medical check at least once a year.”
She encouraged attendees to take full advantage of the services offered free of charge. “Today, you can check your HIV status, your blood pressure and sugar levels, and even be screened for breast cancer, right here at this event, all for free… I therefore encourage you all to take advantage of these services. Feel free to ask any questions that come to mind. We are here for you.”
Mrs. Mahama also highlighted broader government efforts aimed at improving access to and outcomes in healthcare. She mentioned the recently launched Ghana Medical Trust Fund, also known as MahamaCares.
“When this fund is fully operational, it will bring relief to many people suffering from non-communicable diseases,” she noted, adding that it will help diagnose and treat conditions like heart illnesses, kidney disease, and various cancers.
She also referenced the upcoming Free Primary Healthcare Programme, which she said will “enhance awareness of the health status of our citizens and contribute to disease prevention.”
“Together, we can create a Ghana where every person knows their health status. Where every pregnant woman gets the care she needs, and where every child is born healthy and free from infection,” she stated.","https://presidency.gov.gh/early-testing-saves-lives-first-lady-stresses-at-free-health-screening-for-vulnerable-groups/","06 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:03.716763"
27,"MEDIA ADVISORY: President Mahama to Launch ‘The Accra Reset’ at UNGA 2025.","President John Dramani Mahama, the African Union Champion for African Financial Institutions, will host a landmark high-level event on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly to formally launch “The Accra Reset: Reimagining Global Governance for Health and Development.”
This pivotal initiative will introduce a bold and actionable framework designed to fundamentally transform the global governance architecture, ensuring it is fit-for-purpose in a turbulent, post-SDG era.
The event will convene an influential assembly of Heads of State, leaders of multilateral institutions, philanthropic organisations, business innovators, and civil society representatives from across Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and global institutions.
Key Announcements & Impact:
At this event, President Mahama will formally announce the establishment of a Global Presidential Council, which is a pioneering body comprising Heads of State and Government from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and other key regions.
The Council will provide political leadership to drive The Accra Reset’s agenda. It will subsequently constitute a High-Level Advisory Panel, bringing together renowned leaders from health, finance, innovation, and business, ensuring both political will and intellectual rigour in forging new models for global cooperation.
Why This Matters Now:
The MDGs and SDGs have served as critical guiding stars, lifting millions out of poverty and fostering unprecedented cooperation.
However, the UN’s 2023 review highlighted that fewer than half of the 169 SDG targets are on track, with global health, inequality, and fiscal resilience in particularly dire straits.
As 2030 approaches, the world needs more than another list of promises.
The Accra Reset asserts that the era of “development-as-usual” is over. What is required now is a fundamental re-engineering, a Reset of the very logic of global cooperation.
Building on the August 2025 Africa Health Sovereignty Summit held in Accra, this initiative proposes a new operating logic: one that prioritises resilient coalitions, syndicates, and agile platforms capable of delivering concrete results amidst global polycrises.
The health sector, acutely exposed to global shocks and an unsustainable aid paradigm, serves as the initial focus for demonstrating this new thinking and inspiring systemic action across all development sectors.

As we implement the 2025 Theme of the Year on Justice for Africans and People of African Descent through reparations, we reaffirm our shared resolve to correct historical wrongs and injustices through restitution, healing and holistic systemic transformation.”
This powerful declaration was made by H.E. John Dramani Mahama, President of Ghana and the African Union Champion for Reparations, as he delivered a progress report in Malabo on the AU’s 2025 Theme, “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent through Reparations.”
Addressing the 7th Mid-Year Coordination Meeting of the African Union, President Mahama stated that notable progress has been achieved by the AU Commission and Member States in implementing the theme.
He expressed particular satisfaction with the recent decision by the Executive Council to extend the focus on reparations for a decade, covering the period from 2026 to 2036.
“This undoubtedly affords us, as a Union, the opportunity to sustain the momentum for the realisation of this noble cause, as well as map out well-thought-out strategies to mobilise adequate resources to champion implementation of the theme domestically,” President Mahama stated.
President Mahama issued a call for global partnership, saying, “We call upon all nations, within and beyond Africa, to partner with us in shaping a more just and equitable world for the sons and daughters of the motherland.”
The Ghanaian President noted the deep connection between reparations and African identity and dignity.
“Restitution to the African, therefore, is restoration of our full human dignity,” he stated, adding that the movement aims “to speak of history on African terms, of healing deep civilisational wounds and of restoring to African peoples our rightful agency in shaping our past, present and future.”
He underscored the necessity of reparations for African progress and unity, arguing, “We cannot speak of development without identity or speak of unity without acknowledging the erasure that has fractured our heritage.”
President Mahama stressed the importance of a unified African narrative on the global stage and encouraged robust partnerships, particularly with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).
Looking ahead, he announced that Ghana and Togo will co-sponsor a high-level event in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2025 “to further bolster efforts at achieving the justice and closure which has eluded us for centuries.”
“As we do more to correct historical wrongs, we are reasserting our full humanity. We are reaffirming our sovereignty. We are reigniting the flame of dignity that has always burned within the African soul,” assuring the Union of Ghana’s continued support for this agenda towards “The Africa We Want.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/africas-reparations-call-now-a-unified-demand-president-mahama/","14 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:04.312901"

37,"President Mahama submits asset declaration form; calls for transparency and accountability in governance","In a significant move to promote transparency and accountability among public officials, President John Dramani Mahama publicly presented his completed asset declaration forms to the Auditor-General on Tuesday.
This act, in accordance with Article 286 of the 1992 Constitution, highlights President Mahama’s commitment to fighting corruption and ensuring responsible governance.
In his remarks after presenting the forms to the Auditor General, President Mahama stressed the importance of transparency in the asset declaration process.
“Ghana’s Asset Declaration regime and its related activities have often been shrouded in secrecy,” he said, acknowledging the challenges in measuring compliance. He expressed a desire to “inject some openness and transparency into the process by publicising his declaration.”
The President stressed that combating corruption is not only about punishing wrongdoers but also about prevention.
“I have always maintained that while it is all well and good to punish corruption, a more effective way of addressing the canker is preventing it from occurring in the first place,” he remarked. He believes that if the asset declaration process is “properly curated and enforced,” it can serve as a sustainable tool to tackle corruption.
Highlighting the insidious nature of corruption, Mahama declared, “Corruption by nature is insidious and thrives under the cover of darkness. The more light that is shined on it, the more likely that it will be fought successfully.”
“I take the declaration of assets very seriously and expect full compliance from them,” he said.
The president highlighted the necessity of accountability not only for past government officials but also for those currently in power. “Charity, they say, begins at home,” he stated, reinforcing his belief that proactive measures must be taken to address corruption among present public officeholders.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-submits-asset-declaration-form-calls-for-transparency-and-accountability-in-governance/","18 February 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:04.529727"

40,"Mahama hosts Heads of State Dialogue on financing African investments.","President John Dramani Mahama has urged African nations to enhance domestic resource mobilisation to reduce reliance on external funding and to foster sustainable economic growth.
Speaking at a “Heads of State and Government Breakfast Dialogue” during the African Union (AU) Summit, Mahama emphasised the continent’s resilience in the face of ongoing challenges, forecasting a growth recovery of 3.7 per cent in 2024 and 4.03 per cent in 2025.
“This optimistic outlook underscores the robust nature of our economies and the success of our policy interventions,” stated President Mahama, the African Union’s Champion for Financial Institutions. The dialogue was on the theme, “Africa at the Forefront: Mobilizing African Investment and Financing for Implementing Agenda 2063.”
President Mahama hosted the event, organised in partnership with the Alliance of African Multilateral Financing Institutions (AAMFI)— often referred to as the African Club—and gathered esteemed officials from various multilateral organisations.
Notable attendees included Professor Benedict Oramah, Chairperson of the AAMFI and President of Afreximbank; Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO); and Dr Donald Kaberuku, African Union High Representative for Financing of the Union and the Peace Fund.
President Mahama warned of significant hurdles facing the continent despite the encouraging economic forecast. “While we see positive trends, we must acknowledge that our growth hasn’t consistently translated into improved per capita incomes. Structural transformation remains uneven, with many economies reliant on low-productivity sectors,” he noted.
He emphasised the urgency of addressing a challenging financing gap estimated at approximately $402 billion annually until 2030.
“This gap is more than just a figure; it signifies the unrealised aspirations of countless Africans whose hopes for a better future hinge on our capacity to invest wisely in crucial areas like infrastructure, education, technology, and health.”
In addition to financial constraints, Mahama pointed out other challenges, including climate issues, geopolitical tensions, and potential disruptions from diseases and pandemics. He stressed the importance of strategic investments in critical sectors and acknowledged the substantial financing gap needed to support these initiatives.
To bridge this gap, Mahama proposed a multifaceted strategy that encompasses strengthening domestic resource mobilization, improving tax administration, and mitigating illicit financial flows. He underscored the vital role of African multilateral financial institutions in supporting sustainable development and urged strengthening their capacity to advance Africa’s Agenda 2063.
“The establishment of institutions like the African Central Bank, African Investment Bank, African Monetary Fund, and the Pan African Stock Exchange is crucial for fostering necessary investments,” he stated.
“It is imperative for African countries to expedite the rollout of these institutions and leverage our collective strengths to fill the financing and investment voids.”
The president also envisioned a unified, prosperous, and peaceful Africa, affirming that such a vision is attainable if African nations effectively mobilise resources, reform financial systems, and invest in their populations.
Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO’s Director General, echoed President Mahama’s sentiment, urging African leaders to curtail borrowing and seek innovative methods for attracting and retaining investments.
“We need to capitalise on investments flowing into Africa and ensure their sustainability for our development,” she noted, suggesting strategies such as enhancing the value added to natural resources and utilising pension funds to raise long-term capital.
The event also featured a high-level panel discussion focused on strategies for mobilising African finance to meet the objectives of Agenda 2063, reinforcing the dialogue’s commitment to achieving sustainable development across the continent.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-hosts-heads-of-state-dialogue-on-financing-african-investments/","17 February 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:04.726641"

“We’re waiting for the family to meet and tell us what their desires are. But I just want to announce, as President, that we shall give her a state funeral. The family can do the traditional funeral after the state funeral,” President Mahama said.
President Mahama, on behalf of his wife, the government and the people of Ghana, extended heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the Agyeman-Rawlings family.

42,"SPEECH: Launch of the President Accelerated Export Development Advisory Committee.","With a deep sense of duty and national urgency, I welcome you all to this momentous
occasion—the inauguration of the Accelerated Export Development Advisory Committee
(AEDAC).
Today’s inauguration marks a crucial step in our collective commitment to transform Ghana’s economy through competitive exports, inclusive industrialisation, and deliberate integration into regional and global markets.
The Export Challenge: A Call to Action.
Despite its enormous promise, Ghana’s export sector remains hindered by deep-rooted bottlenecks. Nearly 47% of Ghanaian exporters report encountering significant trade obstacles, with non-tariff measures and procedural delays comprising the majority of these challenges.
Over 52% of complaints relate to costly and time-consuming technical regulations imposed by multiple, poorly coordinated agencies. An exporter may need as many as 16 different documents to obtain a Certificate of Origin alone.
The Ghana Standards Authority, tasked with safeguarding quality, is often under-resourced.
At the same time, the absence of accredited local laboratories forces exporters to rely on
foreign testing facilities, raising costs and causing unnecessary delays.
At our ports, overlapping inspections, prolonged clearance times, and unofficial fees pose significant burdens for exporters. According to the International Trade Centre, these inefficiencies cost Ghana up to $4.3 billion in lost export revenue each year.
In our fisheries sector, repeated alerts from the European Union about hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination have led to temporary bans, causing significant reputational damage.
Alarmingly, women and small and medium enterprises—a vital source of innovation and resilience—account for less than 4% of Ghana’s exporting firms. These figures are not just statistics; they represent lost jobs, missed opportunities, and delayed prosperity. We must and will correct this.
Strategic Pathways for Export Transformation.
This is why the AEDAC has been established: to provide a high-level platform for strategic coordination, policy coherence, and institutional accountability in our export development efforts.
Our strategy is both ambitious and deliberate. Under the Accelerated Export Development Programme (AEDAC) and the National Export Development Strategy, we aim to grow Ghana’s non-traditional export earnings from $3.5 billion annually to at least $10 billion by 2030.
To achieve this, we will prioritise value addition and economic diversification. Ghana’s current exports are still dominated by low-complexity raw materials—gold, cocoa, cashew, and timber.
We rank 110th out of 133 countries on the Global Economic Complexity Index. This situation must change. We will support our private sector partners in investing in agro-processing and light manufacturing.
In the textile industry, where 75% of inputs are still imported, we must act decisively to harness the potential of a $6 billion regional market. Ghana has the capacity to significantly boost our garment exports throughout Africa and to the world.
Through targeted incentives and strategic partnerships, we will enhance local production and participation in this value chain.
Our 24-hour Economy Strategy will complement this ambition by developing focused value
chains—cassava, tomato, palm oil, pharmaceuticals, textiles and garments, and industrial
machinery. With effective implementation, we are confident that by 2034, Ghana can reduce
the national unemployment rate from 14.7% to under 5%.
Infrastructure and Trade Facilitation.
No export strategy can succeed without strong logistics and trade infrastructure. Ghana’s exporters encounter some of the highest logistics costs in West Africa, and our export clearance times surpass regional averages.
We will therefore modernise our ports, revamp the Volta Lake Transport Company, develop the Mpakadan port, operationalise the Boankra Inland Port, and expand cold chain infrastructure to support our fisheries and horticultural sectors. These interventions are critical for improving transportation and reducing spoilage, particularly for producers located inland.
We will implement a digitised export processing system, establish transparent border management protocols, and introduce fast-track inspections to enhance efficiency and trust in our trade ecosystem.
Leveraging AfCFTA and Global Opportunities.
The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offers Ghana an unprecedented platform for growth. With access to a market of 1.2 billion people and a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion, Ghana must position itself as a regional hub for manufacturing and exports.
As host of the AfCFTA Secretariat, Ghana must not only participate but also lead. In 2024, we certified 19 companies under the AfCFTA’s Rules of Origin framework. In 2025, we will triple this number and expand readiness training for youth- and women-led businesses to enable them to trade competitively across the continent.
At the same time, we are diversifying our markets beyond Africa—toward Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America—while consolidating our longstanding trade partnerships with Europe and North America. Ghana’s future exports will not only include physical goods but also digital services, creative content, and knowledge-based products.
Human Capital, Technology, and SME Empowerment.
To compete globally, we must equip our people. We will pursue reforms in vocational and
technical education, aligning curricula with the needs of agro-processing, pharmaceuticals,
textile manufacturing, and industrial fabrication.
Through programmes like the 24-Hour Economy, the Adwumawura Programme, the 1 million Youth in Coding and bespoke projects under the Youth Employment Agency (YEA), we will provide Ghanaian youth with relevant skills for modern industry.
Our MSMEs will receive support through technical assistance, expedited certification processes aligned with global standards, and access to digital market platforms. By offering targeted R&D incentives and scale-up grants, we will empower Ghanaian enterprises to integrate into global value chains.
We will also create a predictable and robust incentive regime—including performance-based tax rebates—to drive mass local production and exports of Made-in-Ghana products. Energy reliability will be prioritised through an innovative energy mix strategy—including solar, biogas, natural gas, micro-grid turbines, and embedded industrial solutions. Water infrastructure will be expanded to facilitate year-round industrial productivity and export performance.
A New National Export Compact.
The global trade environment is evolving. Protectionism is on the rise, and competition is intensifying. We must respond with vision, unity, and determination. The AEDAC will collaborate closely with the private sector, development partners, academia, and regional institutions to dismantle barriers, identify new export opportunities, and drive coordinated reform.
Supported by the 24H+ Secretariat, AEDAC will collaborate with GEPA, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and related agencies to ensure Ghana transitions decisively from vision to implementation—from potential to performance.
Conclusion: The Ghana We Envision.
Let us act with purpose and urgency. Let us build a Ghana that earns more than it borrows, a Ghana that processes more than it exports raw materials, a Ghana that creates jobs through competitive exports, not slogans.
To the distinguished members of the Accelerated Export Development Advisory Committee—
thank you for accepting this national responsibility. Your work will help shape Ghana’s future.

May your wisdom guide us.

44,"Mahama unveils landmark Code of Conduct for appointees","President John Dramani Mahama has launched a comprehensive Code of Conduct and Ethics for all political appointees, marking a significant step toward enhanced transparency, accountability, and ethical governance.
The unveiling fulfils a key promise made during the 2024 general election as part of the President’s 120-day Social Contract with the Ghanaian people. The Code of Conduct applies to executive branch officials, including the President, Vice President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, and Presidential Staffers.
“This Code represents a bold declaration of the standards we must uphold as servants of the public,” President Mahama stated during the launch ceremony at the Presidency.
“It is a living and enforceable framework that outlines what is expected of every individual appointed under this administration. This is a government of shared responsibility, and there will be no sacred cows.”
The Code of Conduct is based on core principles intended to promote a new political culture grounded in transparency, humility, and ethical leadership. Key provisions include requirements that all political appointees:
Serve the public with integrity and impartiality
Place the national interest above personal interests
Avoid misuse of office or state resources
Declare and manage any potential conflicts of interest
Eschew opulence and be accountable for the use of public funds
Demonstrate humility in service, measured language, and respect for citizens
The Code of Conduct establishes stringent guidelines to prevent and manage conflicts of interest, mandating disclosure of any situation where personal interests may conflict with official duties. Specific prohibitions include holding stakes in companies that deal with the Government or relevant ministries, using insider knowledge for personal benefit, and awarding contracts to connected entities.
To maintain impartiality and prevent undue influence, the Code prohibits appointees from accepting gifts or favours, particularly from individuals or companies with interests in governmental decisions.
Gifts received during official engagements exceeding GH¢20,000.00 must be declared and surrendered upon leaving office unless otherwise permitted by the President. Purchasing and distributing hampers using government funds is generally prohibited, with limited exceptions for modest staff recognition.
All official and unofficial international travel undertaken by Ministers requires the prior approval of the Chief of Staff’s office. A report and retirement of impressed funds are due within 14 days of return.
President Mahama emphasised the importance of asset declaration, noting that appointees who failed to meet the March 31, 2025, deadline will forfeit three months of salary to the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (Mahama Cares).
Additionally, non-compliant appointees will be required to donate an additional one month’s salary, for a total donation of four months’ salary, to the Mahama Cares Trust Fund. “However, if by the close of Wednesday, 7th of May 2025, any of you still fail to declare your assets, count yourself as automatically dismissed.”
“Strict compliance with this code will restore confidence in the political elite and help to consolidate our democracy,” President Mahama concluded. “Let us walk this path together with discipline, humility, and an unyielding commitment to the people of Ghana.”
Demonstrating his commitment to the principles outlined in the Code, President Mahama, represented by Presidential Spokesperson and Minister of State for Government Communications Felix Kwakye Ofosu, presented two vehicles donated by a car company to Chief of Staff Julius Debrah, to be added to the Government vehicle pool.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-unveils-landmark-code-of-conduct-for-appointees/","06 May 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:04.983605"

48,"Accra Reset: Speech by H.E. President Olusegun Obasanjo at the G20 Leaders’ Summit, Johannesburg, South Africa.","Your Excellencies,
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,
I am here for the Accra Reset, a global South-anchored platform.
Allow me to begin by conveying special greetings from H.E. John Dramani Mahama, President of the Republic of Ghana, and African Union Champion for Reparations, the African Union’s continental theme for this year. He is also spearheading Accra Reset. President Mahama extends his deep appreciation to H.E. President Cyril Ramaphosa, whose leadership has guided this G20 cycle with clarity, courage, and profound commitment to justice.
Congratulations are due to South Africa and the African Union for their exceptional representation of the aspirations of Africa, Global Africa, and the wider Global South. This Johannesburg Summit has been defined by integrity of purpose, a clear focus on structural reform, and an unwavering commitment to ensure that the G20 delivers progress for all peoples and not just a privileged few.
We also acknowledge several important highlights of this year’s Presidency:
– the advancement of a more equitable global financial architecture;
– the strong emphasis on global health resilience and manufacturing sovereignty;
– the renewed momentum around digital public infrastructure and fair technology partnerships;
– the focus on inclusive growth and decent jobs; and
– the widening of Global South participation in multilateral decision-making.
Your Excellencies, these priorities resonate profoundly with the mission that several of your governments helped shape over the last three years. I speak of the Accra Reset, a Global South–anchored ambition to transform development cooperation into a system that is country-led, regionally empowered, and globally coherent.|
Today, on this historic platform, we humbly request continued cooperation between the G20, the South African Presidency, the African Union, and the Accra Reset.
We are pleased to announce that, as of this month:
– the interim Secretariat of the Accra Reset has formally commenced operations in Ghana;
– the Circle of Leaders has expanded to include more than two dozen former Heads of State and Heads of International Organisations from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the Caribbean;
– a High-Level Panel is being convened to prepare a landmark report on restructuring global governance, to be submitted to a commissioning authority composed of Heads of State from across both the Global North and Global South.
These developments speak to a simple truth: we are entering a moment in world affairs when durable solutions must be co-created, not imposed; negotiated with fairness, not inherited from history; and built on sovereignty, dignity, common security and shared prosperity.
The Accra Reset stands ready to work closely with the G20. It is poised to serve as the connective tissue interlinking the public, private, and civil factions of Global South societies. It aims to work through the African Union and the South African Presidency to advance ongoing G20-enabled reforms in health governance, digital cooperation, development finance, investments with guarantees and assurance for investor, jobs for youth, wealth creation and resilient supply chains.
Our history of AID and loans has created an economy of dependency. To move forward, we must re-architect our economies based on trade and investment. We see this cooperation not as a parallel track, but as a strategic reinforcement of the agenda in finance and financial architecture championed in Leaders Declaration of 2025 G20 Summit in South Africa, mindful of inadequacy of AID which is drying up and borrowing which has become counterproductive for human capital development in Global Africa.
Your Excellencies,
On behalf of the interim Presidential Council, the Circle of Leaders, and the global coalition behind the Accra Reset, I express profound gratitude to President Ramaphosa, and all G20 members for the opportunity to mark the beginning of a new partnership between the G20 and the Accra Reset.
We stand ready to work, and to do so with humility, discipline, and unwavering resolve, to help shape a workable multilateral order for finance for development and for investment for this generation and the next. Through our collective efforts, we shall transition the international development system from endless aspirational targets to workable business models that drive real and durable change and collaboration for mutual interest.

The suspension has left a shortfall estimated at $156 million, with critical health and social intervention programmes at risk of disruption.
In a statement released by Felix Kwakye Ofosu, Spokesperson to the President and Minister for Government Communications, President Mahama expressed deep concern over the potential impact of the funding gap.
Of particular concern is the projected $78.2 million shortfall that threatens essential programmes in malaria prevention, maternal and child health, family planning, reproductive health, nutrition, and the fight against HIV/AIDS.
The President emphasised that the suspension of USAID funding could severely affect the availability of antiretroviral drugs, HIV testing, and prevention programmes, as well as other critical health interventions.
To mitigate these challenges, President Mahama has instructed the Finance Minister to prioritise bridging arrangements for these key areas to ensure continuity in service delivery and safeguard public health outcomes.
“The President is deeply committed to protecting the gains made in these critical sectors and has directed that urgent steps be taken to address the funding gap,” the statement read.
The government is expected to explore alternative funding mechanisms and reallocate resources to prevent any disruption in these vital programmes. The suspension of USAID funding comes at a time when Ghana is intensifying efforts to combat malaria, reduce maternal and child mortality, and strengthen its HIV/AIDS response.
The government’s swift action to bridge the gap underscores its commitment to maintaining progress in these areas and ensuring that vulnerable populations continue to receive essential services.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-directs-urgent-action-to-bridge-usaid-funding-gap/","11 February 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:05.429647"
50,"First Lady Lordina Mahama Urges Global Unity for Child Protection at UN General Assembly Prayer Service","First Lady Mrs Lordina Dramani Mahama has appealed for concerted global action to safeguard the future of children, calling for a peaceful world with opportunities for their growth and well-being.
Her impassioned plea was at a special annual prayer session for children at the Tillman Chapel Church Centre in New York, on the sidelines of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly.
Mrs Mahama highlighted the uncertainties faced by children today, exacerbated by scaled-back funding for essential services, growing mistrust in institutions, and an erosion of hope.
She noted that while the challenges, especially for the vulnerable, are immense, they can be overcome through collective prayer and an unwavering commitment to confront the rapidly changing global order.
“We gather here from different nations and cultures, but we are united by our shared faith,” she stated, adding that, through prayer and decisive leadership, “we can create a world where every child is protected and empowered to achieve their full potential.”
Mrs Mahama painted a stark picture of the thousands of children caught in armed conflicts and humanitarian crises, particularly in Africa, where their childhoods are brutally stolen.
“These are precious lives destroyed by circumstances beyond their control,” she lamented. “When nations fail to focus on policies that safeguard the home, strengthen communities, and nurture the youth, it is our children who suffer the most. They are the ones who lose parents, siblings, homes, dreams, and carry emotional scars that can last forever.”
The First Lady mentioned her personal commitment to these ideals through the work of the Lordina Foundation, her non-governmental organisation dedicated to the welfare of underprivileged children and orphans in Ghana.
Mrs Mahama expressed hope that with broader support, such philanthropic efforts across the globe could profoundly impact the lives of countless children.
In her prayer for the world’s children, the First Lady said: “Heavenly Father, I lift the needy and orphaned children in Ghana and across the world into your loving care. I ask that you surround them with protection, comfort, and hope for a brighter future. Provide for their daily needs, including food, shelter, clothing, and education. Bless those who dedicate their time and resources to care for them. May these children grow in wisdom, strength, and joy, knowing that you love them. Guide their paths with opportunities, surround them with kindness, and let their lives shine as testimonies of your unfailing grace and provision. Amen.”
The annual prayer service, a crucial platform for advocacy, was facilitated by World Vision International in partnership with the World Council of Churches, Caritas Internationalis, the Episcopal Church, and other leading faith-based organisations.","https://presidency.gov.gh/first-lady-lordina-mahama-urges-global-unity-for-child-protection-at-un-general-assembly-prayer-service/","22 September 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:05.488810"

Mr Mahama noted that the visit underscored the enduring friendship between the two nations, built upon a foundation laid by their founding fathers, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah and President Keita.
The visit continues President Mahama’s efforts to engage with neighbouring countries and strengthen Ghana’s policy of good neighbourliness. He was received at the airport by the Malian leader, General Assimi Goita, before their meetings in the Presidential Palace. From Mali, Mr Mahama will continue to Niger and Burkina Faso.
Speaking to the press after a closed-door meeting with Malian Transition President General Assimi Goita, Mr Mahama emphasised the historic ties between Ghana and Mali.
“Everybody knows the historic relations that have existed between Ghana and Mali since the period of our ex-presidents, Keita and Dr. Kwame Nkrumah… and so I came on a friendly visit, and also to thank President Goita for allowing Prime Minister Maiga to visit Ghana when I was being inaugurated as president.”
Mr. Mahama underscored the importance of transit trade and the deep cultural ties that bind the two nations, reiterating Ghana’s dedication to promoting economic growth across the subregion. Discussions also focused on reviving the Permanent Joint Commission for Cooperation which was stalled in 2011, to address existing trade and diplomatic bottlenecks.
Recognising the growing threat of insurgency and terrorism in West Africa, President Mahama engaged in crucial discussions regarding enhanced security cooperation, particularly with the Alliance of Sahel States (AES). He stressed the importance of strengthening ties to advance Africa’s sovereignty and find collaborative solutions to these pressing regional challenges.
Addressing the complex relationship between the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Sahel states (Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger), President Mahama expressed his belief that despite their departure from ECOWAS, the friendship and brotherly love between the people should continue. He advocated for continued dialogue and reconciliation between the Sahel states and the regional bloc.
Before the bilateral talks, Mr. Mahama stopped along the road in front of his hotel to acknowledge greetings from the Ghanaian community in Bamako, demonstrating his commitment to the well-being of Ghanaian citizens abroad.
The day ended with a visit to the historic statue of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, located in the heart of Bamako.

President Mahama acknowledged Ghana’s central role in Japan’s cocoa supply, noting that Ghana accounts for about 70% of Japan’s cocoa imports.
He encouraged Japanese firms to expand investments in Ghana’s cocoa value chain, including a public–private partnership with the Cocoa Processing Company to revamp the plant and boost value addition.
The President also highlighted upcoming milestones in Ghana–Japan relations, including the centenary of Dr. Hideyo Noguchi’s arrival in Ghana and the 50th anniversary of the Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV) in 2027—anniversaries he previously discussed with H.E. Hiroshi Yoshimoto, Japan’s Ambassador to Ghana.
On infrastructure, President Mahama stressed the strategic importance of the Volivo Bridge over the Volta River, a critical component of Ghana’s Eastern Corridor that links Accra and Tema to the north and onward to Burkina Faso and Niger.
He emphasised the bridge’s role in moving agricultural produce such as yams and maize from northern Ghana to markets in the south.
Mr Mahama also expressed appreciation to the Government of Japan for the JPY 11.239 billion loan signed on 5 December 2016 for the project and reaffirmed Ghana’s request for additional support—especially grants—to close the remaining 64% procurement gap.
Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba welcomed closer collaboration with Ghana to expand infrastructure development and recalled the long-standing partnership that helped establish the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research.
He acknowledged that Japanese chocolate lovers depend largely on Ghanaian cocoa.
Reiterating Japan’s commitment to Ghana’s development priorities, the Prime Minister gave an assurance that Tokyo would work to expedite solutions to funding gaps to ensure the successful completion of key projects.
He also sought Ghana’s support for Japan’s candidate, Masahiko Metoki, for the position of Director General of the Universal Postal Union’s International Bureau and Ghana’s backing for Japan’s positions on reforms to make the United Nations Security Council more democratic.

59,"President Mahama meets Alex Soros of the Open Society Foundations.","President John Dramani Mahama held a highly productive meeting on Friday with Mr. Alex Soros, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Open Society Foundations (OSF).
The discussion centred on Ghana’s notable progress in economic recovery, democratic governance, and regional stability.
President Mahama took the opportunity to brief Mr. Soros on the key policy measures driving Ghana’s economic revival and the notable progress being made.
He elaborated on the government’s ‘Reset Agenda’ aimed at fostering a positive national mindset, ongoing efforts to strengthen accountability institutions, and recent developments within the ECOWAS sub-region.
Ghana: A Beacon of Democracy.
President Mahama reiterated Ghana’s unwavering commitment to upholding the values of democracy, respect for human rights, and the fundamental freedoms of its citizenry.
He noted Ghana’s stellar reputation for democratic governance, marked by peaceful transitions under its 33-year-old Fourth Republican Constitution.
“We’ve had nine elections, all of which have been successful. And we’ve experienced several peaceful changes of government from one party to another, all of which have occurred smoothly.”
On the economic front, President Mahama stated that Ghana’s economy is recovering rapidly, a direct result of bold fiscal and monetary policies underpinned by robust governance principles. He noted the appreciation of the Ghana Cedi by approximately 42% and a sharp decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, with the government targeting single-digit inflation in the coming months.
The President acknowledged that investor confidence had waned in the past due to governance challenges and weakened institutions. However, he reassured Mr. Soros that his administration is committed to non-interference in corruption-related cases and has instituted strict disciplinary measures for all appointees.
“There was a lot of corruption and a lack of accountability. So, we came in with a comprehensive programme to strengthen anti-corruption institutions,” President Mahama explained, referencing the “Operation Recover All the Loot (ORAL),” a major initiative to recover state assets.
“You will continue to hear of prosecutions and other measures against individuals who have mismanaged public resources, as we steadfastly pursue accountability.”
Addressing the delicate relations with the three Sahelian countries – Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger – President Mahama assured Mr. Soros of positive progress in ongoing efforts to reunite the sub-region. He referred to visits to the three countries to establish channels for continuous communication and dialogue.
“We held an ECOWAS meeting barely three weeks ago, and happily, the whole mood has changed. There is now a clear appetite for rapprochement between ECOWAS and the three countries,” he said.
“Discussions are ongoing between the ECOWAS Secretariat and these nations. In the meantime, we all agreed to prioritise the free movement of people and goods across our borders and encourage transit trade.”
On his part, Mr. Alex Soros congratulated President Mahama on his re-election victory and commended his leadership. He explained that his visit to Ghana was part of activities marking the 50th anniversary of ECOWAS.
He noted that the Open Society Foundations in Africa have historically championed ECOWAS integration, celebrating significant achievements such as visa-free travel.
Mr. Soros, an investor and philanthropist, expressed his foundation’s interest in exploring partnerships and providing support for further regional integration efforts. Besides chairing the OSF Board, he also sits on the investment committee for the Soros Fund Management.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-meets-alex-soros-of-the-open-society-foundations/","18 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:06.061013"

The president has set aside the day to unite Ghanaians of all faiths and express gratitude to God for the nation’s abundant blessings. The President declared that when he inaugurated a committee to plan the National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving. The Committee is chaired by former Minister Elvis Afriyie Ankrah, with Prophet Dr Akwasi Agyemang Prempeh as the Coordinator.
The committee members are drawn from the various Christian and Islamic denominations and councils.
In his remarks, the president said, “Today I address you not only as your President but as a fellow Ghanaian, grateful to the Almighty God for his continued mercy upon our land and our people.”
“We’ve gathered here today as a nation united by faith, hope, and a shared destiny to inaugurate a sacred initiative that reflects the soul of our nation.
“In an era marked by division, disaster, and despair, Ghana remains, by the grace of God, an oasis of peace, stability, and spiritual unity. This peace is not accidental; it is the result of committed leadership, communal resilience, and, above all, the steadfast prayers and supplications of a faithful nation.”
The President, who interwove his speech with quotations from both the Bible and the Quran, said: “Let this be a legacy, a sacred pause in our national calendar that generations to come will celebrate. A day when Ghana does not cry out in fear but rejoices in faith. May God bless the work of the National Prayer and Thanksgiving Committee.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/national-day-of-prayer-fixed-on-july-1st/","25 April 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:06.122373"

Outlining the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the missions, the President said the framework would ensure accountability and clear outcomes.
“I will monitor progress under this framework as part of our commitment to results‑oriented diplomacy,” he said. “These KPIs are not mere bureaucratic tools; they are instruments to ensure that every action our missions take contributes directly to advancing Ghana’s national priorities.”
He reminded the ambassadors and high commissioners that the Public Financial Management Act and all relevant regulations must guide their stewardship of public resources.
“Guard the public purse with diligence and ensure that efficiency, service, and ethical governance, which are the very values we are entrenching at home, shine through in every mission abroad,” he added.
President Mahama decried the more than $15 million Ghana spends annually on renting diplomatic properties abroad. According to him, it is not a judicious use of taxpayers’ resources and requires an immediate reversal.
He announced Cabinet’s approval of the STRIDE initiative under which the country will develop its own properties.

62,"SPEECH: President’s keynote to open the 8th Africa-Singapore Business Forum.","Excellencies,
Distinguished ministers,
Captains of industry,
Chairman of Enterprise Singapore,
Minister Grace,
Friends of Africa and Asia,
Good morning. It is a privilege to open my State Visit to Singapore here at the 8th Africa‑Singapore Business Forum.
This is my very first engagement in Singapore over the next three days, and there could be no better place to start than in the company of the builders of prosperity—our entrepreneurs, investors, innovators and policymakers who turn ideas into jobs and growth.
I thank Minister Grace for her warm welcome and insightful remarks, and I appreciate the leadership of the Chairman and the entire team at Enterprise Singapore in bringing together this platform.
Over the next three days, I look forward to constructive meetings with Prime Minister Wong and President Tharman, I look forward to instructive industry roundtables and site visits, and to deepening our understanding of Singapore’s remarkable journey—your excellence in logistics and ports, your discipline in public administration, your remarkable devotion to a sustainable environment, and your success in cultivating skills and innovation.
We are here to learn, to partner, and to deliver.
The theme—Bridging Capabilities, Charting Sustainable Growth—speaks to a partnership that is both urgent and full of promise. We live in a rapidly changing world. The post-Cold War world ushered in the era of globalisation.
It sparked much excitement about the endless possibilities open to mankind to create prosperity for most of the world’s population. The cheers and backslapping that celebrated the MDGs, which pulled 1 billion of the world’s people out of poverty, are becoming just a pleasant memory of the past.
The death knell of multilateralism is sounding. Global relations are becoming more transactional. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs are flying fast and furious. The effects on the global economy are still to be well understood.
In these unpredictable times, we must forge new alliances and open new opportunities and possibilities. We must explore new markets and new investment spaces.
In a world of tightened financial conditions, fragile supply chains and rising protectionism, South–South collaboration is not optional; it is essential. Africa and Singapore must be champions of open markets, trusted rules and practical partnerships that deliver jobs, technology transfer and shared prosperity.
Africa and Asia are the two youngest, fastest‑urbanising regions in the world. We are complementary in resources, markets and know‑how. And the numbers tell a clear story: Africa‑Singapore trade rose by about 50 per cent between 2020 and 2024 to nearly US$14 billion, with West Africa accounting for more than half of that.
Ghana‑Singapore trade has also grown, reaching over US$215 million in 2024.
I speak today as an African leader and as President of Ghana. Our message is simple: Africa is investable, and Ghana is your reliable gateway to the continent. The continent is the world’s most dynamic emerging market.
We are 1.4 billion people today—young, fast-urbanising, digitally connected—and by 2030, Africa’s cities will host more than 700 million consumers.
The African Continental Free Trade Area is the largest new free trade area in the world by number of countries, and this has created a $3.4 trillion market and lowered barriers across supply chains.
Africa holds vast renewable energy potential and is already a global leader in mobile money and fintech adoption. This is a market ready for scaled solutions. Yet this opportunity must be matched with capital at the right price and with the right instruments.
As the African Union Champion on Financial Institutions, I must be candid: the current global financial architecture remains inequitable for low- and middle-income countries.
Africa faces an annual financing gap estimated at $1.3 trillion. Infrastructure needs alone run between $181 and $221 billion per year through 2030, and the climate finance gap is about $213 billion annually.
We are taking steps to build an African financial system that works for Africa; accelerate the African Monetary Institute as a precursor to the African Central Bank, and link ten (10) major stock exchanges through the African Exchanges Linkage Project to enhance liquidity.
We are also scaling the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System to enable businesses to settle cross-border trade in local currencies. This is where Singapore’s strengths can be catalytic.
Singapore stands at the nexus of global finance, fintech, logistics and green innovation.
Your excellence in project preparation, blended finance, risk management, standards and dispute resolution is precisely what African projects need to move from pipeline to bankable to build.
As host of the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, Ghana sits at the heart of the US$3.4 trillion single market. Through ECOWAS, we connect you to more than 400 million consumers in West Africa.
We offer political stability, a rules‑based environment, a double taxation agreement with Singapore in force since 2019, and a growing base of Singaporean investors—69 companies registered with cumulative investments exceeding US$2 billion.
Ghana is, therefore, a trusted entry point to scale across the continent. We know credibility is earned. We are pursuing a deliberate national reset: stabilising the macroeconomy, restoring confidence and reforming how we do business.
Inflation is easing, the cedi has stabilised, and ratings outlooks are improving.
We are simplifying regulations through our Business Regulatory Reforms, and we are reviewing our Investment Promotion Act—including the removal of minimum capital thresholds for foreign investors—to make it easier and faster to partner, whether through joint ventures or wholly‑owned investments.
The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre now provides sector‑specific, region‑by‑region opportunity maps to help investors make decisions based on credible data.
Our economic strategy is anchored in productivity, exports and jobs. We call it the 24‑Hour Economy—for a reason. Ghana is OPEN FOR BUSINESS 24 hours a day.
We are aligning infrastructure, incentives, and skills so factories, farms, ports, and service centres can operate round-the-clock shifts safely and competitively. At the core of this is the Volta Economic Corridor—our most ambitious integrated development to date.
The Volta Corridor has four pillars:
Grow24: irrigating more than two million hectares for year‑round farming.
Make24: agro‑industrial parks for textiles, pharmaceuticals and food processing.
Show24: tourism and hospitality along one of the world’s great inland lakes.
Connect24: transforming Lake Volta into a cost‑efficient inland transport spine, reducing logistics costs and linking farms, factories and markets.
We are complementing this with catalytic projects—the Legon Pharmaceutical Innovation Park, the Kumasi Machinery and Technology Park, the Akosombo‑Juapong Garments and Textiles Park, Digital TVET Centres of Excellence, and renewable energy corridors.
Our Big Push Infrastructure programme will accelerate roads, power and digital connectivity to crowd‑in private capital and unlock scale.
Singapore’s strengths align perfectly with Africa’s and Ghana’s priorities.
Allow me to propose five practical pillars where we can bridge capabilities and chart shared growth:
1. Efficient, green supply chains: Partner with Ghana to modernise ports, inland waterways and cold chains. Your world‑class logistics and standards can reduce Africa’s trade costs and unlock export competitiveness.
2. Agribusiness and food systems: From precision irrigation to processing and packaging, Singaporean tecnology and African scale can turn our farms into reliable suppliers for Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
3. Clean energy and carbon markets: Ghana and Singapore signed an Article 6 Implementation Agreement in 2024. We have established a Carbon Markets Office and Ghana Carbon Registry, anchored in new environmental legislation, to ensure transparency and alignment with international standards. Invest with us in renewable energy, waste‑to‑energy, regenerative agriculture and forestry. Generate high‑integrity credits while delivering jobs, clean air and resilience.
4. Digital economy and services: Build with us on e‑payments, cybersecurity, digital ID and smart government. Create BPO and shared‑service hubs to serve Africa from Accra, 24/7.
5. Advanced manufacturing and critical minerals: Ghana has strong manganese output and significant lithium potential, alongside graphite, gold, copper and rare earth prospects. Our policy is value addition at home—battery precursors, components and downstream manufacturing—powered by clean energy and world‑class standards.
Enterprise Singapore has been an outstanding partner in building these bridges, helping Ghanaian firms access Asian markets and enabling Singaporean champions to succeed in Ghana.
We deeply appreciate this.
Together, we can scale what works—project preparation, blended finance, guarantee instruments, and SME matchmaking—so that more deals move from MoUs to operations.
To the business leaders in this room, I want to extend a special invitation. On day three of this State Visit, as part of the Africa Forum, we will host a Presidential Business Roundtable.
Join us. Bring your teams. Put Ghana’s readiness to the test. We will showcase bankable projects, provide direct access to our regulators, outline incentives for strategic investors and offer a one‑stop investor concierge so decisions can be made quickly and confidently.
Our proposition is straightforward:
– A stable, reform‑minded country, connected to the AfCFTA, designed for scale.
– A 24‑Hour Economy that matches your need for speed, reliability and standards.
– A pipeline of investable projects in agribusiness, logistics, manufacturing, energy, digital and tourism.
– A partner that values integrity, predictability and long‑term relationships.

65,"AccountabilitySeries: Interior Minister Announces Transformative Initiatives.","The Ministry for the Interior has unveiled groundbreaking initiatives aimed at reforming the Prison Service and strengthening the nation’s security architecture.
Speaking at the inaugural “Government Accountability Series” at the Presidency in Accra, Minister for the Interior, Alhaji Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, announced a pivotal shift for the Prison Service, transforming it into a key contributor to national production and inmate rehabilitation.
As part of the government’s strategic efforts to resource state institutions and foster meaningful rehabilitation, the Ministry for the Interior has initiated discussions with the Ministry of Education to sign a Memorandum of Understanding. This landmark agreement will empower the Prison Service to supply:
– 20% of sanitary pads for the nation’s Free Sanitary Initiative.
– 30% of all school furniture procured by the government.
– 30% of all school uniforms distributed nationwide.
Alhaji Mohammed-Mubarak, articulating the rationale behind the initiative, stated that the initiative is designed to engender reforms within the nation’s prisons, where inmates are mostly caged.
“We are moving beyond mere incarceration to equip inmates with valuable skills, foster productivity, and prepare them for successful reintegration into society.
The Minister stated that the Ghana Police Service plays a critical role in upholding public order and supporting the government’s economic agenda.
He lauded the Service’s unwavering commitment to public safety, highlighting its sustained efforts against illegal mining operations.
These robust efforts have significantly curbed illicit activities in forest reserves and along water bodies, effectively preventing foreign nationals from engaging in small-scale mining and safeguarding the nation’s natural resources.
In response to the government’s 24-Hour Economy programme, Mohammed-Mubarak announced the establishment of a dedicated 24-Hour Economy Secretariat at the Police Headquarters in Accra. This secretariat is designed to provide round-the-clock security for businesses, ensuring the safe movement of goods and people, and fostering unhindered economic growth across the country.

68,"‘Free Tertiary Education for PwDs– an act of justice and equality’ – President Mahama","President John Dramani Mahama, speaking at the launch of the Free Tertiary Education for Persons with Disability on Friday, described the policy as a moral responsibility rather than an act of charity.
“Each student supported under this policy becomes an asset to our nation. A potential engineer, a teacher, an entrepreneur, a farmer or an innovator. Their success will strengthen Ghana’s economy and enrich our collective humanity,” President Mahama said.
He added that the policy, which aims to provide equal access to higher education, particularly for persons with disabilities, is a strategic investment in Ghana’s most valuable resource: its people.
Mr Mahama noted that it was a reminder that a nation’s soul is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.
“Today, we gather to mark a new and defining moment in Ghana’s journey towards inclusion and equality.”
Quoting former South African President Nelson Mandela, President Mahama said: “A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens but its lowest ones.”
President Mahama said that according to the 2021 Population and Housing Census, there are more than two million Ghanaians living with disabilities. However, behind this statistic, behind this figure, are real human stories, he said.
“Stories of perseverance, of talent waiting to be nurtured and of dreams that deserve to be fulfilled. Too many still face barriers of poverty, of stigma, of lack of access to education and livelihood opportunities,” he added.
He rallied all stakeholders, including corporate Ghana, to make a conscious effort to promote inclusion across the board.
“Our collective task, therefore, is to ensure that no Ghanaian is denied the chance to learn, to work and to serve because of disability. Ghana has not been idle in this effort.”
President Mahama noted that in 2015, his government introduced the Inclusive Education Policy, which opened mainstream schools to learners with disabilities and began transforming the country’s educational culture.
“Today, we are advancing that vision one bold step further. The Free Tertiary Education for Persons with Disabilities Initiative fulfils a pledge I made to the people of Ghana to make higher education accessible to all, regardless of financial condition or circumstances,” the President said.
The President explained that the implementation will be led by the revamped Student Loan Trust Fund, which has now been modernised and digitised to ensure transparency, efficiency, and sustainability.
He further disclosed that the Scholarship Secretariat has previously administered a limited scholarship for persons with disabilities. With the launch of the Free Tertiary Education for Persons with Disabilities, the scholarship package will be integrated into the new universal disability scholarship under the Student Loan Trust Fund.
The Minister for Education, Haruna Iddrisu (MP), announced that, under President Mahama’s directive, GETFUND shall make an annual contribution of GHS 50 million in support of the Student Loan Trust Fund and the no-fees-stress policy.","https://presidency.gov.gh/free-tertiary-education-for-an-act-of-justice-and-equality-president-mahama/","25 October 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:06.647235"

The President expressed this commendation during a courtesy call from a delegation of Chiefs from Mamprugu, led by Naba Baba Salifu Atamale Alemyaruun, the Paramount Chief of Bongo, at the Presidency on Thursday.
The delegation conveyed the Naa-Yiri’s congratulations to President Mahama on his emphatic victory in the 2024 general election.
Addressing the delegation, President Mahama expressed his profound concern about the devastating impact of the conflict on Bawku, which was once a thriving commercial hub.
“Bawku, which has always been a booming and prosperous commercial centre, is now a pale shadow of itself. Nobody is happy about this situation,” he stated.
He highlighted the alarming security situation, noting that “some youth in Bawku periodically move around on motorcycles with sophisticated assault rifles and firing indiscriminately,” posing a grave challenge to national peace and regional harmony.
This instability, he added, has affected all ethnic groups—Mamprusis, Kusasis, Bisas, Mossis, Hausas, and others—forcing professionals to flee and public service workers to refuse postings to the area.
President Mahama specifically praised the dignified and statesmanlike approach of both traditional leaders in their pursuit of peace.
“Your Royal Majesty, I cannot speak of peace and development in the North without touching on the situation in Bawku,” the President emphasised, addressing the Naa-Yiri through his delegation.
“Let me commend Your Royal Majesty for the dignified and statesmanlike manner in which you have responded to these tensions. Your calm and reasonable voice has been a source of guidance to many, and I sincerely appreciate your commitment to peace.”
“I commend you for the concessions you are willing to make in order to see lasting peace in Bawku,” he remarked, urging all stakeholders to “speed up the mediation process so that peace can return to Bawku so that residents can return to their normal lives as soon as possible.”
The President reiterated the government’s unwavering commitment to exploring all possible means to protect lives and property in Bawku. This includes enhancing security presence, bolstering conflict resolution mechanisms, and fostering deeper dialogue with all traditional, religious, and civic stakeholders.
“We believe that peace in Bawku is a matter of national importance and that it requires our collective resolve so that justice will prevail and that we will resolve issues by dialogue,” he affirmed.
President Mahama described the Mamprugu Kingdom as a pillar of stability, tradition, and national conscience. He acknowledged the Naa-Yiri’s visionary leadership as an inspiration to his people and the nation, pledging the government’s readiness to work collaboratively to realise Mamprugu’s full development potential through enhanced infrastructure in education, health care, agriculture, roads, bridges, and job creation.
“Let us build a future of peace, dignity, and shared prosperity for all,” President Mahama concluded.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-commends-otumfuo-and-naa-yiris-crucial-mediation-efforts-in-bawku-conflict-resolution/","18 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:06.768900"

The President gave the assurance during a courtesy call by the PIAC members. Led by its Chairman, Mr Constantine K.M. Kudzedzi, the Committee members visited to congratulate the President on his recent election victory and discuss matters concerning the management of Ghana’s oil revenues.
President Mahama outlined his government’s ambitious plan to invest $10 billion over the next five years, allocating $2 billion annually, into priority infrastructure projects across the country.
These projects will target key sectors, including roads, major bridges, education, and health infrastructure, as well as areas vital for boosting productivity in the agriculture sector.
He specified that agricultural projects under the “Big Push” would encompass irrigation schemes, construction of farmer service centres, and support for agribusiness development.
The President stated that the primary sources of funding for this significant policy initiative would be petroleum revenue and minerals royalties.
Commending PIAC for its vital role, President Mahama praised the Committee’s efforts in monitoring and ensuring transparency and accountability in the utilisation of Ghana’s petroleum revenues.
He highlighted PIAC as a commendable model for other countries seeking effective oversight mechanisms.

The President, speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony for the reconstruction of the Wenchi-Sawla-Wa highway, said the first set of roads selected are the most important at risk across all regions, and the immediate objective is to connect regional and district capitals and other key corridors.
“We are here to cut sod to cover three regions, Bono East, Savannah, and Upper West regions. Today’s sod cutting marks the commencement of reconstruction for the road from Wenchi to Wa. It will be a new road, very well constructed as an international route to the landlocked countries in Burkina Faso and Mali,” the President said.
This sod cutting, he added, “also marks the beginning of a rehabilitation of the Fufolsu – Sawla Road, which was funded under my past administration with a loan from the African Development Bank.”
The President explained, “The Wenchi-Wa Road is not an ordinary route. It is part of what we call the National Route N12, and it extends from Wenchi in the Bono region, passes through Bamboi, through Bandan Nkwanta and Tinga, to Sawla, to Tuna and eventually to Wa in the Upper West Region.”
This, he said, will open a new corridor of progress to reconnect regions, markets, and families, renewing the promise of inclusive development and affirming that every part of Ghana deserves modern infrastructure, dignity, and opportunity.
The project covers 195 kilometres and is divided into seven lots to facilitate concurrent execution for completion within two years.
“We expect compliance with the highest technical standards, environmental protection and transparent oversight by the Ghana Highway Authority and the Ministry of Roads and Highways”, he cautioned.
It is estimated that between 2,000 and 2,500 vehicles pass through the Wenchi-Sawla-Wa corridor, now under construction, carrying nearly 4,000 tons of grain, yams, cashews, and livestock from the middle belts to the north.
“This road handles a significant volume of Ghana’s agri-freight traffic”, – the President emphasised, explaining that it remains a vital support to the country’s grain and livestock economy, connecting rich farmlands of the Bono East Region to the Sahel trade routes via Hamile on Ghana’s Northern border.
“The whole of Ghana is going to be a construction site for the next two years, accept the inconvenience”, the President added.
The Minister for Roads and Highways, Kwame Governs Agbodza, assured contractors that, under the Big Push Agenda, there would be no delay in payments for work done.

74,"President Mahama swears in 37 High Court Judges, calls for swift justice and ethical excellence","President John Dramani Mahama on Thursday reinforced his administration’s commitment to an independent yet accountable judiciary at the induction of 37 new High Court judges.
“Judicial independence is the lifeblood of our democracy, and it must never be compromised,” President Mahama declared during the swearing-in ceremony. “But independence does not mean isolation. Courts must remain open to accountability, must be guided by transparency and fidelity to the Constitution of the Republic.”
The President said the judiciary plays a critical role in Ghana’s development aspirations, particularly as the government pursues its Resetting Ghana Agenda, including the 24-Hour Economy initiative and the Big Push infrastructure programme.
“Your judgments will shape not only our jurisprudence, but also affect investor confidence, human rights, and our national stability,” he told the new judges, stressing that Ghana needs “a judiciary that is both firm and facilitative, one that enforces contracts fairly, protects innovation, and delivers justice without undue delay.”
President Mahama reminded the judges that their work extends beyond legal documents to the lives of real people.
“Behind every written affidavit was a human story of loss of hope, of survival, a dismissed teacher, a family displaced, a young person wrongfully accused,” he noted.
He urged the newly sworn-in judges to reject unnecessary delays and embrace modernisation.
“For as the saying goes, when lawyers play with time, justice becomes a casualty. Let the High Court be both the temple of the law and the house of humanity.”
Reaffirming executive support for the judiciary, the President stated: “As President, I wish to reaffirm my government’s unwavering commitment to defending judicial independence. Yet with that freedom comes the sacred duty to uphold ethical discipline and professional excellence.”
Responding on behalf of his colleagues, Justice Francis Asong Obuojo expressed gratitude for the appointment and pledged impartial service.
“We are here to assure you, the President, that for the confidence imposed in us and for this appointment, we will deliver justice to the people and the citizenry,” he said, committing to uphold justice “with integrity and without partiality.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-swears-in-37-high-court-judges-calls-for-swift-justice-and-ethical-excellence/","24 October 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:07.024729"

Following the ceremonial reception, President Mahama and King Mswati III engaged in bilateral talks in the Credentials Hall, culminating in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish a Permanent Joint Commission for Cooperation. The agreement will provide a formal framework for enhancing cooperation across various sectors.
In his remarks, President Mahama welcomed the Eswatini delegation, emphasising the significance of the visit in cementing the existing ties. “We’re very honoured to have you on this visit,” President Mahama stated. “We believe that this visit would cement the ties and relationship between our two countries.”
President Mahama highlighted Ghana’s historical role as the first sub-Saharan nation to gain independence and its contribution to liberation struggles across the continent, welcoming the King to the “country of freedom and justice.” He reiterated Ghana’s commitment to fostering closer ties among African nations, recalling the vision of Ghana’s first president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, for African unity.
The Ghanaian President also emphasised the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) protocol, which Ghana has ratified. The protocol enables the free movement of goods and services across African markets. He hoped the bilateral discussions would strengthen cooperation and leverage the opportunities presented by the AfCFTA.
“Your visit and the bilateral discussion that will take place after will form the framework for the cooperation between our two countries,” President Mahama remarked.
President Mahama also stated that the King’s visit would feature a significant cultural exchange.

77,"Consultancy Fees, Contract Overlaps, Unaccounted Funds Plague National Cathedral Project, Audit Reveals.","An audit report into Ghana’s National Cathedral project has revealed alarming discrepancies and questionable financial practices involving key consultants and contractors.
Minister of State for Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu (MP), revealed details from the Deloitte & Touche audit, highlighting significant issues with Sir David Adjaye & Associates Ltd., The Nehemiah Group, and the project’s main contractor, Ribade JV.
The audit found troubling variances in consultancy fees paid to Sir David Adjaye & Associates Ltd., with the Office of the President confirming GHS 113,040,564.86 while the firm claimed GHS 117,972,656.00 – an unexplained difference of GHS 4,932,091.14.
Even more concerning, payments totalling GHS 15,738,750 were made to Adjaye’s firm before the formal agreement was signed and before approval by the Public Procurement Authority, indicating serious procurement breaches.
The firm also received payments for “extra work” (including a 350-seater restaurant and museums) estimated at USD 12,430,221, which were not captured in the original contract.
The Nehemiah Group, a consultant for the project, also came under heavy scrutiny. The audit revealed that payments amounting to USD 523,521.03 continued even after their one-year contract expired without renewal.
Furthermore, the firm received USD 110,630.56 for fundraising events that “yielded no tangible results in terms of donations or investment.”
A significant concern was the apparent “double dipping”: The Nehemiah Group was paid for coordination and oversight roles, while Kubik Maltbie, a subcontractor, was “separately contracted for the same project management and coordination services” at USD 592,500, representing approximately 87% of The Nehemiah Group’s total payments over the same period.
The report also flagged inconsistencies in the contract amount with Ribade JV, with figures varying by millions of dollars across different government records and payment claims.
These findings revealed a significant breakdown in financial oversight and contract administration, leading to substantial financial losses and raising questions about accountability among key project stakeholders.
President Mahama has since ordered comprehensive measures, including a forensic audit, to address these deeply concerning issues.","https://presidency.gov.gh/consultancy-fees-contract-overlaps-unaccounted-funds-plague-national-cathedral-project-audit-reveals/","18 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:07.203423"
78,"President Mahama engages regional imam; calls for religious tolerance.","President John Dramani Mahama today reinforced his commitment to religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence, especially between Christians and Muslims.
At a meeting with the Conference of Regional Chief Imams of Ghana at the Presidency, Mr Mahama said his appeal comes amidst recent discussions and controversies surrounding religious practices in mission schools, noting that no student should be compelled to abandon their faith.
The meeting, held at the request of the Conference of Regional Chief Imams, provided a platform for President Mahama to reiterate the fundamental principles enshrined in Ghana’s 1992 Constitution.
“Ghana is a nation of diverse religions, and one of the things our constitution guarantees is the freedom of religion, freedom to worship, and freedom to express one’s religious identity,” the President stated. He stressed that these constitutional guarantees leave no grounds for religious discrimination, whether by Christians against Muslims or vice versa.
President Mahama highlighted the practical challenges faced by students in communities where educational options are limited. “There are times when you find a secondary school which is a Muslim secondary school, Ahmadiyya, Ghana Muslim Mission, or some other mission, in a community. And so, if children want secondary education or even basic education, that is the only school in their community,” he explained.
He further elaborated on the core issue: “It doesn’t help that if Christian children are in a Muslim school, they should be forced to adopt Islam, the same way if a Christian school is in a dominantly Muslim community. It should not compel the students not to express their religion.”
To resolve these tensions and foster greater understanding, President Mahama revealed that the Minister for the Interior is spearheading a comprehensive dialogue process.
This initiative has already led to the signing of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) specifically aimed at promoting religious tolerance and ensuring respectful coexistence within mission schools across the country.
The Secretary to the Conference of Regional Imams, Alhaji Sullah Abdullah Quandah, expressed profound gratitude to President Mahama. He acknowledged the President’s steadfast dedication to the Muslim community and for fulfilling campaign promises made at the 3rd National Conference of Imams in Kumasi in 2023.
Alhaji Quandah cited the additional holiday for Eid al-Fitr as a significant achievement and offered prayers for the materialisation of the President’s vision to improve the human resource base of the Muslim Ummah in the country.

80,"Mahama advises African leaders: “Let’s not kid ourselves about investments.”","President John Dramani Mahama on Thursday co-chaired the second plenary session on the ‘Economy: Co-create Innovative Solutions with Africa’ of the ongoing 9th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in Yokohama, Japan.
Mr Mahama co-chaired the session with former Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, with interventions from Kenyan President William Ruto, Togolese leader Faure Gnassingbe, and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa. The UN Under-Secretary General Cristina Duarte and Comoros President Azali Assoumani also delivered remarks.
In his concluding remarks, President Mahama said TICAD-9 is happening at a time of a rapidly changing world order.
“The world’s largest economy, which should be the driver of global trade and investments, has become more insular and transactional in its relationship with the rest of the world”, he noted.
He had advice for African leaders and their people: “Africa is open for business. We wish to partner with any nation in the world on a win-win basis. But let’s not kid ourselves! Trade and investments will not come to Africa because we wish for it.”
According to President Mahama, “Africa must undertake the hard but necessary reforms, as countries on the continent, to make Africa an attractive destination for investments.”
“That is why we must silence the guns and stop the fighting. That is why we must reform our economies and make them more stable and predictable. This is why we must reform our governance and make public service accountable and corruption-free”, Mr Mahama added.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-advises-african-leaders-lets-not-kid-ourselves-about-investments/","21 August 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:07.381478"
81,"“Be prudent, decisive; I won’t interfere” – Mahama assures Bank of Ghana Governors.","President John Dramani Mahama has advised the leadership of the Central Bank to be guided by recent reckless decisions that plunged the economy into crisis.
He also urged the two senior officials of the bank to be pragmatic and go beyond mere technical considerations in their policy decisions to restore investor confidence.
President Mahama was speaking at the swearing-in of Dr Johnson Pandit Kwesi Asiama as the Governor of the Bank of Ghana and Dr Zakari Mumuni as the First Deputy Governor.
He pledged his full commitment to ensuring the Central Bank operates independently and is guided by its mandate to build a resilient economy.
“Ghana’s financial sector is in crisis, and the huge task ahead demands your experience, foresight, and decisive leadership. With Dr. Asiama, I am confident that we will rebuild trust, restore stability, and put our economy on a sustained growth path. I entrust him with this responsibility, knowing he will serve with diligence and excellence”, he added.
Citing the recent banking history, the President expressed concern about the political interference that resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and lives, as decisions were made with a narrow focus rather than considering the human impact.
“When governments resort to unsustainable consumption expenditures financed by excessive and unregulated money printing, the consequences are severe— from spiraling inflation and erosion of incomes to driving millions into poverty. Such actions not only weaken public confidence in financial institutions but also threaten long-term stability.”
Mr Mahama pledged to ensure that the bank’s operations are guided solely by its mandate—one where policies are driven by discipline, foresight, and the best interests of the Ghanaian people.","https://presidency.gov.gh/be-prudent-decisive-i-wont-interfere-mahama-assures-bank-of-ghana-governors/","26 February 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:07.452676"

He has also encouraged Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), activists, and other groups to continue piling the pressure and advocating for the government to take stronger measures to stop the menace.
“I’m determined. We need your support. We need your criticism, your advocacy, your pressure. Continue to put our feet to the fire, and let’s win this fight together. Our great-grandfathers gave us a beautiful country with trees and beautiful rivers, and we should not hand over poisoned water bodies or desecrated forests to our children and great-grandchildren. I want to personally assure you that as President, I will also continue to put pressure on the Minister and other officials in charge to deliver on our promise”, President Mahama stated at an engagement with CSOs on the fight against illegal mining on Friday.
The President, who sounded optimistic, said the government’s core interest, aside from flushing out the illegal miners, is to apprehend the kingpins who are the heavy financiers and to punish them severely to serve as a deterrent.
“I have nothing to hide. I don’t gain anything from galamsey. I am not personally involved in illegal mining, and I have no interest in it, so you can be assured that we are all on the same side”.

86,"First Lady launches Ghanasco’s 65th anniversary, praises school’s legacy.","First Lady Lordina Dramani Mahama officially launched the 65th anniversary of Ghana Senior High School (GHANASCO) on Saturday in Tamale, emphasising the school’s legacy of excellence and its role in shaping future generations.
As a proud alumna, Mrs. Mahama seized the occasion to highlight President John Dramani Mahama’s dedication to education and the transformative power of learning.
The First Lady lauded GHANASCO’s contribution to Ghana, stating, “GHANASCO is more than just a school; it is a community, a heritage, and a training ground for leaders, professionals, artisans, and patriots.” She celebrated the school’s 65-year commitment to nurturing well-rounded young Ghanaians.
Mrs Mahama proudly acknowledged the achievements of several prominent GHANASCO alumni, including Alhaji Alhassan Andani (former Managing Director of Stanbic Bank Ghana), Dr Mohammed Ibrahim Awal (former Minister for Business Development), John Jinapor (Minister for Energy and Green Transition), Alhassan Suhuyini (Deputy Minister for Roads and Highways), legendary footballers Abedi Pele and Kwame Ayew, and Professor Bashiru Imoro Saeed (Vice Chancellor of Tamale Technical University).
Highlighting the connection between the school and national leadership, the First Lady attributed President John Mahama’s effective leadership, in part, to his GHANASCO education.
“He often speaks fondly of his time here, where the lessons, discipline, friendships, and experiences laid the foundation for his leadership,” she said, adding: “His experiences at Ghanasco deeply influenced his commitment to transforming education as a life-changing experience for every child.”
The First Lady also reiterated the government’s commitment to education, emphasising initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure, enhancing teacher training, prioritising Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), and implementing further initiatives to enhance teaching and learning.
Echoing the First Lady’s sentiments, Professor Saeed emphasised GHANASCO’s founding mission to cultivate future leaders, a goal exemplified by the achievements of both President and Mrs Mahama.
The Headmaster, Mr. Douglas Haruna Yakubu, reflected on the school’s evolution and urged students to emulate the successes of their alumni while avoiding negative behaviours such as vandalism and drug abuse. He also appealed to the government for assistance in providing essential facilities, including a library, assembly hall, dormitory, and improved sanitation.
The Minister of Education, Haruna Iddrisu, assured the school of the government’s support. Reciting a line from the school anthem, he commended the GHANASCO community and announced that tenders for the construction of an assembly hall and dormitory would be issued soon. The Minister also pledged to address the shortage of classroom furniture.
Hon. Iddrisu addressed the matter of student discipline, pledging to empower school authorities to conduct searches and impose stringent penalties for misconduct. He also announced plans to review the basic school curriculum to reinforce the use of native languages as the foundation for learning.
The 65th anniversary will be commemorated in October this year.

98,"Mahama courts Singapore investors, touts 24-hour economy as gateway to $3.4 trillion AfCFTA market","President John Dramani Mahama on Tuesday used the opening of the 8th Africa–Singapore Business Forum to pitch Ghana as a “reliable gateway” to the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), calling Africa “investable” and urging deeper South–South partnerships amid a more fragmented global economy.
“We are here to learn, to partner, and to deliver,” President Mahama said at his first engagement on a three-day state visit to Singapore. “Africa is investable, and Ghana is your reliable gateway to the continent.”
Framing Africa and Asia as the world’s “two youngest, fastest‑urbanising regions,” Mahama said the pair are complementary in resources, markets and know‑how, and should be “champions of open markets, trusted rules and practical partnerships that deliver jobs, technology transfer and shared prosperity.”
President Mahama also warned that “the death knell of multilateralism is sounding” as tariffs proliferate and supply chains remain fragile, arguing that tighter global financial conditions demand new alliances.
He, however, insisted the fundamentals in Africa are compelling: a 1.4 billion‑strong population that is young and digitally connected; a $3.4 trillion single market under the AfCFTA; and leadership in mobile money and fintech adoption.
Trade ties are already deepening. Mahama noted Africa–Singapore trade climbed about 50% between 2020 and 2024 to nearly $14 billion, with West Africa accounting for more than half. Ghana–Singapore trade reached more than $215 million in 2024, while 69 Singaporean companies are registered in Ghana with cumulative investments exceeding $2 billion.
Positioning Ghana as a continental launchpad, Mahama pointed to Accra’s role as host of the AfCFTA Secretariat and to the country’s access to more than 400 million consumers through ECOWAS. “Ghana is, therefore, a trusted entry point to scale across the continent,” he said.
He also outlined a slate of domestic reforms and flagship projects intended to sharpen Ghana’s competitiveness and absorb more capital.
“Ghana is OPEN FOR BUSINESS 24 hours a day,” Mahama said, describing his national strategy to align infrastructure, incentives and skills so factories, farms, ports and service centres can run round‑the‑clock shifts safely and competitively.
He also touted his four integrated pillars — Grow24 (irrigating more than 2 million hectares for year-round farming), Make24 (agro-industrial parks for textiles, pharmaceuticals, and food processing), Show24 (tourism along Lake Volta), and Connect24 (turning Lake Volta into an inland transport spine to cut logistics costs).
Mahama said inflation is easing, the cedi has stabilised, and ratings outlooks are improving. The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre now offers sector‑specific, region‑by‑region opportunity maps to guide decisions with “credible data.”
He cast Singapore as a catalytic partner for Africa across finance, logistics and technology. “Your excellence in project preparation, blended finance, risk management, standards and dispute resolution is precisely what African projects need to move from pipeline to bankable to build,” he told the audience, which included Singapore’s Ministers, trade officials and corporate leaders.
The president also used the platform to press for reforms to the global financial architecture and to highlight Africa’s homegrown integration efforts. As the African Union Champion on Financial Institutions, he cited an annual African financing gap of roughly $1.3 trillion, with infrastructure needs of $181–$221 billion per year through 2030 and a climate‑finance shortfall of about $213 billion annually.
Mahama summed up Ghana’s offer to investors as “a stable, reform‑minded country, connected to the AfCFTA, designed for scale,” with “a pipeline of investable projects in agribusiness, logistics, manufacturing, energy, digital and tourism” and “a partner that values integrity, predictability and long‑term relationships.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-courts-singapore-investors-touts-24-hour-economy-as-gateway-to-3-4-trillion-afcfta-market/","26 August 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:08.521865"

100,"Mahama Advocates Strategic Infrastructure Investment to Unlock AfCFTA’s Full Potential","President John Dramani Mahama is advocating massive investment in strategic infrastructure across the African continent, particularly transport networks and digital connectivity, to fully unlock the potential of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement.
He made these remarks during a courtesy call by Mr. Wamkele Mene, Secretary General of the AfCFTA Secretariat.
Highlighting current challenges, President Mahama said inadequate road and rail networks across sub-regions have significantly hampered the effectiveness of existing regional trade agreements.
He stressed that the vision of the African Union’s New Partnership for Africa’s Development (AU-NEPAD) calls for proactive measures to seamlessly integrate and open up economies.
Citing the high volume of trade along the Abidjan-Lagos corridor, the longest route along the West African coastal belt, President Mahama articulated his vision for enhanced regional integration.
“If we invest in crucial corridors like the Abidjan-Lagos route and extend it all the way to Dakar, we will create a seamless channel for the exchange of goods, significantly boosting intra-African trade,” he stated.
The President also highlighted the increasing trade volumes between Ghana and its Sahelian neighbours, such as Burkina Faso and Mali, noting the immense potential for transit trade facilitated by improved connectivity.
President Mahama told Mr. Mene, “We are proud to be the hosts of the AfCFTA Secretariat, and our government remains fully committed to facilitating your crucial work and ensuring its success.”
On his part, Mr. Wamkele Mene began by congratulating President Mahama on his recent re-election victory and commended Ghanaians for the peaceful transition of power.
Providing an update on the AfCFTA’s progress since its establishment on May 30, 2019, Mr. Mene reported that forty-nine (49) out of fifty-five (55) African Union member states have now ratified the agreement, demonstrating strong continental commitment.
He added that twenty-four (24) countries are actively trading under the AfCFTA framework, with Ghana notably serving as one of the pilot countries since trading commenced two years ago.
Mr. Mene also noted that countries, including Benin, Libya, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, and Eritrea, are yet to ratify the agreement.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-advocates-strategic-infrastructure-investment-to-unlock-afcftas-full-potential/","19 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:08.648413"
101,"Gov’t implementing new measures to combat illegal mining, including excavator import permits.","President John Dramani Mahama has announced a comprehensive government initiative to curb illegal mining (galamsey) activities and promote sustainable mining practices.
Key components of the initiative include a new permit regime for excavator imports and improved tracking of heavy-duty mining equipment nationwide.
President Mahama announced this in his address to open the Mining in Motion Summit 2025 in Accra. The summit was on the theme “Sustainable Mining and Local Growth – Leveraging Resources for Global Impact”.
“The indiscriminate environmental degradation, water pollution, and displacement of communities resulting from illegal mining will no longer be tolerated,” President Mahama stated.
“We are changing the permitting regime to ensure that no excavator is imported or shipped into the country without prior authorisation.”
The government’s strategy involves a multifaceted approach to enhancing the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks of the mining sector.
This includes requiring permits for importing excavators and implementing a nationwide tracking system to monitor the movement of heavy-duty mining equipment; prohibiting the use of toxic chemicals such as mercury in gold processing; and enforcing mandatory site rehabilitation clauses in small-scale and medium-scale mining licences to ensure land reclamation.
The others are reinforcing the implementation of community development agreements to benefit local communities impacted by mining operations and promoting the use of renewable energy sources in mining activities.
President Mahama emphasised the government’s commitment to ensuring that all mining activities in Ghana leave a positive environmental footprint.
“Under the new framework, every ounce of gold or gram of lithium mined in Ghana will leave a positive green footprint,” he declared.
President Mahama highlighted Ghana’s potential to play a central role in the clean energy transition.
“The world is transitioning. The use of fossil fuels is waning, and clean energy is rising. With this comes a surge in demand for critical minerals like lithium, graphite, nickel and other rare earth minerals. Ghana is ready to play a central role.”
The President revealed that the government is developing a legal and investment policy framework to promote the responsible exploration and development of critical mineral reserves. This framework aims to attract ethical, long-term investors, promote local content, and facilitate technology transfer.","https://presidency.gov.gh/govt-implementing-new-measures-to-combat-illegal-mining-including-excavator-import-permits/","03 June 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:08.708750"

“Last week, I received the investigative report on the two incidents. It details and catalogues everyone who was affected by the violence and the circumstances that led to it,” President Mahama said.
“We have handed it over to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General will review it and, where necessary, hold people culpable and bring them to book,” he added.
He noted that government has tasked the Attorney-General to determine adequate compensation for victims, including the families of those who died and those living with injuries.
“What is the adequate compensation that we can give to people like that?” he said.
President Mahama also noted that electoral violence has affected not only innocent bystanders and political activists but also journalists carrying out their legitimate work.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-pledges-full-implementation-of-election-violence-probe-report/","05 September 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:08.770264"

108,"President Mahama flags off work on second phase of Blekusu sea defence project.","President John Dramani Mahama was in Agavedzi on Saturday for a groundbreaking ceremony for the second phase of the Blekusu Coastal Protection Project.
The project, a significant initiative that will protect lives and livelihoods in the Ketu South Municipality of the Volta Region, was met with palpable joy and deep gratitude from the chiefs and people of the Some and Aflao Traditional Areas, who gathered to witness the realisation of a long-awaited development.
The ceremony saw an emotional outpouring of appreciation, as community members sang praises and danced, celebrating the President’s commitment to addressing their decades-long struggle against severe tidal erosion.
Upon completion in four years, the project, which will protect an 8-kilometre stretch of coastline, is set to bring immense relief to the communities of Blekusu, Agavedzi, Salakope, Amutsinu, and Adina.
Messrs Amandi Holding Limited is the contractor and will deliver 37 groins, extensive dune restoration, reinforced embankments, and other critical shoreline defence structures.
President Mahama stated that the project is a comprehensive one that will extend beyond mere coastal protection.
“Aside from the coastal protection works, government has incorporated vital development projects to enhance the lives of the people in the affected area,” he noted.
These integrated initiatives include a modern fish market, cold storage and processing facilities for fisherfolk, dedicated spaces for fish drying and smoking, a car park, and a lorry station. Additionally, public sanitation facilities and a comprehensive waste collection system will be provided.
“The sea has taken a lot from this community. It has taken land, it has taken livelihoods, and it has taken our peace of mind. But today, I stand here to say no more will the sea consume our land”, the President said.
“We are here to reclaim what has been lost, to rebuild stronger, to offer our children a future where they are not forced to flee their homes because of rising tidal waves.”
President Mahama added that the Blekusu Coastal Protection Project and other ongoing infrastructure developments reflect his government’s strong dedication to building a better Ghana.
“This is not merely symbolic,” he asserted, “but a clear demonstration of what responsive leadership can do when it listens, when it cares, and when it acts.”
Phase I of the project, covering 4.3 kilometres of coastal defence works, commenced in 2015 under the Presidency of Mahama to mitigate the serious threat of tidal erosion in Ketu South.
While that phase offered significant relief, the President lamented, “Unfortunately, for nearly a decade after this, the second phase of the project stalled. Despite repeated appeals by residents, Members of Parliament, traditional authorities, and civil society, the project did not commence.”
The President specifically referenced the devastating tidal waves that pounded the communities in 2017 and again in 2021, recalling the harrowing images.
I can still picture the videos and photos showing the aftermath of these tidal waves,” he said, highlighting “the pain, the anxiety, the fear that was etched on the faces of our fellow citizens.”
He reaffirmed the pledge he made earlier this year during his visit to the Volta Region, promising swift action.
“And today, I am proud to say that this commitment is being fulfilled. Your cries have not been in vain. Your voices will no longer be ignored. Today is your day – a day of renewal and a day of reassurance.”
President Mahama also announced progress on the West Africa Coastal Areas (WACA) Programme, designed to enhance coastal resilience across the sub-region.
Currently awaiting approval, the WACA project is envisioned to extend coastal protection from where the Blekusu project ends, all the way to Aflao, securing Ghana’s vital 550-kilometre coastline, which supports countless livelihoods through fishing, trade, and tourism.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-flags-off-work-on-second-phase-of-blekusu-sea-defence-project/","20 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:09.299064"

Mr Mahama lauded the High Commissioner for her “positive engagements” throughout her time in the country. He reflected on the long-standing historical relationship between Ghana and the UK, describing it as having been “so far so good”.
The president, however, emphasised the mutual need for deeper economic partnerships and trade moving forward. He also noted the dynamic changes in the global landscape, including the diminishing nature of traditional development assistance and the necessity for developing countries like Ghana to strategically reposition themselves.
President Mahama also acknowledged the UK’s significant support in counter-terrorism efforts, specifically commending cooperation in intelligence gathering and training.
“We appreciate the partnership we have shared in the fight against terrorism,” President Mahama stated. We will continue to rely on the UK for help and cooperation in intelligence gathering and training to prepare ourselves in the event of any attack.”
Shifting to regional matters, Mr Mahama updated the High Commissioner on his recent proactive engagements with leaders in the Sahelian countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. He pledged further diplomatic efforts aimed at rebuilding trust and improving relationships with these neighbours.
He announced that the upcoming ECOWAS meeting on Sunday – the first since he assumed office – would place the issues concerning the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) at the top of its agenda.
“I am going to have the opportunity to report to the rest of the ECOWAS leaders on trips I made to the three countries and share some of my perspectives about their grievances and how we can redefine relationships,” he told the outgoing envoy.
On the domestic economic front, President Mahama provided an optimistic outlook, reporting progress with a strengthening Cedi, declining inflation, and renewed investor confidence.
“I am happy to report that it’s going well,” he said, detailing the first quarter economic performance report. “The first quarter report on economic performance indicates a GDP growth of 5.3 per cent, inflation has reduced from 23 per cent to 18 per cent since January, and we hope to bring it down to 13 per cent by the end of the year, so that should create some relief for Ghanaians in terms of the cost of living and we will continue to maintain fiscal discipline.”

The meeting opened on a solemn note, with President Macron offering condolences for the recent passing of Ghana’s former First Lady, Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings.
Both leaders praised the Paris Peace Initiative and the strengthening of relations between Ghana and France. A key focus of the talks was Ghana’s request for French assistance in combating piracy in its territorial waters. President Mahama sought support to protect Ghana’s maritime integrity from increasing piratical threats in the Gulf of Guinea.
The two leaders also discussed a French concessionary loan for Ghana’s health sector that is awaiting parliamentary approval. President Mahama asked his French counterpart to use his influence with the International Monetary Fund to secure Ghana’s access to the facility from the French Development Bank, noting Ghana’s improved debt-to-GDP ratio.
President Mahama, in his capacity as the African Union (AU) Champion of African Financial Institutions, advocated for collaboration to renegotiate loan agreements with lower interest rates for infrastructure projects.
He emphasised Ghana’s role as home to the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) secretariat and the need for enhanced road infrastructure to facilitate intra-African trade.
The Mahama highlighted Ghana’s ambitious one-million-coders programme, which has already registered 200,000 students. He requested French support to train additional French language teachers to improve language education in Ghanaian schools.
President Macron noted several upcoming opportunities for collaboration, including the VivaTech Summit in Nairobi in May 2026, where Ghana could showcase its digital innovation capabilities, the African Union-European Union summit in Angola, and the June 2026 G7 summit, where France would advocate for increased support for Ghana.
President Mahama raised the subject of reparations for slavery, which Ghana is currently championing. President Macron pledged support for the initiative, noting that France had criminalised slavery, while cautioning that the reparations discussion should acknowledge the involvement of various actors beyond Western powers.
The leaders discussed the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel region, particularly terrorist incursions in Mali and other countries of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).
President Macron commended President Mahama’s leadership in the subregion, and Ghana’s economic reforms, pledging continued French support for Ghana’s development agenda.

118,"President Mahama & Global Leaders Launch the Accra Reset at UNGA 2025.","At a high-level side event during the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, President John Dramani Mahama, the African Union Champion for African Financial Institutions, led heads of state, multilateral leaders, and private sector partners in launching the Accra Reset.
The Accra Reset is a bold framework for re-engineering global development institutions, financing, and partnerships as the Sustainable Development Goals era nears its close.
Opening the event, President Mahama stated that the current development architecture is fraying. COVID-19 has erased two decades of progress in less than two years, extreme climate shocks now threaten nearly 735 million people with hunger, and many developing countries spend more servicing debt than on health and education.
With fewer than half of the 169 SDG targets on track, Mahama argued that “development‑as‑usual” must end.
“The world is only five years from 2030,” President Mahama said. “The question is not simply what new targets should replace the SDGs, but how we design institutions and financing systems that actually work. ‘Workability’ is the name of the game now—innovative financing instruments, new business models and smarter coalitions that multiply resources rather than ration them.”
The Accra Reset, led by President Mahama and his co-convenor, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, proposes a new architecture anchored in sovereignty, workability and shared value.
Health will serve as an entry point and proof of concept, transitioning from aid dependency to health sovereignty, building on commitments made at the Africa Health Sovereignty Summit in Accra in August 2025. A Club of Accra coalition will initiate work to pilot financing innovations and “geostrategic dealrooms” for investment in health, climate, food security, and job creation.
The launch also saw the unveiling of the Global Presidential Council, which will unite a coalition of Heads of State and Government from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and beyond to provide political leadership and accountability. A Global College of Advisors, comprising eminent experts from health, finance, innovation, and business, will also be assembled to design and oversee pilots and financing mechanisms.
Supporters at the launch included political and institutional leaders who affirmed their support for the Accra Reset.
– Olusegun Obasanjo, Co‑Patron of AfroChampions: urged solidarity “fit for the new era” and a move away from aid dependency.
– Gordon Brown: called the Reset “a plan for the future” and endorsed building health sovereignty.
– President William Ruto (speech read on his behalf): emphasised financing national ambition and holding the Global Presidential Council accountable for progress toward universal health coverage.
– Prime Minister Mia Mottley: committed to practical alignment on skills and industrial policy to make pharmaceutical manufacturing viable.
– Aigboje Aig‑Imoukhuede, Chairman of Access Bank: pledged significant private‑sector leadership and financing.
– Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Dr Ngozi Okonjo‑Iweala conveyed institutional support for “rewiring” global norms.
Concluding the launch, President Mahama recalled the Monterrey Consensus of 2001, which helped create GAVI and the Global Fund, and said the world now needs “a new vision of multilateralism” that moves from wish lists to engines of sustainable value creation.

119,"Let’s collaborate to exploit full potential of AfCFTA- Mahama to Grenada PM","Ghana and Grenada, a Caribbean Island nation, are taking their diplomatic cooperation to a new level following high-level talks between President John Dramani Mahama and Prime Minister Dickon Amiss Thomas Mitchell in Accra.
President Mahama is calling for closer collaboration to tap the full potential of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) by sharing experiences in exploiting the abundant resources in both countries.
President Mahama said Ghana is the headquarters of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a historic trade agreement that was signed, and that, so far, more than 50 countries have ratified it.
The president believes it is an opportunity for African and Caribbean businesses to invest together to tap into a market of 1.3 billion people with a GDP of more than $3 trillion.
This was his opening remark during high-level discussions on Friday during the Grenadian Prime Minister’s visit. The discussions focused on political consultations, trade, culture, education and visa waivers.
President Mahama said, “We are happy that your visit will allow us to continue with the rapprochement that we have been engaged in, especially with the MoUs that we have signed, one being the MoU on political consultation.”
The President, who sounded optimistic, said beyond trade, culture, and education, citizens of the two countries will bond more through the visa waivers.
“Our two citizens should be able to travel freely between each other, and so it’s something that we’ll work on to make sure that it’s fully implemented.”
We have received a few complaints from Grenadian citizens who had a bad experience, but we are asking the Foreign Ministry to resolve the issues so we can fully implement the visa waiver for all types of passports, including diplomatic, service, and online passports.
On his part, Prime Minister Mitchell said he feels very much at home. He disclosed that in July this year, at the African Bank Conference, he revealed his DNA ancestry tracing on his maternal side, and it was traced to the Akan people of Ghana.
“So, I think the Akwaaba that was given to me yesterday is a reflection of the homecoming that is deeply personal to me, anecdotal to Grenada and the Caribbean,” he said.
“I am told 75% of the population of Grenada can trace its ancestry to Ghana. So, the very first African country I visited was Ghana.”
Prime Minister Mitchel called for the deliberate use of the ocean as a bridge to make sure that they in the Caribbean could reconnect in a deliberate way with their roots, both politically, socially, culturally, and importantly, economically as well.
The Prime Minister also extended a special invitation to President Mahama to visit Grenada at his own convenience in 2026.","https://presidency.gov.gh/lets-collaborate-to-exploit-full-potential-of-afcfta-mahama-to-grenada-pm/","17 October 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:10.042959"

The meeting provided an opportunity for the President to discuss the challenges in the power sector with industry producers.
During the discussion, he emphasized the need to revitalize the operations of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) to prevent losses in downstream distribution. President Mahama assured the IPPs of his commitment to improving the sector’s efficiency to attract further investments.
He expressed concern over the mismanagement of revenue from the Energy Sector Recovery Levy (ESLA), which, instead of addressing accumulated debts, was diverted to other uses. Highlighting the broader financial challenges, he stated, “While we take responsibility for solving the problems, we must let Ghanaians know the reality. Ghana seeks $3 billion from the IMF for macroeconomic stability, yet the energy sector debt has ballooned to $2.5 billion. ECG has become the ‘sick man’ with over 40% losses.”
President Mahama further indicated his intent to revisit the stalled Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) deal, which had been disrupted by the PDS scandal, to enhance efficiency in distribution and billing systems.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-meets-independent-power-producers/","13 January 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:10.158154"

124,"Mahama shares Ghana’s debt restructuring lessons at AU conference.","President John Dramani Mahama addressed fellow African leaders at the African Union Conference on Debt in Lomé, Togo, on Monday, sharing insights from Ghana’s experience with debt restructuring.
He emphasised the importance of transparency and timely engagement with creditors to avoid severe economic consequences from reactive debt management decisions.
The president highlighted the significant infrastructure gap facing Africa, which requires an estimated $130-170 billion in annual investment. He noted that the lack of access to affordable, long-term financing options often leaves nations with unsustainable debt burdens.
Citing IMF data, the President expressed concern that 22 African countries are currently in or at high risk of debt distress. He pointed out that the average public debt-to-GDP ratio in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to exceed 60% in 2025, a significant increase from 40% a decade ago.
Drawing from Ghana’s history, President Mahama referenced the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which enabled Ghana to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio from over 100% to under 30%. This, he explained, freed up crucial fiscal space for investments in key sectors like education, roads, and healthcare.
“Ghana, like many of our peers, has had to undergo painful restructuring to restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence,” President Mahama stated. He highlighted Ghana’s strategic use of concessional and non-concessional financing between the early 2000s and 2015 to accelerate infrastructure development and social inclusion.
The President detailed how, after initial progress, Ghana’s debt situation deteriorated due to a combination of unrestrained borrowing and multiple external shocks, leading to a debt-to-GDP ratio increase from 56.3% in 2016 to a peak of 90.7% in 2022.
He noted that by 2023, interest payments alone consumed 47% of total government revenue, a level deemed fiscally unsustainable by the World Bank.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-shares-ghanas-debt-restructuring-lessons-at-au-conference-2/","13 May 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:10.350917"

He also highlighted the reactivation of the Constitution Review Implementation Committee as a pivotal opportunity to refine respective roles and better integrate traditional wisdom and authority into the national governance framework.
President Mahama also outlined key infrastructure projects for the Ashanti region, including the highly anticipated Accra-Kumasi Expressway.
“We hope to cut sod for the Accra-Kumasi Expressway project early next year,” he announced.
He also pledged to complete several suspended projects, including Phase II of the Kejetia market, the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital Maternity and Children’s Block, the Suame interchange, the Afari Military Hospital, and the extension of the runway at Prempeh International Airport to accommodate larger aircraft.","https://presidency.gov.gh/asantehene-urges-mahama-to-maintain-humility-boldness-in-governance/","03 June 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:10.476698"

The President handed over the report to the Attorney General and Minister for Justice with a directive to immediately begin investigations into the committee’s findings.
He noted that the findings of the ORAL report call for sober reflection on the massive financial leakages that should have been invested in education, healthcare, infrastructure and social development.
Presenting a summary of the findings, the Chairman of the Committee, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, also Ghana’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, said the value of thirty-six (36) financial cases reviewed is estimated at $20.49 billion.

The vehicles include fifteen (15) armoured pickups, five Cobra-Four and twenty Cobra-Three special armoured cars fitted with state-of-the-art electronic systems. According to the President, these form part of the first set of hardware and will be supplemented by two tow trucks and ten (10) covert operational vehicles.
Government would also give every police district office a pickup for patrol duties.
He used the occasion to caution the public against emerging incidents of attacks on law enforcement agencies.
“We will give you the right instruments so that as you do your duty, you also are safe and able to come back to your families,” he assured.
“Too often, we have lost men in the line of duty because we send them on missions and assignments without providing them with the appropriate equipment to ensure their safety. And that is why from the start of my administration, I committed to retooling and modernising all our security agencies.”
President Mahama assured the officers and the families that his government will ensure that these acts of lawlessness become a thing of the past.
According to him, the ceremony is not just about machinery and equipment, but “about our readiness, responsibility, and assurance that when danger arises, the state will be there to protect us.”
“These vehicles have been procured as operational tools, not as symbols. They are designed to strengthen police response in high-risk environments. They enhance officer protection when you are engaged in dangerous operations. They reinforce patrols in rugged terrain and high crime zones.”
He continued, “Today’s handing over is a significant fulfilment of the commitment I made. Our security policy is anchored on a simple truth. Peace is not accidental.

The ghost names were detected following a head count of active National Service personnel, conducted at the behest of the Minister for Finance as a prerequisite for clearing allowance arrears dating back to August 2024.
The Ministry of Finance released GHS 226,019,224 upon completing the head count, covering the arrears for ninety-eight thousand, one hundred and forty-five (98,145) actual National Service Personnel. This figure is 81,885 less than the 180,030 names presented by the previous management of the Authority for allowance payment in 2024.

Speaking at the official inauguration ceremony, President Mahama stated that, under Act 1140, Goldbod now holds exclusive rights to purchase and export all gold produced in Ghana, except for gold produced by large-scale mining firms.
“Through the GoldBod, we are setting national sovereignty over our mineral wealth and introducing a paradigm shift from raw extraction to value addition,” President Mahama said.
He emphasised that the Task Force is far more than just a security initiative. “It is a strategic arm of national economic transformation,” the President noted, “purposefully designed to restore integrity, accountability, and value to Ghana’s gold sector.”
In a strong warning to illicit operators, President Mahama declared, “Let this serve as a clear warning to all those involved in gold smuggling and the illegal trade. The law is going to be enforced without fear or favour.”
To encourage public participation in combating illegal activities, the President announced a reward system: whistleblowers whose leads result in arrests or the retrieval of gold or cash will receive a 10% lump sum of the value involved.
Addressing members of the newly inaugurated Task Force, President Mahama cautioned sternly against any form of compromise or abuse of their authority.
He served notice that any member found to be in breach of their mandate would face severe sanctions, including outright dismissal, prosecution, and forfeiture of their entitlements.
The President further detailed the stringent penalties enshrined in the Goldbod Act, 2025, for violations by any individual or entity operating outside the law.
“Any breach of this Act,” he warned, “could lead to a hefty fine of up to GHS 2.4 million or imprisonment for a term of five to 10 years, or both.”
Key provisions of the Goldbod Act highlighted by the President include a strict prohibition of unlicensed trading of gold and an explicit ban on foreigners purchasing gold on the local market.
He clarified that foreign entities interested in legitimate engagement with Ghana’s gold sector may apply to the Goldbod for licences to offtake gold or invest in refining and value-adding processes.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-inaugurates-goldbod-task-force/","08 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:10.838065"

The 19-member committee, chaired by the President himself, will lead the implementation of the 24-Hour Economy policy, prioritising value addition and economic diversification through strong partnerships with the private sector, particularly in agro-processing and light manufacturing.
President Mahama, an advocate for job creation and national development under his #ResettingGhana agenda, emphasised the critical role of the Committee in achieving ambitious economic goals.
“Through targeted incentives and strategic partnerships, we will scale up local production and participation in the value chain,” Mahama stated during the inauguration.
“Our 24-hour economy strategy will complement this ambition by developing focused value chains including cassava, tomato, palm oil, pharmaceuticals, textiles and garments, and industrial machinery.”
The President expressed confidence that implementing the export development strategies would lower the national unemployment rate from 14.7% to below 5% by 2034.
To facilitate efficient export operations, the government will invest heavily in modernising critical infrastructure, including upgrading and expanding ports, revitalising the Volta Lake Transport Company, developing the Mpakadan Port, operationalising the Boankra Inland Port, and expanding cold chain infrastructure to support the fisheries and horticultural sectors.
The Accelerated Export Development Programme and the National Export Development Strategy are central to achieving these goals.
“We aim to grow Ghana’s non-traditional export earnings from $3.5 billion annually to at least $10 billion by 2030,” President Mahama affirmed.
The Accelerated Export Development Advisory Committee will foster close collaboration with the private sector, development partners, academia, and regional institutions to address export barriers, identify emerging opportunities, and drive coordinated reforms.
The Committee will be supported by the 24-hour economy secretariat, the Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA), the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and other relevant agencies to ensure a seamless transition from strategic planning to tangible results.

135,"President sets up committee to plan educational forum","President John Dramani Mahama has tasked an eight-member committee, chaired by Professor K. T. Oduro, to plan and organise a National Education Forum.
The committee has two weeks to submit its report, which should include a proposed central theme and sub-themes to promote meaningful engagement with stakeholders in the education sector.
In a statement, the acting Spokesperson for the President, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, detailed a nine-point terms of reference for the committee. These include:
1. Identifying key stakeholders within the education community.
2. Suggesting a venue and dates for the forum.
3. Estimating a budget for the forum, and
4. Drafting a national policy framework, along with an action plan for implementation and recommendations, to be submitted within three weeks following the forum.

136,"Bibiani Gold Stars & Asante Kotoko receive $50K each for CAF Continental Campaigns.","President John Dramani Mahama on Saturday demonstrated the government’s unwavering commitment to sports development by presenting a sum of $50,000.00 each to Ghana Premier League champions Bibiani Gold Stars and MTN FA Cup holders Asante Kotoko.
This is to support Bibiani Gold Stars in their pursuit of the 2025-2026 Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League title and Asante Kotoko in their quest for the CAF Confederations Cup.
Addressing representatives of both clubs at the Presidency in Accra, President Mahama said the funds would primarily “defray essential travel and accommodation costs” for their demanding continental campaigns.
“As you embark on this journey into Africa,” President Mahama charged the players, “I want to encourage you to do us proud. We will stand by you. We will help you.”
He drew inspiration from the “sterling performance” of legendary Ghanaian teams like Asante Kotoko and Accra Hearts of Oak in the 1960s and 70s, urging the current generation to “bring back the past glory to Ghana’s football.”
The President shared his personal pride when, during his travels across the continent, Ghana was recognised as a formidable sporting nation.
Mr Mahama said his administration’s strategic prioritisation of sports is linked directly to sound fiscal management.
“With the savings we are making in terms of expenditure, by cutting down the size of government and avoiding waste of our national resources, it frees up more resources for us to invest in the things that are important. And sports is one of them.”
He outlined the government’s expansive plans for sports infrastructure, announcing that the 2026 Budget and Economic Policy Statement would include provisions for the construction of “about seven brand new stadiums” across the country.
This initiative, aiming for “every region to have a stadium fit for purpose,” is designed to “improve playing conditions and make Ghana’s football more competitive.”
Looking ahead, he announced the establishment of a dedicated “Sports Development Fund,” explaining, “We’re encouraging corporate businesses and all others, including government, to put money into it, so that we can support you when you go into African competitions and even when you’re playing locally.”
“Our expectations are high. You carry the expectations of all Ghanaians on your shoulders. The good thing about sports, and especially football, is that it unites us. If we invest in sports, particularly football, we’re investing in building a united country. And that is not resources that have been wasted.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/bibiani-gold-stars-asante-kotoko-receive-50k-each-for-caf-continental-campaigns/","21 September 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:11.102783"

The amount, equivalent to $4,130, is the lowest within the sub-region and will make the pilgrimage more accessible to the Muslim community.

Mahama urged the NDPC to deliver a “bold and transformative path” for the nation, empowering Ghanaians to overcome past limitations.
Established under the 1992 Constitution and governed by Acts 479 and 480, the NDPC is responsible for preparing national development plans, monitoring government programs, and advising the President and Parliament.
The President emphasised the importance of broad consultation with citizens in fulfilling this mandate. He also noted the NDPC’s crucial role in developing the Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies, which he is required to present to Parliament within two years.
The programme, he said, would form the basis for the Medium-Term National Development Policy Framework.","https://presidency.gov.gh/37-member-ndpc-inaugurated/","20 May 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:11.338864"

The courtesy visit marked the conclusion of Ambassador Krull’s four-year term of duty, which President Mahama described as highly productive.
President Mahama reiterated Ghana’s commitment to building on the strong foundation of bilateral relations between the two countries. He emphasised the potential for deepened cooperation, particularly in the critical areas of economic development and security.
The President specifically commended Germany for its consistent support towards enhancing Ghana’s security architecture, citing significant contributions to the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) and capacity-building initiatives for security personnel.
Addressing the evolving security landscape in the sub-region, President Mahama highlighted the growing threat posed by extreme terrorism, especially prevalent in the Sahel. He expressed Ghana’s readiness to work closely with Germany on targeted capacity training programmes aimed at bolstering regional efforts to combat this menace.
Touching upon the complex issue of irregular migration, President Mahama outlined Ghana’s collaborative efforts with international partners, including the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the European Union (EU). He stressed the importance of creating sustainable local opportunities for young people to mitigate the risks associated with perilous journeys across the Sahara and the Mediterranean.
President Mahama conveyed Ghana’s deep appreciation for Ambassador Krul’s service. “We appreciate you. You’re a friend of Ghana. And you’re welcome to visit any time you miss Ghana.

Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS): Recognising the urgent need for updated equipment, new fire tenders will be acquired to replace ageing and broken-down vehicles, some nearly a decade old. “We understand the frustrations of our citizens when the Fire Service arrives late, and this initiative aims to equip them to respond more effectively to emergencies”, the president noted.
Ghana Police Service: To better combat armed robbery, the Police Service will receive armoured vehicles to ensure the safety of officers during patrols. “We must provide our brave officers with the necessary tools to confront criminals effectively”, he added.
Immigration & Prisons Services: Acknowledging the mobility challenges faced by the Immigration and Prisons Services, new vehicles will be allocated to improve their operational capacity and enhance public safety.

146,"Japan promises to support Volivo bridge project; invites Mahama to TICAD","Japan has reaffirmed to President John Mahama its keen interest in financing the construction of a bridge over the Volta Lake at Volivo, a vital element of Ghana’s Eastern Corridor road project.
Miyazaki Katsura, Senior Executive Vice President of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), conveyed this commitment during a courtesy call with President Mahama on Tuesday.
The proposed Volivo bridge, set to complete the vital Eastern Corridor road, is a key project listed in President Mahama’s $10 billion “Big Push” initiative aimed at significantly upgrading Ghana’s infrastructure.
The Big Push, outlined in the 2025 budget, envisions investing $2 billion annually over the next five years in critical sectors, including roads, bridges, education, and healthcare.
“We are happy that the Volivo Bridge project is captured under the Big Push initiative,” Katsura stated, assuring President Mahama of JICA’s commitment to facilitate further discussions with the Japanese government.
He also revealed that a technical team would be dispatched to Ghana to assess the additional funding required for the project.
Mr Mahama secured Japan’s confirmation to fund the project during a visit to Tokyo in his previous term as President.
The president also accepted an invitation to the 9th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in August, noting that he will engage with the government to secure the necessary funding for the construction.","https://presidency.gov.gh/japan-promises-to-support-volivo-bridge-project-invites-mahama-to-ticad/","03 June 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:11.749068"

The inauguration fulfils a key commitment by President Mahama to strengthen the links between the nation’s leading teaching hospital and its premier university.
Named the Transitional Management Committee, the body is co-chaired by two distinguished Ghanaians: Professor Aaron Lawson, a seasoned academic and former Provost of the College of Health Sciences at the University of Ghana, and Professor Mutawakilu Iddrissu, a Neurosurgeon at the Department of Surgery, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital.
The committee has been given a comprehensive mandate to guide the transition process. Its key responsibilities include:
1. Conducting a comprehensive review of the legal mandates, operational structures, and academic frameworks of both UGMC and the University of Ghana Medical School.
2. Developing integration guidelines to ensure coherence between UGMC’s clinical mandates and the university’s teaching and research mandates.
3. Designing a practical roadmap with clear timelines and a communication plan for stakeholders.
4. Facilitating all necessary legal and administrative processes for the seamless transfer and integration.
5. Identifying potential challenges, particularly in funding, staffing, and resource allocation, and proposing sustainable solutions.
6. Establishing a transition secretariat to provide operational and logistical support.
7. Reviewing expressions of interest for partnership by international health care institutions.
8. Submitting a comprehensive report to the President of the Republic within three months from the date of inauguration.
President Mahama emphasised the significance of the committee’s work, urging the members to “work diligently with a sense of historic responsibility,” adding, “You’re laying the foundation for a legacy of health care and medical education excellence. You’re building a bridge between the past and the future.”
The President described the UGMC as currently “a beacon of excellence, a world-class medical institution with a national mandate.”
He noted that the Centre “hosts the largest digitised medical simulation and training centre in West Africa,” which has “the potential to provide cutting-edge training for healthcare professionals across the West African sub-region.”
Built during President Mahama’s first term in office at a cost of $271 million and commissioned before he handed over power, the University of Ghana Medical Centre is a quaternary health facility.
It provides specialised care in numerous areas, including urology, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, cardiology, dermatology, neurology, and interventional radiology for cancers.
The facility also boasts amenities such as a medical hotel for clients, assisted reproductive technology services for fertility solutions, and a helipad for airlifting emergency cases.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-inaugurates-committee-for-ugmc-transfer-to-university-of-ghana/","12 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:11.808748"

This will ensure that their voices are heard in the policymaking process.
Referring to the recent election of Ghana’s first female Vice President, Mr Mahama said it is a testament to his commitment to inclusive leadership.
“Africa’s future lies in its youth, and over 60% of our population is under 25. Yet, their voices are largely absent in policymaking. We must institutionalise frameworks that empower our young people and women to lead at all levels of governance”, he noted.

149,"STATEMENT: African Health Sovereignty in A Reimagined Global Health Governance Architecture: A Co‑creation Summit under the leadership of His Excellency John Dramani Mahama, President of the Republic of Ghana","On 5 August 2025, Accra will host a landmark gathering of African Heads of State, policymakers, and global health stakeholders at the Africa Health Sovereignty Summit.
Convened by His Excellency John Dramani Mahama, President of the Republic of Ghana, this summit will serve as a call to reimagine global health governance amid a rapidly shifting geopolitical and economic landscape. It aims to foster a new era of health sovereignty rooted in national ownership, investment, and leadership.
Progress and Urgency: Why this High-Level Meeting.
Significant progress has been made in global health over recent decades: child mortality has been halved since 1990, maternal deaths have decreased by over 40% since 2000, HIV/AIDS deaths have been halved since 2010, and 1.4 billion people now enjoy healthier lives thanks to improved tobacco control, cleaner air, and better access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare.
However, these gains are at risk. Shifting geopolitics, diminished multilateralism, reduced donor funding, and emerging health threats have exposed significant structural flaws in the global health system. The current global health governance framework—designed in a different era—no longer adequately reflects today’s political, economic, or demographic realities.
Reform is now crucial; it is urgent both nationally and internationally. Countries must take greater responsibility for their health governance and funding. Globally, there is an immediate need to overhaul health governance systems.
In response, this African-led global gathering will advance multiple initiatives to mobilise global partners and global consensus to address these challenges.
Summit Deliverables
The Summit will deliberate and formally endorse The Accra Initiative. This bold, action-oriented outcome document will establish shared principles, benchmarks, and a roadmap for reforming global health governance in alignment with national priorities for health sovereignty.
Key outcomes of the Summit will include:
1. Creation of a Presidential High-Level Panel to design a roadmap for a re-imagined global health governance architecture aligned with national and international efforts.
2. Commitment to core principles of inclusivity, leadership, accountability, resilience, sustainable funding, and cross-sector collaboration.
3. Launch of the SUSTAIN Initiative to promote country-led and investment-driven health systems, powered by domestic resources, private sector engagement, philanthropic partnerships, and technical expertise.
4. Endorsement of the Accra Compact, articulating Africa’s vision for health sovereignty and a more equitable global health order.
This Summit builds on the ongoing efforts of President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and African Union institutions to improve health financing and continental health coordination. However, it also calls for urgent reform of global health governance to better reflect the realities of a changed world, where Africa’s voice and leadership must take centre stage.
The Summit follows President Mahama’s passionate speech in June 2025 at the Global Summit on Health and Prosperity in Brussels. It draws inspiration from his leadership during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, where he directed regional efforts to control the epidemic, showcasing Africa’s capacity to respond to crises with unity and determination. That same spirit of continental and global solidarity now underpins the Accra Compact.
“Africa must take charge of its health destiny—not in isolation, but through determined, coordinated action. This Summit is our moment to lead not only in financing our systems but also in reshaping the rules that govern global health—rules that must reflect the voices and realities of our people”, President John Mahama said about the Summit.

My brother, President Azali Assoumani of Comoros,
Your Excellency Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma,
Dr Sidi Ould Tah, President of BADEA,
The CEO and team of the African Prosperity Network,
Ladies and gentlemen,
It is a great honour to address this distinguished gathering of Heads of State, policymakers, and business leaders, all united by a common vision of a prosperous and self-sufficient Africa.
This conference exemplifies our shared commitment to unlocking Africa’s full potential and ensuring that the continent occupies its rightful position in the global economic landscape. The theme of African Prosperity directly addresses the aspirations of our people: an industrialised, integrated, and inclusive Africa.
AFRICA AT A CROSSROADS
Africa is at a crossroads. On the one hand, we boast immense natural wealth, a youthful and dynamic population, and growing technological advancements. On the other, we continue to grapple with economic disparities, infrastructure deficits, and structural barriers that impede our progress.
The good news is that our destiny is in our hands. Our actions today—through decisive leadership and strategic partnerships—will define the future of this continent.
TRADE AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION: THE AFCFTA OPPORTUNITY
One of the most transformative initiatives of our time is the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). With the potential to create the largest free trade area in the world, AfCFTA represents a game-changing opportunity for African businesses, entrepreneurs, and industries.
However, trade liberalisation alone is not enough. We must:
1. Invest in infrastructure to facilitate trade—efficient roads, rail networks, ports, and digital connectivity.
2. Strengthen intra-African supply chains to ensure that our industries produce goods and services that meet regional and global standards.
3. Harmonise trade policies to eliminate non-tariff barriers and reduce business costs across borders. Committing to these actions can unlock a $3.4 trillion market, creating jobs and prosperity for millions of Africans.
INDUSTRIALISATION AND VALUE ADDITION
Africa must move beyond exporting raw materials to producing finished goods. Whether it is cocoa in Ghana, oil in Nigeria, copper in Zambia, or diamonds in Botswana, we must process and add value to our natural resources.
By doing so, we will enhance our share of global trade and generate sustainable jobs for our citizens. We must ensure indigenous ownership of our natural resources. Capital and technology are at our disposal to boost our involvement in utilising our natural resources.
Governments must, therefore, work hand in hand with the private sector to drive industrialisation through:
1. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that encourage manufacturing and innovation.
2. Access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the backbone of our economies.
3. Investment in technical and vocational education to equip our youth with the skills needed for the industries of the future.
LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
The Fourth Industrial Revolution presents Africa with a golden opportunity to leapfrog traditional development models. Digital transformation can drive financial inclusion, improve public service delivery, and create new economic opportunities.
We must:
1. Expand internet access and digital infrastructure to bridge the digital divide.
2. Encourage fintech and e-commerce to facilitate trade and economic participation.
3. Invest in research and development (R&D) to support homegrown innovations. Technology can make Africa more competitive—if we embrace it strategically.
GOOD GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP
Prosperity cannot be achieved without good governance, transparency, and accountability. Investors and businesses thrive where there is stability, predictable policies, and the rule of law.
Our youth are tired and frustrated at the lack of opportunities to realise their dreams and aspirations. Our decision to embrace democratic governance was supposed to yield a dividend that would improve the lives of our people and bring prosperity to all. Unfortunately, progress has been sluggish and intangible.
To maintain the faith and trust of our citizens in democratic and constitutional governance, we must accelerate our economic growth, expand investment, and provide employment opportunities for our youth.
As leaders, we must reaffirm our commitment to Strengthening democratic institutions and ensuring free, fair, and transparent elections. We must also fight corruption, which robs our nations of resources needed for development, and promote peace and security, as economic growth is impossible in times of conflict.
A CALL TO ACTION
Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, Africa’s time is now. The decisions we make at this conference must not end in resolutions alone. We must act with urgency, determination, and a shared vision for prosperity.
Let us rise to the occasion, break down the barriers that divide us, and build a strong, self-reliant, and globally competitive Africa.
As Ghana’s first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, once said: “The forces that unite us are intrinsic and greater than the superimposed influences that keep us apart.”
Let us embrace those forces and chart a new path for Africa’s economic transformation.
Long live African unity! Long live African prosperity!
Thank you.","https://presidency.gov.gh/speech-president-jd-mahama-at-the-africa-prosperity-dialogues-2025/","01 February 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.004473"
151,"Mahama calls for consolidated long-term national development plan, echoes Nkrumah’s vision","President John Dramani Mahama on Tuesday inaugurated the 8th National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), tasking the body with creating a unified long-term national development plan that transcends political cycles.
The President invoked the legacy of Ghana’s first leader, Kwame Nkrumah, emphasising the need for a long-term vision to break free from the country’s reliance on primary commodities.
“Nearly 70 years after independence, our economy continues to rely heavily on a narrow range of primary commodities, with limited diversification and value addition,” President Mahama stated.
“This reality reflects the persistence of structural constraints that continue to hold us back—proof that, in many respects, we remain ‘prisoners of our past.'”
The President highlighted the existence of multiple long-term development frameworks, including the Ghana Beyond Aid Charter, the Ghana@100 Long-term Development Framework, and the Vision 2057 Perspective Framework.
He urged the NDPC, now chaired by Dr Nii Moi Thompson, who led the development of the 40-Year National Development Plan in 2017, to consolidate these efforts into a single, coherent plan.
“This must be done in close collaboration with Parliament and the people’s representatives,” President Mahama stressed, emphasising the importance of inclusivity and a broad national consensus.
The plan, he added, should be subject to regular review to adapt to evolving domestic and global challenges.
President Mahama underscored the significance of the NDPC’s work, noting its collaboration with the government in preparing the Coordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies, due to be presented to Parliament within two years.
“This Programme will reflect not only the vision and policy priorities of this government but also the collective aspirations of the Ghanaian people,” the President stated.
He further clarified that this Coordinated Programme would form the foundation for the next medium-term national development policy framework, guiding the operations of government ministries, departments, agencies, and local assemblies for the next four years.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-calls-for-consolidated-long-term-national-development-plan-echoes-nkrumahs-vision/","20 May 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.065606"
152,"120-Day Social Contract Task Force starts work.","President John Dramani Mahama’s 120 Days Social Contract Task Force has held its inaugural meeting following the swearing-in of the full complement of ministers of state.
Chaired by Dr Valerie Sawyerr, Senior Presidential Advisor on Governmental Affairs, the 19-member task force is to ensure that the policies outlined in the NDC Manifesto to be achieved within the first 120 days of President Mahama’s assumption of office are fulfilled.
The president noted that while some of the promises have been delivered, others required a sectoral focus and needed the ministers to be in place.
“Some of the targets were to be achieved within 90 days, while others were in 14 days like the promise to assemble a full cabinet, which has been achieved.
“Others necessarily must go with some things, for instance the removal of some taxes and rationalisation of taxes can only be in the budget because you need to do revenue measures and put those tax instruments before Parliament,” the President said.
“So, all of you are supposed to focus on your sectors and work so that we achieve all the targets that we set ourselves in the 120-day plan.”
President Mahama, referred to Task Force as the G120, and urged them to work closely with the Chairperson, to make sure that the government is faithful to the mandate given it by the people of Ghana.
He noted that the National Economic Dialogue Planning Committee and the Constitution Review Committee have started work. The president lauded the Minister for Education, Haruna Iddrisu, for setting up the National Forum on Education Committee.
“The Minister for Education, who was amongst the earliest to be sworn-in has already moved quite fast with the issue of the national education review and so for those of you who were sworn-in later look into your sector ministries and the promises that we made and then work as quickly as possible with the senior presidential advisor on governmental affairs to be able to achieve those targets we’ve set ourselves”, the President said.
The 120 days Social Contract Task Force include Dr Cassiel Ato Baah Forson, Finance Minister, John Abu Jinapor, Energy Minister, Mrs Elizabeth Ofosu Agyare, Minister for Trade, Agribusiness and Industry, Dr Dominic Akurutinga Ayine, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Hon. Haruna Iddrisu, Education Minister.
The others are Hon. Dzifa Abla Gomashie, Minister for Tourism, George Opare Addo, Minister for Youth Development, Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection, Hon. Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, Minister for Health, and Dr Abdul-Rashid Hassan Pelpuo, Minister for Labour, Jobs, and Employment.
The rest are Hon. Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah, Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Hon. Samuel Nartey George, Minister for Communication, Digital Technology and Innovation, Hon. Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, Minister for Environment, Science and Technology, Mr Prosper Bani, National Security Adviser, Mr Goosie Tanoh, Presidential Advisor on the 24-Hour Economy, Professor Francis Dodoo, Presidential Adviser, Mrs Joyce Bawah Mogtari, Presidential Adviser and Special Aide to the President and COP Kofi Boakye (Rtd.), Director of Operations at the Presidency.
Dr Valerie Sawyerr on behalf of the Team, expressed gratitude to President Mahama for the honour bestowed upon them.
“We know how seriously you take your promises to the people of Ghana. Each promise is best with deep thinking, painstaking calculation, and consideration of various permutations to ensure they are viable, doable, and sustainable,” she said.
“We will not fail you; we will not fail the people of Ghana and God be our helper,” Dr Sawyerr said.

154,"President Mahama arrives in Brussels as advocate for GAVI Vaccine Replenishment.","President John Dramani Mahama has arrived in Brussels, Belgium, as a prominent advocate and ambassador for the GAVI Alliance’s crucial vaccine replenishment efforts. President Mahama will participate in the Global Summit on Health and Prosperity through Immunisation, co-hosted by the European Union, the Gates Foundation, and the Vaccine Alliance.
The Summit aims to secure vital support for Gavi’s ambitious 2026-2030 strategy. This strategy seeks to immunise an additional 500 million children, save over 8 million lives, and protect against up to 150 disease outbreaks, delivering over $100 billion in economic benefits.
President Mahama’s presence highlights the vital role of global cooperation in providing fair access to vaccines, especially in lower-income countries. Having experienced the transformative impact of immunisation in Ghana and across Africa first-hand, President Mahama has been dedicated to advocating for a fully funded Gavi.
In 2013, he played a similar role to support the Alliance in its mission to save children’s lives and protect health by increasing immunisation. President Mahama believes that a fully funded Gavi will save millions of lives, unlock significant economic potential, and strengthen global health security.
The Global Summit provides a critical opportunity to garner renewed commitment from traditional and newer donors, highlighting the proven effectiveness and value of Gavi’s partnerships with governments, international organisations, civil society, communities, and industry leaders.
Since 2000, Gavi has reached over a billion children with life-saving vaccines, preventing more than 18.8 million deaths and generating over $250 billion in economic benefits for lower-income economies.
While in Brussels, President Mahama will also hold discussions with many leaders, including the President of the EU Council of Ministers and Bill Gates.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-arrives-in-brussels-as-advocate-for-gavi-vaccine-replenishment/","25 June 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.251232"

My few days in government have exposed a lot, and we’ve seen how the economy has been messed up. But we have hope, and with courage, we shall solve it,” he emphasised. He also called for God’s direction and protection of Rev. Dr. Ebenezer Opambuor Adarkwa Yiadom, whom he described as a courageous man of God. “I heard his prophesies, and it gives me goosebumps anytime it’s replayed. He exhibited courage even in an environment of hostility and harassment, but he stood the test of time,” the president added.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-hope-sunday-service/","19 January 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.310825"

158,"‘Nkoko Nkitinkiti’ programme launched.","President John Dramani Mahama on Wednesday unveiled the government’s flagship poultry revitalisation programme, the Nkoko Nkitinkiti, in Kumasi.
The programme, which is not just a job-creation intervention but a deliberate policy to curb the heavy importation of frozen chicken, will involve distributing three million poultry birds.
It is designed to bring poultry production directly to the doorsteps of every Ghanaian, in homes, in schools and communities across the country. Beneficiaries will receive birds, feed, and other supplies to start their poultry businesses, transforming subsistence into self-sustaining livelihoods.
Under phase one of the programme, each beneficiary will receive 50 chicks, feed support and technical guidance to ensure the survival and sustainability of the project.
President Mahama said the Nkoko Nkitinkiti initiative, another campaign promise fulfilled, is a key component of the broader Feed Ghana Programme, designed to guarantee food sovereignty and shared prosperity.
“It is with pride and a deep sense of national duty that I stand before you in this historic city of Kumasi, the birthplace of enterprise and innovation, to launch a programme that addresses the core of our national food security and inclusive growth agenda, the Nkoko Nkitinkiti Household and Backyard Poultry Production Initiative,” he said.
The initiative is a national movement, a courageous step towards restoring food self-sufficiency, strengthening household resilience and fostering sustainable livelihoods for tens of thousands of Ghanaians, especially women, youth and vulnerable families, the President added.
Mr Mahama reiterated that, for too long, Ghana’s poultry industry, which was once an active contributor to rural incomes and national nutrition, has faced structural bottlenecks such as high feed costs, limited access to improved breeds, inadequate processing capacity, and over-reliance on imports.
“In 2023 alone, Ghana spent over $350 million importing poultry products, a drain on our foreign exchange and a missed opportunity for the nation’s farmers and entrepreneurs. We must and we will reverse this trend.”
He said the time for Ghana to reclaim the pride of producing, processing and consuming what Ghanaians themselves grow is long overdue.
Under the Feed Ghana programme, the government will execute a three-pronged strategy to restore the poultry value chain from the household level to the commercial scale.
These are the Poultry Farm to Table project, Anchor Farmers, and the Agro-Growers Support Scheme, which shall have 50 carefully selected Anchor poultry farmers.
Each will receive 80,000 chicks, along with housing and logistics, to produce 4 million birds. This will boost local demand and establish a direct market between producers and processors.","https://presidency.gov.gh/nkoko-nkitinkiti-programme-launched/","13 November 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.506796"
159,"African Leaders chart course for health self-reliance amid funding cuts.","African heads of state, meeting on the sidelines of UNGA 80, on Monday, praised President John Dramani Mahama for his recent Africa Health Sovereignty Summit in Accra, recognising it as an important initiative that has revitalised continent-wide discussions on health self-sufficiency and resilience.
The praise for President Mahama’s leadership was given at a meeting of the Committee of Heads of State and Government of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).
The leaders gathered to discuss urgent issues, including major funding reductions from international partners. The United States, alone, has reportedly cut its health funding to Africa by an estimated £8 billion, along with similar cuts from European nations.
These reductions, they acknowledged, highlight both the vulnerability of Africa’s health systems and an urgent opportunity for the continent to break the cycle of dependency by prioritising domestic investment, fostering transparency, and taking ownership of its health agenda.
The meeting committed to pooling resources to establish regional drug manufacturing hubs, with an ambitious target of meeting at least 60 per cent of Africa’s pharmaceutical demand by 2040.
Drawing inspiration from India’s robust pharmaceutical sector, which has over 10,000 manufacturing companies, the leaders expressed confidence that a united African effort could not only significantly cut drug prices but also generate considerable employment opportunities across the continent.
To facilitate this vision, the leaders agreed to harmonise regulatory frameworks and engage collaboratively with institutions such as GAVI and the World Bank, which have pledged to share their extensive experiences in supply chain management and health infrastructure development.
The Africa CDC outlined its strategic efforts to strengthen the continent’s health resilience, including comprehensive training programmes, the establishment of operational centres, and the deployment of advanced surveillance systems.
These systems incorporate digital tools, extending even to rural areas, to ensure real-time connection for early detection and swift preventive action against the spread of pandemics like Mpox, Dengue Fever, Ebola, Cholera, and other communicable diseases.
President Mahama, whose ‘Accra Reset’ was instrumental in setting the stage for these renewed discussions, also highlighted Ghana’s proactive steps.
He spoke about the government’s interventions, which have uncapped the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), expanding access to healthcare, and the country’s readiness to significantly increase investments in its health sector through the ‘Big Push’ initiative starting next year.
Taking over the chair of the meeting from the Angolan President and African Union Chair, President Mahama called for increased commitment from all member states and urged more direct engagements with potential investors and donors through sustained advocacy.
A resolution was formally adopted, establishing a robust policy framework to drive this ambitious agenda, with key support from GAVI and the WHO Director General, who both committed to revisiting progress at another planned meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.","https://presidency.gov.gh/african-leaders-chart-course-for-health-self-reliance-amid-funding-cuts/","23 September 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.562247"

161,"President Mahama Unveils Road Master Plan to Transform Oti Region.","President John Dramani Mahama has stated that the Oti Region will receive its fair share of resources from the national budget to develop critical infrastructure, including roads, education and health.
Describing this as a top national priority, President Mahama mentioned in his address at a Thank You Tour durbar in Dambai, Oti Region, that these strategic investments are essential for unlocking the full economic potential of the Volta Basin and for Ghana’s overall progress.
The President made these pronouncements while addressing a vibrant durbar of Chiefs and people at the Dambai College of Education, marking the last stop of his ‘Thank You Tour’ across all 16 regions of Ghana.
He assured residents that the vital Eastern Corridor Road, a cornerstone of national transportation, would be fully completed during his tenure. President Mahama recognised that the Oti Region plays a pivotal role as a key transit zone for goods and food between the North and South.
He also announced that the completion of the Nkwanta-Kpassa-Oti Damanko stretch of the Eastern Corridor is fully secured, with contracts already signed and contractors mobilised to the site for immediate commencement.
This commitment was met with enthusiastic cheers from the appreciative audience. Beyond this, the President detailed an extensive list of other critical road projects earmarked for rapid execution. These include:
* Upgrading of Okadjakrom-Kwamekrom Road
* Upgrading of Apotoase-Atonko Road
* Upgrading of Kpassa-Tijansi Road
* Upgrading of Nkwanta-Oti Damanko Road
* Rehabilitation of Hohoe-Jasikan Road
* Rehabilitation of Hohoe-Baika-Jasikan Road
* Construction of Nkwanta-Dambai Road
A significant highlight of his address was his assurance to construct a bridge over the River Oti. President Mahama confirmed that funding for the project has been secured in the mid-year budget, pledging its commencement within the year.
“I will personally return to cut the sod for this bridge, marking the start of a new chapter for connectivity,” he declared.
President Mahama also revealed that technical costing and procurement processes are underway for additional road projects across the Kete-Krachi, Krachi Nchumuru, and Guan Districts.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-unveils-road-master-plan-to-transform-oti-region/","27 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.686491"
162,"SPEECH: President JD Mahama launches National Education Consultative Forums","Let me express my sincerest apologies on behalf of the planning committee of the forum to our stakeholders of the faith-based organisations for the unpardonable omission committed in your delayed invitation to this forum.
Although the omission was quickly remedied, you still deserve an unqualified apology for this oversight. Since you are the purveyors of God’s mercy on earth, I’m sure you are forgiving us.
Thank you very much. We know you are important stakeholders because you own some of the schools, so this educational forum is important to see how we can bring everybody together.
So today, we begin an important journey of consensus-building in an important sector: education. For many years, we’ve watched education standards decline significantly. We have, individually and collectively, expressed our views on how we believe the education sector’s problems can be addressed.
What we have lacked, however, is a unified platform on which the various shades of opinion and perspectives can be combined and distilled to yield the most optimal outcomes for our children.
In the years before my election, I indicated my desire to convene a national dialogue on the best approach to giving Ghanaian children a shot at a better life through quality and relevant education.
I committed to ensuring that all concerned about education in Ghana have an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to shaping the policies and programs that will deliver the kind of education we all want. I’m gratified that this has become a reality. I stand before you today with great pleasure and a deep sense of purpose to officially open the National Education Consultative Forum.
This moment marks a significant step in fulfilling one of the commitments of our 120-day social contract with the good people of Ghana, a commitment to build consensus on the urgent and necessary reforms needed to reset our education sector.
Education is not just a tool for personal development. It is the bedrock upon which the progress and prosperity of any nation rests. It defines the present and determines the future of our country.
Education must remain a tool for empowerment, equality, and transformation in Ghana. It is also an important instrument for social mobility. Education must inspire hope and deliver opportunity for all, whether born in Accra or the most remote part of our nation.
We recognise that the education system we inherited has not kept pace with the needs of 21st-century society and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As the world evolves, so must our education system. What worked in the past no longer suffices for the challenges and opportunities of today and tomorrow. This realisation has brought us together today. We are united in our belief that education reform is not an option but a necessity.
Ladies and gentlemen, the National Consultative Forum on Education is a platform for bringing all stakeholders together.
Governments, policymakers, teachers, students, parents, traditional leaders, religious leaders, political party representatives, development partners, and all members of civil society.
We are here because we recognise that reimagining Ghana’s education system is not a task that any single entity can undertake alone. Education reform is a shared responsibility, a collective journey that requires all voices, perspectives, and hands on deck.
This consultative process, I believe, will bring out the best solutions born out of dialogue, partnership, and mutual understanding to deal with our current and future challenges.
Our goal today is to engage in an honest and productive discussion about the current state of education in Ghana, to diagnose the challenges, and to craft a bold and actionable roadmap for reform.
Our educational system’s current challenges require strategic priorities, fresh solutions derived from objective, nonpartisan issue analysis, and a renewed sense of urgency. The moment to act together is now, and we must use this forum to answer critical questions such as: How do we ensure that every child in Ghana receives a quality education regardless of where they are born or live?
How do we equip our schools and teachers with the necessary tools and resources to provide a quality education? How do we close the gaps in foundational learning and prepare our students for further studies, the world of work, and future opportunities?
How do we ensure innovative pedagogies, inclusive, engaging, and adaptive pedagogies framed around social-emotional learning and universal design for learning, which are central to our teachers’ classroom practice?
How do we develop an assessment system that promotes critical thinking and problem-solving rather than just regurgitating what was learned? How do we restore school leaders’ autonomy against mutually agreed-upon performance standards? How do we remove excessive political interference in the governance of our education system?
How can we ensure adequate and sustainable financing for education and achieve innovative infrastructure provision at optimal cost?
How do we provide our students with the technical and vocational skills to enter the world of work? Where do we place moral education, patriotism, and family values in our curriculum?
How do we increase the role of faith-based organisations in managing their schools? We expect you to focus on these and many more questions and provide us with answers in the roadmap.
Ladies and gentlemen, the big question at the centre of the issues associated with the aforementioned questions is how to ensure the provision of a balanced education for Ghana’s children and young people, an education that transforms them into globally competitive citizens.
An education system that adequately prepares them and nurtures them as Ghanaians with uncompromising values and character qualities of honesty, creativity, and responsible citizenship, as well as 21st-century problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
An education system that ensures that our leaders, by age 10, are well-grounded and proficient in language literacy, mathematics literacy, scientific literacy, and cultural literacy as the foundation for their future learning.
As we all, as stakeholders, consider educational issues across basic, secondary, and tertiary education, we must remember that quality education not only focuses on developing pupils’ intellects but also ensures holistic personality development.
It develops his heart, mind, and hand for the benefit of himself and the larger society. The mind promotes critical thinking and creativity necessary for productive decision-making.
The heart fosters the moral, emotional, and social orientation needed to strengthen societal and family values, enhance social cohesion, and promote mutual respect.
The hand develops in learners skills and practical competencies necessary for building and strengthening our service and productive sectors of our economy. For this reason, I agree with Ellen G. White, the American author, when she says, and I quote, “Our education takes too narrow and too low a range.”
There is a need for a broader scope and a higher aim. True education means more than just pursuing a certain course of study. It means more than preparing for the life that is now. It has to do with the whole being and the whole period of existence possible to man. It means it refers to lifelong learning. It is the harmonious development of the physical and mental.
It prepares the student for the joy of service in this world. Unquote. Education must prepare our students for service.
That is our task. Finding answers to the questions above and others will inform the discourses of this forum. It must be our collective responsibility to make recommendations that are far-reaching, transformative, and necessary for developing the global Ghanaian.
This is a call to action for every stakeholder present today, every Ghanaian across the country, and every Ghanaian in the diaspora.
Their future depends on our decisions and actions today. I’m happy that some of our members, our citizens from the diaspora, like Professor Champon, have travelled to join us at this forum.
Also, Professor Benega is all the way from Australia. You are all welcome. As a government, we are fully committed to this process.
The outcomes of this conference assure you that your recommendations will not gather dust on a shelf. They will not become symbolic recommendations but form the foundation of a comprehensive reform agenda to build an inclusive, equitable, and transformative education system for Ghana and all Ghanaians.
Therefore, we will prioritise the actionable reforms proposed here, using clear timelines and measurable outcomes to guide our actions.
To build trust and transparency, the public will receive regular updates on progress. We will also increase the allocation of resources to critical areas, including foundational learning, with a focus on the four literacies I mentioned: language, mathematics, science, and culture.
Teacher education and capacity development would also receive attention. Infrastructure development and education technology were also included. There was a deepened partnership with parents, traditional authorities, and local communities. I’m happy that the Honorable Education Minister has already announced that PTAs can engage with schools.
The children at the schools are properly managed. PTAs can start to do their work by engaging with the schools to deepen their management. We should deepen partnerships with parents, traditional authorities, and local communities to support every child’s learning journey through the practice of learning teams.
To ensure that school leaders have the autonomy to perform their duties against a national school leader standard, we shall work with stakeholders, including the Conference of Heads of Assisted Secondary Schools and other teachers’ unions, to develop.
We aim to prioritise research and its evidence in decision-making. Additionally, we will continue the teacher transformation initiatives that began in 2014 under the T-TEL project, ensuring that this transformation is implemented across all sectors of the education system, including TVET.
Ladies and gentlemen, as we embark on this crucial dialogue, let us not lose sight of the bigger picture. The task before us is not merely about fixing what is broken but about constructing an education system that is fit for purpose in today’s dynamic world.
Let us envision an education system where every child, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to achieve their full potential.
Let us envision an education system where teachers are celebrated, supported, and empowered to inspire the next generation.
Let us envision an education system in which schools are the centres of innovation and learning that prepare students for not just exams but lifelong learning.
This vision must drive our discussions and decisions today and tomorrow during this forum.
Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, as I officially open this National Consultative Forum on Education, I urge each of you to approach this task with objectivity, courage, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to our nation’s future.
Let us be bold in our ideas, collaborative in our approach, and relentless in our pursuit of excellence.
Together, we can build an education system that resonates with ordinary Ghanaians’ aspirations and prepares our nation for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.
The future of this country is in our hands. Let us seize this moment and work together to create a legacy of hope, opportunity, and transformation for future generations. One resolution at a time, one transformation at a time, Ghana will win in developing this country’s young people for service.

He announced that a Board of Inquiry has been constituted to conduct transparent investigations into the cause of the tragedy.
“I want to assure the families and the nation that the Ghana Armed Forces has initiated a full and transparent investigation into the circumstances of this crash.”
President Mahama, who was addressing the nation on Thursday night, added that the government is in close touch with the bereaved families about DNA tests being conducted for identification of the bodies and final interment.
He announced that an evening of Reflections and Memorial will be held at the forecourt of the State House in honour of our departed men on Saturday.

165,"AFRICAN UNION: Mahama calls for collective action on reparations","President John Dramani Mahama has called upon his fellow heads of state to collectively act in securing justice for Africans and individuals of African descent through reparations.
Launching the African Union theme for 2025 at the ongoing 38th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union in Addis Ababa, President Mahama said pursuing justice requires stronger legal and institutional mechanisms at national, regional, and international levels.
“We must continue to advocate for stronger legal and institutional mechanisms… to ensure that justice for the historical trauma inflicted on global Africa is not just a conversation, but a reality,” he said.
The African Union is dedicating the year to efforts to address historical injustices and their lingering consequences, which have impacted generations of Africans and people of African descent. The theme is “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent through Reparations.”
The initiative, as President Mahama noted, aligns with the AU’s Agenda 2063 for an integrated, peaceful, and prosperous continent.
The initiative aims to mobilise political will, foster partnerships, engage stakeholders, elevate awareness, encourage dialogue, and bring an end to the culture of silence and denial surrounding racism and colonialism.
President Mahama stated that the Accra Reparations Conference in November 2023 reaffirmed the necessity for comprehensive reparatory justice and resulted in the establishment of stronger advocacy and policy frameworks.
He explained that achieving justice requires collaboration among European member states, regional economic communities, the global African dias
President Mahama said the devastating effects of the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, genocide, and neo-colonial exploitation have resulted in economic disparities, social inequality, systemic discrimination, and racial prejudices.
He noted that the transatlantic slave trade was one of the most heinous crimes against humanity, spanning about 400 years and forcibly displacing more than 12.5 million Africans.
For instance, President Mahama said an estimated two million Africans perished during the middle passage alone, adding that the legacy of this brutal system, along with colonialism, apartheid, genocide, and new colonial exploitation, has left deep and endurance cast on the fabric of our societies.
“The economic impact of colonialism on Africa has been profound, with the continent losing trillions of dollars in both human and material resources due to colonial exploitation,” President Mahama said.
President Mahama noted that the descendants of enslaved Africans continue to face economic disparities, social inequality, systemic discrimination, and racial prejudices.
He said addressing these challenges requires more than just acknowledging them. “It demands action. We must continue to advocate for stronger legal and institutional mechanisms at the national, regional, and international levels to ensure that justice for the historical trauma inflicted on global Africa is not just a conversation but a reality.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/african-union-mahama-calls-for-collective-action-on-reparations/","15 February 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:12.948778"
166,"Singapore, Ghana to deepen green and agribusiness partnership.","Ghana and Singapore on Wednesday discussed cooperation in sustainable development and value-added agriculture, anchoring their talks around a pioneering carbon markets agreement and plans to scale agro-processing and jobs in Ghana.
Speaking during bilateral talks with President John Dramani Mahama in Singapore, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam said, “the first Asian country to sign the implementation of a carbon credit agreement with Ghana and the first in Africa, is Singapore,” casting the deal as a platform to channel investment into low-carbon growth.
He added that “other areas of interest are agribusiness, downstream processing of products like cashew, cocoa… and we are ready and glad to pursue them together.”
President John Mahama, who is on a three-day State Visit, stated that Ghana is targeting job creation through a twin push in modern agriculture and services.
“On tackling the challenge with jobs, agribusiness has space for work and lots of employment, and we have, as part of our Reset Agenda, put a lot of focus on it,” he said.
“Ghana has more than enough arable land for farming,” he added, highlighting the Volta Economic Corridor: “We have over 2 million hectares of land along the river for development into agro-processing parks, irrigated lands, etc., and that surely will be another game changer under our Resetting Ghana and the 24-hour economy programme.”
Mahama also pointed to the “creative and digital services” economy as a rapid employer for Ghana’s youth. The sector, he said, “employs faster and creates 5 jobs easily before a job is created in the traditional job markets.”
Tharman acknowledged that “jobs are a challenge, but that’s also something you are dealing with,” he said, underscoring Singapore’s interest in helping develop SMEs alongside green and agro-industrial projects.
Mahama framed the broader partnership as part of Ghana’s role in Africa’s economic opening under the AfCFTA, while congratulating Singapore on 60 years of independence.
“We are stabilising the economy,” he said, and the next phase is to convert stability into sustainable, job-rich growth through green finance, downstream processing and digital opportunity.","https://presidency.gov.gh/singapore-ghana-to-deepen-green-and-agribusiness-partnership/","27 August 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:13.009682"

The fair is convening industry leaders, innovators, policymakers, and investors to showcase advancements and attract investment in an integrated transport and logistics system.
President Mahama described the event as a landmark initiative, not just a simple gathering, but a statement of shared resolve to transform Ghana’s transport and logistics sector.
“Transport, as everyone knows, is the lifeblood of every economy. It leads to new opportunities, opens markets for goods and services, boosts productivity, and promotes inclusive national development,” he said.
He also stressed the importance of public-private collaboration in transforming the sector, aiming to enhance the efficiency of the movement of people, goods, and services.
The President outlined clear and ambitious priorities, including the modernisation of rail, road, maritime, and aviation systems, and the enhancement of intermodal connectivity to ensure seamless passenger and freight movement across Ghana and into the wider sub-region.
Addressing climate concerns, President Mahama noted ongoing efforts to decarbonise transport, expand electric mobility infrastructure, and promote climate-smart investments to lower emissions and protect the environment.
As part of these reforms, a strong regulatory framework is being established to oversee the safe and responsible operation of motorcycles and tricycles, popularly known as ‘Okada’, ensuring fare-paying passenger services whilst extending affordable and efficient mass public transport systems.
The Ghana Transport and Logistics Fair 2025 stands as a testament to the government’s resolve to deliver a future-ready transport system, generate employment, and position Ghana as a regional leader in sustainable and innovative mobility solutions.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-reaffirms-commitment-to-technology-driven-transport-for-jobs-and-growth/","22 October 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:13.070734"
168,"President Mahama commissions the Damongo Camp Prison.","President John Dramani Mahama has commended The Church of Pentecost for assisting the Ghana Prisons Service with three modern facilities at Ejura, Nsawam, and Damongo.
The President was speaking when he commissioned a 300-capacity correctional centre built by the Church at Damango, the Savana regional capital, on Wednesday.
He said the event marks not only the opening of a correctional facility, but also the unveiling of a very powerful symbol of hope, redemption, and partnership for national renewal.
“This project demonstrates what can be achieved when the state, the Church, and the community come together in service to humanity.”
President Mahama added, “It affirms a timeless truth that nation building is not the sole responsibility of government, but a collective moral endeavour of all who believe in the inherent dignity and potential of every human being”.
He reiterated the government’s decision to expand the Ghana Prisons Service’s contribution to national development by providing logistics to undertake large-scale farming, poultry, and vegetable production as part of a wider prison reform programme.
This, he said, will not only increase food production but generate income to sustain the Service and equip inmates with practical skills for life after their incarceration.
“The Ghana Prisons Service will actively contribute to the 24-hour economy by running prison industries around the clock. This will include manufacturing, sewing school uniforms, producing furniture, agro-processing, and other goods, both for government use and for the open market,” he added.
The President announced an increase in the daily feeding allowance for inmates.
“We’ve increased the daily feeding rate for inmates from GHS 1.80 to GHS 5.00. This will provide better nutrition for those incarcerated. This is not charity, it is justice. It reflects our belief that dignity should never be dependent on one’s circumstances.”
President Mahama also announced that he would provide the Damongo Camp Prisons with a 66-seater bus to facilitate staff movement.
“On behalf of the Government and People of Ghana, I wish to express our deep gratitude to Apostle Eric Nyamekye, the Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, the leadership and members of the Church of Pentecost, for your faith in humanity, your partnership with the state, your belief in Mandela’s dictum, that ‘society’s greatness is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.”
The Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Dr Eric Nyamekye, said their primary objective is to raise disciples of Christ, who would impact their world with righteousness. He added that the Church regards the prison camps as a ‘Kingdom Project’, designed not only to save souls but also to foster the transformation of society.","https://presidency.gov.gh/president-mahama-commissions-the-damongo-camp-prison/","06 November 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:13.133743"

The Minister made the announcement when he took his turn at the Government #AccountabilitySeries, where he restated the government’s commitment to a fair and equitable recruitment process.
New recruitment guidelines, prioritising merit and set to ensure even distribution across all regions of the country, will be made public by August 2025.
Complementing the GAF expansion, the Minister also announced the upcoming launch of the National Service Emergency Response Readiness Programme. This innovative initiative will offer military training to Ten Thousand (10,000) National Service volunteers, commencing August 2025.
While participation in the National Service Emergency Response Readiness Programme is optional, Dr. Omane Boamah strongly encouraged eligible young Ghanaians to seize this unique opportunity to develop critical skills, discipline, and contribute to national preparedness.
The Minister provided updates on investigations into past recruitment scams. He reiterated President John Dramani Mahama’s directive that joining the Ghana Armed Forces will be strictly based on merit, not financial inducement.
The Minister disclosed key findings from ongoing audits and investigations:
– Investigations revealed that 34 trainees from Regular Career Course (RCC) 64, despite initially breaching enlistment procedures, were pardoned after completing a year of rigorous training.
– A total of 210 individuals across Regular Career Course (RCC) 64, RCC 65, and Short Service Commission (SSC) 62 were identified as having failed to meet essential eligibility criteria.
– The Minister confirmed that no new recruitment exercise for soldiers (non-officers) has taken place since October 2021.
– The Army Recruits Training School (ARTS) has not trained personnel for the past 17 months, and an audit further uncovered that 2,872 potential Army recruits are currently awaiting training. The Ministry is actively addressing these issues to ensure timely induction and training for qualified individuals.
The Minister for Defence warned the public against engaging with fraudsters and scammers who demand money for enlistment. All official recruitment procedures will be transparent and announced publicly through legitimate government channels.","https://presidency.gov.gh/ghana-armed-forces-set-for-major-expansion-12000-new-recruits-national-service-military-training-announced/","21 July 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:13.265465"

His commendation came after Matilda Asante Asiedu was sworn in as the Second Deputy Governor of the central bank.
President Mahama emphasised the positive signs of recovery, noting a gradual restoration of investor confidence. He highlighted the recent performance of the Ghanaian Cedi, which has appreciated by approximately 3.16% in the interbank market and about 5% in the Forex Bureau market over the last quarter.
The President also noted the moderation of inflation, indicating a significant reversal of the volatility experienced last year.
“The economy we inherited was deeply distressed. Investor confidence had plummeted, inflation was soaring, the Cedi had sharply depreciated, and our debt situation was precarious,” President Mahama stated.
He further explained how the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP) had initially strained the financial system, impacting liquidity, confidence, and stability.
He attributed the recent progress to disciplined and coordinated institutional action under Governor Dr. Johnson Asiama, his deputy, and the Bank of Ghana’s management team.
“These gains are not accidental. They are a result of careful monetary tightening, improved foreign exchange liquidity, and better synchronisation of fiscal and monetary policy frameworks,” the President noted.
Expressing confidence in the newly sworn-in Deputy Governor, Matilda Asante Asiedu, President Mahama said her expertise would complement the ongoing efforts at the Bank of Ghana.
He also highlighted the significance of the staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the fourth review of the extended credit facility programme. “This reflects growing international confidence in our reforms and the credibility of our economic governance,” he stated.
President Mahama also expressed optimism about the ongoing implementation of Public Financial Management systems by the finance minister. He anticipates that these measures, including efforts to increase domestic revenue mobilisation, streamline public expenditure, and restore fiscal discipline, will further contribute to his vision of resetting the economy, creating jobs, and improving the lives of Ghanaians.
The second deputy governor, Matilda Asante Asiedu, expressed gratitude to President Mahama for the trust placed in her and pledged her full commitment to his vision.
“To be called to serve at this level, at such a crucial moment in our nation’s economic history, is both an honour and a solemn duty, and I do not take it lightly at all,” she affirmed.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-applauds-bank-of-ghanas-recovery-swears-in-second-deputy-governor/","02 May 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:13.517533"

The President’s message was delivered during a courtesy call by a 20-member delegation from the Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference (GCBC), led by its President, Most Reverend Matthew Kwasi Gyamfi, Bishop of Sunyani.
President Mahama conveyed the condolences of the government and people of Ghana on the passing of Pope Francis, remembering him as a man deeply interested in Africa.
“I had the opportunity to meet him, and I was personally touched by his down-to-earth nature and keen interest in our continent,” the President stated. “He knew so much about Africa, and he was virtually interrogating me about it.”
Turning to the election of Pope Leo XIV, President Mahama expressed hope that the new Pontiff would “walk in the footsteps of Pope Francis.” He added, “We are happy at the quick succession and the person who has succeeded.”
He highlighted Pope Leo’s background in South America as valuable preparation for his new role.
The Catholic leaders visit served a dual purpose: to congratulate President Mahama on his decisive victory in the December 7, 2024, general election and to raise critical national issues.
Key concerns presented to the President included the escalating problem of illegal mining (“galamsey”), the ongoing education reform efforts, and broader governance and electoral reforms crucial for national development.
The Bishops’ Conference declared its support for the president’s efforts to tackle the galamsey menace, urging the government to impose a limited state of emergency in all affected zones to temporarily suspend all mining activities, deploy military engineering units for the reclamation of degraded mining areas, and restore lawful local governance.
Most Reverend Matthew Gyamfi, President of the Conference, stated that they are weighed down by the devastation caused by illegal mining, which started as a subsistence activity but has escalated into a threat of national proportions.
He noted that recent data indicate that over 4,000 hectares of the nation’s forest cover have been lost in just two years, adding that rivers such as Pra, Offin, and Ankobra have become bywords for environmental collapse due to the activities of illegal miners.
“Now, this ecological damage is grave, but the socio-moral disintegration it breeds is just as perilous. We believe we must act now and immediately, not only with force but with foresight,” Most Rev. Gyamfi said.
“Enforcement, we believe, must be balanced by credible and sustainable alternatives for those driven by desperation.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-extols-pope-leo-xiv-in-meeting-catholic-church-leaders/","25 May 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:13.585176"

Touring the 33.4-kilometre corridor, the President also instructed the contractor to strengthen traffic management to keep people and goods moving along the Accra–Kumasi highway, a critical national corridor.
“As government commits to paying you well, you too must commit to moving faster on the road and also use quality materials,” President Mahama said, warning against shoddy work.
The visit followed recent public agitation over delays attributed to unpaid arrears. Raising concerns about the project’s financing, President Mahama questioned how earlier funds were exhausted before completion.
“A loan was taken for this project. I don’t understand why the money is finished and the project is not over. We’re having to pay a supplementary amount, equivalent to almost $78 million from Government of Ghana funds,” he said.
“We need to find out what happened. Was the estimate not done properly, or what went wrong?”
He noted that, given the strategic importance of the route, which links to major cities, the northern regions and onward to Burkina Faso, the project has been placed under the government’s Big Push programme.
Briefing the President, Chief Resident Engineer Kwabena Bimpong said the project is 75% complete and on course for completion by June 2026.
Minister for Roads and Highways, Kwame Agbodza and his deputy, Alhassan Suhuyini, accompanied the President on the tour.
“We’re happy to see traffic flowing,” President Mahama added. “But one of your duties is site management to ensure your work does not impede the flow of traffic.

Presenting the report at a brief ceremony at the Presidency, the Committee’s Chair, Justice Gabriel Pwamang, said the panel conducted its work in camera, in line with Article 146(7) and (8), and refrained from public commentary despite “blatant false statements made about members of the committee and our work.”

It was the second in the series of such collaborations, the first being in Accra.
In an address before the start of the screening exercise, Mrs Mahama used the opportunity to encourage traditional and religious leaders to leverage their revered positions to foster healthy, responsible behaviour within their communities.
The First Lady noted that Ghana remains committed to ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, a goal she said is achievable if every individual plays their part.
“Parents must engage in open and honest conversations with their children about health and sexuality,” she noted, urging teachers to also guide students with care, wisdom, and accurate information to help eliminate the stigma surrounding HIV.
Currently, over 334,000 Ghanaians are living with HIV, and the Bono Region remains one of the most affected areas. This, she said, is a serious concern, and called for education, prevention, and early testing to turn the tide against infections.
According to the First Lady, who is also the President of the Lordina Foundation, health is the foundation upon which development is built. She stated that without good health, productivity suffers and affects the building of vibrant communities.
Mrs Mahama highlighted the importance of health screening programmes.
“I love bringing health services closer to people because when we invest in health, we invest in our collective future”, she said.
Osagyefo Oseadeeyo Agyeman Budu II, Dormaahene and President of the Bono Regional House of Chiefs, expressed concern over the rising HIV cases in the Bono Region in recent years, particularly affecting people aged 25 to 40.
He stated that the screening programme is a crucial health campaign rather than a political exercise, encouraging all attendees to take advantage of testing and educational resources.
Sister Diana, who has been living with HIV since 1989, shared her experience battling stigma due to limited awareness. She emphasised that with proper care and monitoring, people living with HIV can lead healthy lives.
“My children’s support gave me strength,” she said, “and motivated me to educate others as an ambassador for HIV awareness.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/first-lady-takes-health-services-to-sunyani-as-bono-region-battles-high-hiv-rates/","14 November 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:13.914957"

Speaking at an African Union Conference on Debt in Lomé, Togo, President Mahama emphasised the importance of a united African front in addressing debt challenges and advocating for fair global financial solutions.
President Mahama stated, “Ghana, under my leadership, is committed to and already rolling out policies to rebuild its fiscal buffers, strengthen institutions, and promote inclusive growth.”
He acknowledged the potential impact of fiscal adjustments on social protection programs, underscoring his government’s commitment to a transformation agenda that prioritises long-term economic stability and intergenerational progress.
“In Ghana, we are prioritising value-added agriculture, renewable energy, and digital infrastructure—all sectors that yield multiplier effects in jobs, exports, and innovation,” President Mahama explained.
He outlined the key pillars of Ghana’s ‘Reset Agenda,’ designed to achieve sustainable and inclusive development: protecting investments in education, youth empowerment, and rural development; ensuring that all Ghanaians have the opportunity to participate in and benefit from the nation’s economic progress; enhancing debt transparency through the establishment of an independent fiscal council; promoting accountability and informed decision-making in public finance management; expanding the role of the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund to attract private capital; and facilitating strategic investments in critical infrastructure to drive economic growth and create jobs.
President Mahama commended the African Union Commission for organising the High-Level Conference. He recognised the conference’s theme, “Africa’s Public Debt Management Agenda in Restoring and Safeguarding Debt Sustainability,” as a critical call to action.
“This is not just a technical theme; it is a call to confront one of the most defining challenges of our generation,” he stated.
Looking ahead to the 2025 G20 Summit, President Mahama urged African nations to forge a common position advocating for timely, fair, and transparent debt restructuring frameworks. He emphasised the necessity of standardised debt transparency benchmarks across the African Union and fostering greater accountability and comparability in debt management practices.

“Do not be intimidated because you are girls. Be confident in your abilities,” she said, noting that her visit was not only in her capacity as the First Lady and founder of the Lordina Foundation but also as an ambassador for the “Educating Linda Programme.”
The “Educating Linda Programme” is an initiative of the Merck Foundation that supports girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to stay in school and pursue their dreams.
“This programme is very close to my heart as a woman from a humble background. Education is a transformative tool that changes individuals, families, communities, and nations,” she added.
Through a partnership with the Merck Foundation, twenty exceptional girls from the St Mary’s R/C Girls Basic School have been awarded scholarships by the Lordina Foundation to pursue their education.

He reaffirmed Ghana’s commitment to ECOWAS protocols, dismissing any anxieties in Nigeria over any potential mass deportation of its citizens from Ghana following the emergence of a viral video.
Minister Odumegwu-Ojukwu conveyed the “anxieties” of the Nigerian people and government, citing the viral video, widespread apprehension of mass deportations, and fears of shops belonging to Nigerian traders being burned.
The concerns, she noted, have led to emergency sessions in Nigeria’s National Assembly and traditional rulers instructing relatives in Ghana to return home.
President Mahama acknowledged the historical relations between Ghana and Nigeria, describing them as “siblings of the same parents, and so our destinies are joined together.”
He invoked past unfortunate incidents of mass deportations in both countries—Ghana in the 1960s and Nigeria in the 1980s—, stating, “I think that that is a part of our past, and it’s an unfortunate past that we want to put behind us, and I believe that none of our two countries should mass deport our citizens ever again.”
“We are members of the ECOWAS, and we have the ECOWAS protocol that allows our citizens to travel freely between our countries.”
He also clarified that, although there have been isolated incidents and some individuals involved in criminal activity, such cases are addressed through proper legal procedures, not through collective punishment or mass expulsion. He stated that foreign residents in Ghana who engage in criminal activities shall be held individually liable and sanctioned.
President Mahama traced the recent tensions to the resurfacing of a 2013 video featuring an “Igbo king” discussing land acquisition for a kingdom, which was widely misinterpreted as a recent development.
He dismissed this as “a bit of a storm in a teacup,” assuring the Nigerian delegation that Ghanaian law governs the establishment of traditional councils, making such external claims impossible.
Minister Odumegwu-Ojukwu commended President Mahama for de-escalating a potentially volatile situation, noting that the initial fears of widespread unrest upon their arrival in Accra proved unfounded.","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-calms-nigerians-fears-no-mass-deportations-storm-in-a-teacup-over-viral-video/","03 August 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:14.165459"
185,"World faces choice between saving lives & funding bombs—Mahama.","Addressing a global health summit organised by Gavi and the Gates Foundation in Brussels on Wednesday, President John Dramani Mahama starkly contrasted military spending with the cost of saving lives through vaccination, telling attendees that the $9 billion sought by the Gavi vaccine alliance over five years is equivalent to the cost of just four B-2 Spirit bombers.
“This morning, I took time to reflect, researched and discovered that one B-2 Spirit bomber that dropped bombs on Iran recently cost $2.13 billion,” President Mahama said at the Gavi vaccine alliance pledging session. “If you work the math, Gavi seeks the value of four of those B-2 bombers. Surely, the world can invest the equivalent cost of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children.”
He framed the funding decision as a fundamental moral choice for the international community. “It’s a choice we have to make,” he declared, “between taking lives and saving lives, and I am sure we will save lives instead of taking them.”
The call for increased funding came after the President shared a deeply personal account of the impact of vaccine-preventable diseases. He spoke of his younger brother who was crippled by polio in childhood, a disability that led to long-term stigma, depression, and ultimately, his death from alcohol poisoning.
He contrasted his own childhood experience, when vaccine access in his region was scarce, with the hope that Gavi now provides to millions worldwide. “Today, Gavi has changed all that and given hope to millions of children,” he stated, adding that Gavi’s efforts allow children to grow into “responsible citizens.”
Highlighting Ghana’s partnership with Gavi, President Mahama announced that the country has achieved 97 per cent immunisation coverage, a figure with which he expressed pride. However, he acknowledged the challenge of reaching the remaining 3 per cent, approximately 65,000 children in remote areas, and voiced confidence that Gavi’s support would help find them.
As a lower-middle-income country, Ghana co-finances its vaccine programmes with Gavi. President Mahama detailed steps Ghana is taking to increase its contribution, including uncapping the national health insurance fund, which has allowed for significant allocation to vaccine financing.
He noted that Ghana has spent almost $67 million on vaccines in partnership with Gavi in recent years and has front-loaded $20 million for co-financing this year.
Looking ahead, President Mahama expressed Ghana’s ambition to fast-track its transition from receiving Gavi funding by 2030 to becoming a donor country, citing Indonesia as an example.
He concluded by thanking Gavi and the countries that had made significant pledges at the summit, endorsing the slogan, “While others step back, we step up.”
Gavi aims to raise $9 billion over the next five years (2026-2030) to immunise 500 million children globally. President Mahama argued that this effort was a crucial investment in the future, enabling children to become “tomorrow’s scientists, engineers, nurses, teachers, and doctors.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/world-faces-choice-between-saving-lives-funding-bombs-mahama/","26 June 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:14.238638"
186,"Mahama rallies Caribbean nations to support African reparations movement.","President John Dramani Mahama says Ghana will file a motion at the United Nations next year to declare slavery as one of the greatest crimes in history.
He is subsequently calling on Africans and people of African descent to join the campaign seeking justice for the legacies of colonialism, slavery, and other historical injustices through various forms of repair.
“As the African Union Champion for Reparations, I see this cause not as a plea for charity, but as a demand for justice and restoration. At the UN General Assembly this year, I sent notice that Ghana intends to file a motion at the United Nations next year to declare slavery as one of the greatest crimes against humanity.”
President Mahama was speaking at a luncheon at the Presidency, in honour of the Grenadian Prime Minister, Hon. Dickon Mitchell, during his two-day official visit to Ghana.
He said the issue of reparations for Africa and the people of African descent holds deep meaning for both Ghana and Grenada.
“Mr Prime Minister, I know I can count on your support and the support of our colleagues in the Caribbean and the African Union to support this motion.”
The President said, the African Union’s 2025 theme, “Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations”, rightly reflects a collective struggle.
“Let us build on our shared history to foster shared prosperity founded on trust, cooperation, and a deep belief in the common destiny of our peoples.”
He emphasised that Africa’s demand for reparative justice is rooted in historical truth, moral clarity, and its steadfast dedication to dignity.
Prime Minister Mitchell, who traced his roots to Ghana, said his visit reinforces the long-standing bilateral relations between what he called the two ‘Gs’- Ghana and Grenada.
He said Grenada and, by extension, the Caribbean are deeply committed.
“It is not just about economic justice. It is not just about reversing the significant negative legacy of colonisation and neocolonisation, and in some cases the imperialism that continues. But it is first and foremost about our human dignity,” Prime Minister Mitchell said.
He assured President Mahama that Grenada and the Caribbean stand ready to support the resolution.
“We stand ready to continue the conversation and the fight for the acknowledgement that slavery, the transatlantic slave trade, is, in fact, perhaps the worst human crime that has been committed against humanity. And that we should recommit to ensure that it never happens again.”","https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-rallies-caribbean-nations-to-support-african-reparations-movement/","17 October 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:14.303862"

189,"Ghana provides humanitarian support to Jamaica, Cuba and Sudan.","President John Dramani Mahama has, on behalf of the government and the people of Ghana, donated modest but heartfelt relief items worth GHS 10 million to three countries —Jamaica, Cuba, and Sudan —that have been hit by a humanitarian crisis.
The gesture responds to the destruction caused by Hurricane Melissa, a category 5 cyclone that swept through the Caribbean, affecting over 1.5 million people in Jamaica, Cuba, and other islands, as well as the heavy toll on refugee agencies tackling thousands displaced by the Sudanese conflict.
The items donated include 2,400 bags of Ghana rice, 540 bags of sugar, 377 boxes of medication, 500 mattresses, 500 pillows, 100 cartons of gari mix, and 50,000 pieces of T-shirts.
The rest are three 20-foot containers of assorted products and Ghanaian chocolate products, 20 pieces of 500-litre water tanks, 20 pieces of hand-wash stations, 10 pieces of emergency portable toilets, and assorted clothes.
President Mahama said the donation is a token of Ghana’s deep solidarity, respect, and fraternity with the affected countries.
“You can imagine the kind of devastation that it wreaked on Jamaica, and from Jamaica, it continued to Cuba. Hundreds of people have lost their lives and are still counting. Other people are missing, who have not been accounted for,” he observed.
President Mahama described the presentation as symbolic of Ghana’s friendship and goodwill in challenging times for brotherly nations, and it is in the spirit of camaraderie with the good people of Jamaica, Cuba and the Sudan.
“Sudan is actually becoming the forgotten wall because of Ukraine and Gaza. It looks like the world’s attention has shifted from there,” he said.
“Some of the atrocities, the genocide, and the humanitarian suffering that is taking place in Sudan are not something that belongs to the 21st century.”
The items donated, according to President Mahama, will be distributed in the ratio of 50% to Jamaica, 30% to Cuba, and 20% to humanitarian agencies in Sudan.
The products were donated by businesses in Ghana, including Latex Foam, Ash Form, MTN, Farm Masters Global, Twilion Company, Dignity DTRR Apparel, Pharmanova Ghana, and Atlantic Lifesciences Ltd. Others are Mancwa Commodities Ltd, Duraplast Ltd, Terraprime Group Ghana Ltd, Mid Atlantic Group, Ghana Cocoa Board, Cocoa Processing Company and Businessman Ibrahim Mahama.
The High Commissioner of Jamaica to Ghana, H.E.

190,"President Mahama receives special message from the Senegalese president.","President John Dramani Mahama on Friday received a special message from Senegal’s President Diomaye Faye, delivered by the Senegalese Minister for Pan-African Integration and Foreign Affairs, Madam Yassine Fall.
The message included an invitation for President Mahama to deliver the keynote address at a special event scheduled for September 26, 2025.
President Mahama lauded the longstanding ties between Ghana and Senegal, recalling the two nations’ leadership in advancing Pan-Africanism.
“Ghana and Senegal have been at the forefront of Pan-Africanism and anything that has to do with the African personality in the struggle,” he said. “Currently, we are the champions of reparations, and we need to continue to tell the story of how Africa was raided by countries that called themselves developed. It is on the back of Africa that they rode to become what they are. So, if genocide in the Second World War deserves reparations, slavery was far worse. More people died in slavery than during the Second World War.”
On behalf of President Faye, Madam Fall extended condolences to the President and the people of Ghana over the loss of eight citizens, including senior government officials, in the August 6, 2025, helicopter crash. She also lauded President Mahama’s sterling leadership on the continent.

191,"Ghana ready to lead Africa’s industrial renaissance – President Mahama assures as he cuts sod for Dawa Industrial Enclave Solar Park project.","President John Dramani Mahama has assured investors of Ghana’s preparedness to spearhead an industrial revolution that will not only transform its economy but also serve as a catalyst for Africa’s next phase of development.
The President was speaking at a sod-cutting ceremony for the construction of a Solar Park at Agortor in the Dawa Industrial Enclave of the Greater Accra Region.
The project, which is being executed by Solar for Industries Limited (SFI), a subsidiary of LMI Holdings Limited, will be in two phases, beginning with an initial 200 MWp installation.
The first, with a capacity of 100MWp — about 2% of Ghana’s total power supply — is expected to be completed by December 2026, while the additional 100MWp will be added to the grid after 9 months.
This is expected to be expanded to 1,000 megawatts (MWp) by 2032, making it the largest and only private utility-scale solar farm in sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa.
President Mahama, who was impressed by the company’s vision, said the Solar for Industries initiative supports a broader environmental agenda and aligns with the Blue Water Guards, the Tree for Life Reforestation Programme, and the Clean Ghana Campaign.
“This is how development should work, one project generating many opportunities,” he noted. The president added that the project symbolises the growing investor confidence in Ghana and that the ongoing reforms by his government are aimed at ensuring a win-win situation for both Ghana and businesses.
“Let us build this project with integrity, speed, and purpose, so that when we return here to commission it, we can all say with pride that this is the dawn of Ghana’s clean industrial revolution.”
He observed that Ghana’s long-term energy vision is founded on three pillars: sovereignty, sustainability, and the security of supply. “Sovereignty involves generating more of our energy locally and using the sun, wind, and water provided by nature to do so.”
He continued, “As we pursue industrial growth, we must also restore our natural heritage. Our rivers must run clear, our forests must regenerate, and our communities must breathe clean and fresh air.”
President Mahama observed that such initiatives are already transforming Ghana, emphasising that the SFI project is not just a power plant but a message that Ghana is prepared to lead the next phase of Africa’s industrial renaissance, energised by the sun, propelled by innovation, and upheld by their collective determination.
“As we cut the sod, let us remember that every light that shines from this Solar Park will illuminate not just the factories and homes, but the aspirations of millions of Ghanaians whose dreams rely on energy and power,”
Mr Kojo Aduhene, the Chief Executive Officer of Quarm Investments, announced that upon completion of the project, industries located in the Dawa Industrial Enclave taking power from them would enjoy a 10% discount.
He said the project demonstrates and supports an opportunity in the 24-Hour Economy, aligns with industrialisation, and shows the world that Ghana is very much open for business.
The project implementing partners include the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, Enclave Power Company, John Murphy Construction (JMC), China International Water and Electric Corp (CIWE) and SgurrEnergy.","https://presidency.gov.gh/ghana-ready-to-lead-africas-industrial-renaissance-president-mahama-assures-as-he-cuts-sod-for-dawa-industrial-enclave-solar-park-project/","06 November 2025","2025-12-05T19:45:14.639864"
