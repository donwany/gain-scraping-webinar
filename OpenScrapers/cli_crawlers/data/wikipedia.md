December 2: Readers in the United States deserve an explanation. 
Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Tuesday, December 2, and if you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75. 
Wikipedia's been around since 2001. Back then, it was just a wildly ambitious, probably impossible dream. But it came together piece by piece—created by people, not machines. Wikipedia's not perfect, but it's always been free thanks to everyday readers. 
Only 2% ever donate. But that small group makes a big difference. When you support Wikipedia, you're standing up for the internet we were promised, where knowledge belongs to everyone. 
If you agree, then this is your moment to give back. Even $2.75 makes a difference. Help keep it going—for you, for the next reader, and for the next generation. 
25 years of the internet at its **best**

A [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model "Large language model") (LLM) is a type of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model#Conceptual_model "Model") designed for [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing") tasks such as language [generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence "Generative artificial intelligence"). LLMs are [language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model "Language model") with many parameters, and are trained with [self-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning "Self-supervised learning") on a vast amount of text.

## Notes
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_large_language_models&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Notes")]
  1. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models#cite_ref-1 "Jump up")** This is the date that documentation describing the model's architecture was first released.
  2. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models#cite_ref-2 "Jump up")** In many cases, researchers release or report on multiple versions of a model having different sizes. In these cases, the size of the largest model is listed here.
  3. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models#cite_ref-3 "Jump up")** This is the license of the pre-trained model weights. In almost all cases the training code itself is open-source or can be easily replicated. LLMs may be licensed differently from the chatbots that use them; for the licenses of chatbots, see [List of chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chatbots "List of chatbots").
  4. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models#cite_ref-50 "Jump up")** The smaller models including 66B are publicly available, while the 175B model is available on request.
  5. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models#cite_ref-63 "Jump up")** Facebook's license and distribution scheme restricted access to approved researchers, but the model weights were leaked and became widely available.
  6. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models#cite_ref-65 "Jump up")** As stated in Technical report: "Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method ..."[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models#cite_note-GPT4Tech-64)
