      "        \"content\": \"Your Excellencies,\\nDistinguished Heads of State and Government,\\nI am here for the Accra Reset, a global South-anchored platform.\\nAllow me to begin by conveying special greetings from H.E. John Dramani Mahama, President of the Republic of Ghana, and African Union Champion for Reparations, the African Union\\u2019s continental theme for this year. He is also spearheading Accra Reset. President Mahama extends his deep appreciation to H.E. President Cyril Ramaphosa, whose leadership has guided this G20 cycle with clarity, courage, and profound commitment to justice.\\nCongratulations are due to South Africa and the African Union for their exceptional representation of the aspirations of Africa, Global Africa, and the wider Global South. This Johannesburg Summit has been defined by integrity of purpose, a clear focus on structural reform, and an unwavering commitment to ensure that the G20 delivers progress for all peoples and not just a privileged few.\\nWe also acknowledge several important highlights of this year\\u2019s Presidency:\\n\\u2013 the advancement of a more equitable global financial architecture;\\n\\u2013 the strong emphasis on global health resilience and manufacturing sovereignty;\\n\\u2013 the renewed momentum around digital public infrastructure and fair technology partnerships;\\n\\u2013 the focus on inclusive growth and decent jobs; and\\n\\u2013 the widening of Global South participation in multilateral decision-making.\\nYour Excellencies, these priorities resonate profoundly with the mission that several of your governments helped shape over the last three years. I speak of the Accra Reset, a Global South\\u2013anchored ambition to transform development cooperation into a system that is country-led, regionally empowered, and globally coherent.|\\nToday, on this historic platform, we humbly request continued cooperation between the G20, the South African Presidency, the African Union, and the Accra Reset.\\nWe are pleased to announce that, as of this month:\\n\\u2013 the interim Secretariat of the Accra Reset has formally commenced operations in Ghana;\\n\\u2013 the Circle of Leaders has expanded to include more than two dozen former Heads of State and Heads of International Organisations from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the Caribbean;\\n\\u2013 a High-Level Panel is being convened to prepare a landmark report on restructuring global governance, to be submitted to a commissioning authority composed of Heads of State from across both the Global North and Global South.\\nThese developments speak to a simple truth: we are entering a moment in world affairs when durable solutions must be co-created, not imposed; negotiated with fairness, not inherited from history; and built on sovereignty, dignity, common security and shared prosperity.\\nThe Accra Reset stands ready to work closely with the G20. It is poised to serve as the connective tissue interlinking the public, private, and civil factions of Global South societies. It aims to work through the African Union and the South African Presidency to advance ongoing G20-enabled reforms in health governance, digital cooperation, development finance, investments with guarantees and assurance for investor, jobs for youth, wealth creation and resilient supply chains.\\nOur history of AID and loans has created an economy of dependency. To move forward, we must re-architect our economies based on trade and investment. We see this cooperation not as a parallel track, but as a strategic reinforcement of the agenda in finance and financial architecture championed in Leaders Declaration of 2025 G20 Summit in South Africa, mindful of inadequacy of AID which is drying up and borrowing which has become counterproductive for human capital development in Global Africa.\\nYour Excellencies,\\nOn behalf of the interim Presidential Council, the Circle of Leaders, and the global coalition behind the Accra Reset, I express profound gratitude to President Ramaphosa, and all G20 members for the opportunity to mark the beginning of a new partnership between the G20 and the Accra Reset.\\nWe stand ready to work, and to do so with humility, discipline, and unwavering resolve, to help shape a workable multilateral order for finance for development and for investment for this generation and the next. Through our collective efforts, we shall transition the international development system from endless aspirational targets to workable business models that drive real and durable change and collaboration for mutual interest.\\nThank you for listening.\",\n",

Mrs Lordina Dramani Mahama, was in Sunyani on Thursday to organise a community health screening exercise in collaboration with the Ghana AIDS Commission.\\nIt was the second in the series of such collaborations, the first being in Accra.\\nIn an address before the start of the screening exercise, Mrs Mahama used the opportunity to encourage traditional and religious leaders to leverage their revered positions to foster healthy, responsible behaviour within their communities.\\nThe First Lady noted that Ghana remains committed to ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, a goal she said is achievable if every individual plays their part.\\n\\u201cParents must engage in open and honest conversations with their children about health and sexuality,\\u201d she noted, urging teachers to also guide students with care, wisdom, and accurate information to help eliminate the stigma surrounding HIV.\\nCurrently, over 334,000 Ghanaians are living with HIV, and the Bono Region remains one of the most affected areas. This, she said, is a serious concern, and called for education, prevention, and early testing to turn the tide against infections.\\nAccording to the First Lady, who is also the President of the Lordina Foundation, health is the foundation upon which development is built. She stated that without good health, productivity suffers and affects the building of vibrant communities.\\nMrs Mahama highlighted the importance of health screening programmes.\\n\\u201cI love bringing health services closer to people because when we invest in health, we invest in our collective future\\u201d, she said.\\nOsagyefo Oseadeeyo Agyeman Budu II, Dormaahene and President of the Bono Regional House of Chiefs, expressed concern over the rising HIV cases in the Bono Region in recent years, particularly affecting people aged 25 to 40.\\nHe stated that the screening programme is a crucial health campaign rather than a political exercise, encouraging all attendees to take advantage of testing and educational resources.\\nSister Diana, who has been living with HIV since 1989, shared her experience battling stigma due to limited awareness. She emphasised that with proper care and monitoring, people living with HIV can lead healthy lives.\\n\\u201cMy children\\u2019s support gave me strength,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand motivated me to educate others as an ambassador for HIV awareness.\\u201d\",\n",
