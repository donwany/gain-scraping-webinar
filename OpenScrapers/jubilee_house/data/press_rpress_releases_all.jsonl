It is a privilege to open my State Visit to Singapore here at the 8th Africa\u2011Singapore Business Forum.\nThis is my very first engagement in Singapore over the next three days, and there could be no better place to start than in the company of the builders of prosperity\u2014our entrepreneurs, investors, innovators and policymakers who turn ideas into jobs and growth.\nI thank Minister Grace for her warm welcome and insightful remarks, and I appreciate the leadership of the Chairman and the entire team at Enterprise Singapore in bringing together this platform.\nOver the next three days, I look forward to constructive meetings with Prime Minister Wong and President Tharman, I look forward to instructive industry roundtables and site visits, and to deepening our understanding of Singapore\u2019s remarkable journey\u2014your excellence in logistics and ports, your discipline in public administration, your remarkable devotion to a sustainable environment, and your success in cultivating skills and innovation.\nWe are here to learn, to partner, and to deliver.\nThe theme\u2014Bridging Capabilities, Charting Sustainable Growth\u2014speaks to a partnership that is both urgent and full of promise. We live in a rapidly changing world. The post-Cold War world ushered in the era of globalisation.\nIt sparked much excitement about the endless possibilities open to mankind to create prosperity for most of the world\u2019s population. The cheers and backslapping that celebrated the MDGs, which pulled 1 billion of the world\u2019s people out of poverty, are becoming just a pleasant memory of the past.\nThe death knell of multilateralism is sounding. Global relations are becoming more transactional. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs are flying fast and furious. The effects on the global economy are still to be well understood.\nIn these unpredictable times, we must forge new alliances and open new opportunities and possibilities. We must explore new markets and new investment spaces.\nIn a world of tightened financial conditions, fragile supply chains and rising protectionism, South\u2013South collaboration is not optional; it is essential. Africa and Singapore must be champions of open markets, trusted rules and practical partnerships that deliver jobs, technology transfer and shared prosperity.\nAfrica and Asia are the two youngest, fastest\u2011urbanising regions in the world. We are complementary in resources, markets and know\u2011how. And the numbers tell a clear story: Africa\u2011Singapore trade rose by about 50 per cent between 2020 and 2024 to nearly US$14 billion, with West Africa accounting for more than half of that.\nGhana\u2011Singapore trade has also grown, reaching over US$215 million in 2024.\nI speak today as an African leader and as President of Ghana. Our message is simple: Africa is investable, and Ghana is your reliable gateway to the continent. The continent is the world\u2019s most dynamic emerging market.\nWe are 1.4 billion people today\u2014young, fast-urbanising, digitally connected\u2014and by 2030, Africa\u2019s cities will host more than 700 million consumers.\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area is the largest new free trade area in the world by number of countries, and this has created a $3.4 trillion market and lowered barriers across supply chains.\nAfrica holds vast renewable energy potential and is already a global leader in mobile money and fintech adoption. This is a market ready for scaled solutions. Yet this opportunity must be matched with capital at the right price and with the right instruments.\nAs the African Union Champion on Financial Institutions, I must be candid: the current global financial architecture remains inequitable for low- and middle-income countries.\nAfrica faces an annual financing gap estimated at $1.3 trillion. Infrastructure needs alone run between $181 and $221 billion per year through 2030, and the climate finance gap is about $213 billion annually.\nWe are taking steps to build an African financial system that works for Africa; accelerate the African Monetary Institute as a precursor to the African Central Bank, and link ten (10) major stock exchanges through the African Exchanges Linkage Project to enhance liquidity.\nWe are also scaling the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System to enable businesses to settle cross-border trade in local currencies. This is where Singapore\u2019s strengths can be catalytic.\nSingapore stands at the nexus of global finance, fintech, logistics and green innovation.\nYour excellence in project preparation, blended finance, risk management, standards and dispute resolution is precisely what African projects need to move from pipeline to bankable to build.\nAs host of the African Continental Free Trade Area Secretariat, Ghana sits at the heart of the US$3.4 trillion single market. Through ECOWAS, we connect you to more than 400 million consumers in West Africa.\nWe offer political stability, a rules\u2011based environment, a double taxation agreement with Singapore in force since 2019, and a growing base of Singaporean investors\u201469 companies registered with cumulative investments exceeding US$2 billion.\nGhana is, therefore, a trusted entry point to scale across the continent. We know credibility is earned. We are pursuing a deliberate national reset: stabilising the macroeconomy, restoring confidence and reforming how we do business.\nInflation is easing, the cedi has stabilised, and ratings outlooks are improving.\nWe are simplifying regulations through our Business Regulatory Reforms, and we are reviewing our Investment Promotion Act\u2014including the removal of minimum capital thresholds for foreign investors\u2014to make it easier and faster to partner, whether through joint ventures or wholly\u2011owned investments.\nThe Ghana Investment Promotion Centre now provides sector\u2011specific, region\u2011by\u2011region opportunity maps to help investors make decisions based on credible data.\nOur economic strategy is anchored in productivity, exports and jobs. We call it the 24\u2011Hour Economy\u2014for a reason. Ghana is OPEN FOR BUSINESS 24 hours a day.\nWe are aligning infrastructure, incentives, and skills so factories, farms, ports, and service centres can operate round-the-clock shifts safely and competitively. At the core of this is the Volta Economic Corridor\u2014our most ambitious integrated development to date.\nThe Volta Corridor has four pillars:\nGrow24: irrigating more than two million hectares for year\u2011round farming.\nMake24: agro\u2011industrial parks for textiles, pharmaceuticals and food processing.\nShow24: tourism and hospitality along one of the world\u2019s great inland lakes.\nConnect24: transforming Lake Volta into a cost\u2011efficient inland transport spine, reducing logistics costs and linking farms, factories and markets.\nWe are complementing this with catalytic projects\u2014the Legon Pharmaceutical Innovation Park, the Kumasi Machinery and Technology Park, the Akosombo\u2011Juapong Garments and Textiles Park, Digital TVET Centres of Excellence, and renewable energy corridors.\nOur Big Push Infrastructure programme will accelerate roads, power and digital connectivity to crowd\u2011in private capital and unlock scale.\nSingapore\u2019s strengths align perfectly with Africa\u2019s and Ghana\u2019s priorities.\nAllow me to propose five practical pillars where we can bridge capabilities and chart shared growth:\n1. Efficient, green supply chains: Partner with Ghana to modernise ports, inland waterways and cold chains. Your world\u2011class logistics and standards can reduce Africa\u2019s trade costs and unlock export competitiveness.\n2. Agribusiness and food systems: From precision irrigation to processing and packaging, Singaporean tecnology and African scale can turn our farms into reliable suppliers for Asia, the Middle East and Europe.\n3. Clean energy and carbon markets: Ghana and Singapore signed an Article 6 Implementation Agreement in 2024. We have established a Carbon Markets Office and Ghana Carbon Registry, anchored in new environmental legislation, to ensure transparency and alignment with international standards. Invest with us in renewable energy, waste\u2011to\u2011energy, regenerative agriculture and forestry. Generate high\u2011integrity credits while delivering jobs, clean air and resilience.\n4. Digital economy and services: Build with us on e\u2011payments, cybersecurity, digital ID and smart government. Create BPO and shared\u2011service hubs to serve Africa from Accra, 24/7.\n5. Advanced manufacturing and critical minerals: Ghana has strong manganese output and significant lithium potential, alongside graphite, gold, copper and rare earth prospects. Our policy is value addition at home\u2014battery precursors, components and downstream manufacturing\u2014powered by clean energy and world\u2011class standards.\nEnterprise Singapore has been an outstanding partner in building these bridges, helping Ghanaian firms access Asian markets and enabling Singaporean champions to succeed in Ghana.\nWe deeply appreciate this.\nTogether, we can scale what works\u2014project preparation, blended finance, guarantee instruments, and SME matchmaking\u2014so that more deals move from MoUs to operations.\nTo the business leaders in this room, I want to extend a special invitation. On day three of this State Visit, as part of the Africa Forum, we will host a Presidential Business Roundtable.\nJoin us. Bring your teams. Put Ghana\u2019s readiness to the test. We will showcase bankable projects, provide direct access to our regulators, outline incentives for strategic investors and offer a one\u2011stop investor concierge so decisions can be made quickly and confidently.\nOur proposition is straightforward:\n\u2013 A stable, reform\u2011minded country, connected to the AfCFTA, designed for scale.\n\u2013 A 24\u2011Hour Economy that matches your need for speed, reliability and standards.\n\u2013 A pipeline of investable projects in agribusiness, logistics, manufacturing, energy, digital and tourism.\n\u2013 A partner that values integrity, predictability and long\u2011term relationships.\nIn return, Ghana and Africa ask for what Singapore does best: practical collaboration, technology transfer, disciplined project execution, blended finance, and a shared commitment to skills development.\nWhen Singaporean and African firms collaborate, we will create jobs for our youth, diversify global supply chains, and drive growth in sustainability.\nThank you.", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/speech-presidents-keynote-to-open-the-8th-africa-singapore-business-forum/"}, {"title": "Mahama extols Pope Leo XIV in meeting Catholic Church leaders.", "date": "25 May 2025", "content": "President John Dramani Mahama has extended his congratulations to Pope Leo XIV on his election as the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

It aims to foster a new era of health sovereignty rooted in national ownership, investment, and leadership.\nProgress and Urgency: Why this High-Level Meeting.\nSignificant progress has been made in global health over recent decades: child mortality has been halved since 1990, maternal deaths have decreased by over 40% since 2000, HIV/AIDS deaths have been halved since 2010, and 1.4 billion people now enjoy healthier lives thanks to improved tobacco control, cleaner air, and better access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare.\nHowever, these gains are at risk. Shifting geopolitics, diminished multilateralism, reduced donor funding, and emerging health threats have exposed significant structural flaws in the global health system. The current global health governance framework\u2014designed in a different era\u2014no longer adequately reflects today\u2019s political, economic, or demographic realities.\nReform is now crucial; it is urgent both nationally and internationally. Countries must take greater responsibility for their health governance and funding. Globally, there is an immediate need to overhaul health governance systems.\nIn response, this African-led global gathering will advance multiple initiatives to mobilise global partners and global consensus to address these challenges.\nSummit Deliverables\nThe Summit will deliberate and formally endorse The Accra Initiative. This bold, action-oriented outcome document will establish shared principles, benchmarks, and a roadmap for reforming global health governance in alignment with national priorities for health sovereignty.\nKey outcomes of the Summit will include:\n1. Creation of a Presidential High-Level Panel to design a roadmap for a re-imagined global health governance architecture aligned with national and international efforts.\n2. Commitment to core principles of inclusivity, leadership, accountability, resilience, sustainable funding, and cross-sector collaboration.\n3. Launch of the SUSTAIN Initiative to promote country-led and investment-driven health systems, powered by domestic resources, private sector engagement, philanthropic partnerships, and technical expertise.\n4. Endorsement of the Accra Compact, articulating Africa\u2019s vision for health sovereignty and a more equitable global health order.\nThis Summit builds on the ongoing efforts of President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and African Union institutions to improve health financing and continental health coordination. However, it also calls for urgent reform of global health governance to better reflect the realities of a changed world, where Africa\u2019s voice and leadership must take centre stage.\nThe Summit follows President Mahama\u2019s passionate speech in June 2025 at the Global Summit on Health and Prosperity in Brussels. It draws inspiration from his leadership during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, where he directed regional efforts to control the epidemic, showcasing Africa\u2019s capacity to respond to crises with unity and determination. That same spirit of continental and global solidarity now underpins the Accra Compact.\n\u201cAfrica must take charge of its health destiny\u2014not in isolation, but through determined, coordinated action. This Summit is our moment to lead not only in financing our systems but also in reshaping the rules that govern global health\u2014rules that must reflect the voices and realities of our people\u201d, President John Mahama said about the Summit.\nSIGNED.\nFelix Kwakye Ofosu (MP)\nSpokesperson to the President & Minister, Government Communications.", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/statement-african-health-sovereignty-in-a-reimagined-global-health-governance-architecture-a-co%e2%80%91creation-summit-under-the-leadership-of-his-excellency-john-dramani-mahama-president-of-the/"}, {"title": "Mahama hosts Heads of State Dialogue on financing African investments.", "date": "17 February 2025", "content": "President John Dramani Mahama has urged African nations to enhance domestic resource mobilisation to reduce reliance on external funding and to foster sustainable economic growth.\nSpeaking at a \u201cHeads of State and Government Breakfast Dialogue\u201d during the African Union (AU) Summit, Mahama emphasised the continent\u2019s resilience in the face of ongoing challenges, forecasting a growth recovery of 3.7 per cent in 2024 and 4.03 per cent in 2025.\n\u201cThis optimistic outlook underscores the robust nature of our economies and the success of our policy interventions,\u201d stated President Mahama, the African Union\u2019s Champion for Financial Institutions.

Structural transformation remains uneven, with many economies reliant on low-productivity sectors,\u201d he noted.\nHe emphasised the urgency of addressing a challenging financing gap estimated at approximately $402 billion annually until 2030.\n\u201cThis gap is more than just a figure; it signifies the unrealised aspirations of countless Africans whose hopes for a better future hinge on our capacity to invest wisely in crucial areas like infrastructure, education, technology, and health.\u201d\nIn addition to financial constraints, Mahama pointed out other challenges, including climate issues, geopolitical tensions, and potential disruptions from diseases and pandemics. He stressed the importance of strategic investments in critical sectors and acknowledged the substantial financing gap needed to support these initiatives.\nTo bridge this gap, Mahama proposed a multifaceted strategy that encompasses strengthening domestic resource mobilization, improving tax administration, and mitigating illicit financial flows. He underscored the vital role of African multilateral financial institutions in supporting sustainable development and urged strengthening their capacity to advance Africa\u2019s Agenda 2063.\n\u201cThe establishment of institutions like the African Central Bank, African Investment Bank, African Monetary Fund, and the Pan African Stock Exchange is crucial for fostering necessary investments,\u201d he stated.\n\u201cIt is imperative for African countries to expedite the rollout of these institutions and leverage our collective strengths to fill the financing and investment voids.\u201d\nThe president also envisioned a unified, prosperous, and peaceful Africa, affirming that such a vision is attainable if African nations effectively mobilise resources, reform financial systems, and invest in their populations.\nDr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO\u2019s Director General, echoed President Mahama\u2019s sentiment, urging African leaders to curtail borrowing and seek innovative methods for attracting and retaining investments.\n\u201cWe need to capitalise on investments flowing into Africa and ensure their sustainability for our development,\u201d she noted, suggesting strategies such as enhancing the value added to natural resources and utilising pension funds to raise long-term capital.\nThe event also featured a high-level panel discussion focused on strategies for mobilising African finance to meet the objectives of Agenda 2063, reinforcing the dialogue\u2019s commitment to achieving sustainable development across the continent.", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-hosts-heads-of-state-dialogue-on-financing-african-investments/"}, {"title": "Government supports Kantamanto market fire victims with GH\u00a2 1m", "date": "23 January 2025", "content": "The Chief of Staff, Julius Debrah, has presented one million Ghana cedis to the Katamanto Traders Association to support victims of a devastating fire that ravaged the market earlier this year.\nThe presentation fulfills a pledge President John Dramani Mahama made during a meeting with the association shortly after his assumption of office.\nMr. Debrah expressed the government\u2019s sympathy for the traders\u2019 losses and indicated the government\u2019s readiness to facilitate the engagement of all stakeholders in redesigning the market into a modern, multi-purpose facility to prevent future disasters.\n\u201cThere is hope.

Instead, he advocated for health as a vital investment and the \u201cengine of productivity,\u201d essential for the continent\u2019s inclusive growth.\nSpeaking at a high-profile Accra Health Sovereignty Summit in Accra, President Mahama called for a fundamental shift away from dependence on donor support for health infrastructure.\nHe advocated for a \u201cnew multilateralism,\u201d grounded in co-creation and mutual respect, rather than extraction or charity.\n\u201cThe outdated notion that health drains our economies must be rejected,\u201d President Mahama declared in his keynote address. \u201cIn truth, health is the engine of productivity and the bedrock of inclusive growth.\u201d\nTo underscore his point, the President cited World Health Organisation (WHO) research indicating that every $1 invested in health resilience yields up to $4 in returns. He emphasised that this return is even greater in Africa, given its youthful populations and \u201clatent economic dynamism.\u201d\n\u201cEvery malaria case prevented is a day of work regained. Every maternal death avoided is a family stabilised. Every vaccinated child is a future secured,\u201d he stated, illustrating the tangible economic and social benefits of health investment.\nPresident Mahama, who convened the Accra Meeting, urged economists across the continent to revise national accounts to reflect health as a productivity multiplier rather than a mere consumption expense. He implored Ministers of Finance to treat health as a capital investment.\nTo achieve this paradigm shift, he outlined a three-pronged strategy:\n1. Globally: Championing a new health governance architecture that reflects a multipolar, digitally interconnected, and climate-challenged world.\n2. Regionally: Scaling up homegrown solutions.\n3. Nationally: Demonstrating the political will to mobilise funds and promote good governance fit for 21st-century realities, moving beyond mere plans.\nSuccess, he observed, would hinge on scaling innovations such as PANABIOS for data health verification and pandemic preparedness, PROPER for transparent medical supply chains, and BIONOVAC to transform vaccine production from molecule to market.\n\u201cIn Ghana, we have not stood still,\u201d noted. The President announced the \u201cuncapping\u201d of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) financing, effectively opening up approximately 3.5 billion cedis more in fiscal space for broader and deeper health coverage.\nHe also referred to the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares), designed to mobilise public, private, and philanthropic capital to tackle chronic disease burdens like hypertension, diabetes, and kidney failure.\nThe President announced plans to launch a national Primary Healthcare Programme in the coming months, which will come along with the recruitment of community health volunteers. These initiatives, he noted, represent a significant step forward in preventive care, aimed at improving the general health and wellness of citizens.\nThe high-profile Africa Health Sovereignty Summit attracted a remarkable group of leaders and experts, including former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former Mauritius President Dr Ameenah Firdaus Gurib-Fakim, and the Director-General of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nThe summit convened health professionals from across the continent and the diaspora, global experts, non-profit organisations, investors, donors, and students, all committed to advancing health equity and sovereignty in Africa.", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/mahama-challenges-african-leaders-health-is-economic-engine-not-drain/"}, {"title": "Mahama courts Singapore investors, touts 24-hour economy as gateway to $3.4 trillion AfCFTA market", "date": "26 August 2025", "content": "President John Dramani Mahama on Tuesday used the opening of the 8th Africa\u2013Singapore Business Forum to pitch Ghana as a \u201creliable gateway\u201d to the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), calling Africa \u201cinvestable\u201d and urging deeper South\u2013South partnerships amid a more fragmented global economy.\n\u201cWe are here to learn, to partner, and to deliver,\u201d President Mahama said at his first engagement on a three-day state visit to Singapore. \u201cAfrica is investable, and Ghana is your reliable gateway to the continent.\u201d\nFraming Africa and Asia as the world\u2019s \u201ctwo youngest, fastest\u2011urbanising regions,\u201d Mahama said the pair are complementary in resources, markets and know\u2011how, and should be \u201cchampions of open markets, trusted rules and practical partnerships that deliver jobs, technology transfer and shared prosperity.\u201d\nPresident Mahama also warned that \u201cthe death knell of multilateralism is sounding\u201d as tariffs proliferate and supply chains remain fragile, arguing that tighter global financial conditions demand new alliances.\nHe, however, insisted the fundamentals in Africa are compelling: a 1.4 billion\u2011strong population that is young and digitally connected; a $3.4 trillion single market under the AfCFTA; and leadership in mobile money and fintech adoption.\nTrade ties are already deepening. Mahama noted Africa\u2013Singapore trade climbed about 50% between 2020 and 2024 to nearly $14 billion, with West Africa accounting for more than half. Ghana\u2013Singapore trade reached more than $215 million in 2024, while 69 Singaporean companies are registered in Ghana with cumulative investments exceeding $2 billion.\nPositioning Ghana as a continental launchpad, Mahama pointed to Accra\u2019s role as host of the AfCFTA Secretariat and to the country\u2019s access to more than 400 million consumers through ECOWAS. \u201cGhana is, therefore, a trusted entry point to scale across the continent,\u201d he said.\nHe also outlined a slate of domestic reforms and flagship projects intended to sharpen Ghana\u2019s competitiveness and absorb more capital.\n\u201cGhana is OPEN FOR BUSINESS 24 hours a day,\u201d Mahama said, describing his national strategy to align infrastructure, incentives and skills so factories, farms, ports and service centres can run round\u2011the\u2011clock shifts safely and competitively.\nHe also touted his four integrated pillars \u2014 Grow24 (irrigating more than 2 million hectares for year-round farming), Make24 (agro-industrial parks for textiles, pharmaceuticals, and food processing), Show24 (tourism along Lake Volta), and Connect24 (turning Lake Volta into an inland transport spine to cut logistics costs).\nMahama said inflation is easing, the cedi has stabilised, and ratings outlooks are improving. The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre now offers sector\u2011specific, region\u2011by\u2011region opportunity maps to guide decisions with \u201ccredible data.\u201d\nHe cast Singapore as a catalytic partner for Africa across finance, logistics and technology. \u201cYour excellence in project preparation, blended finance, risk management, standards and dispute resolution is precisely what African projects need to move from pipeline to bankable to build,\u201d he told the audience, which included Singapore\u2019s Ministers, trade officials and corporate leaders.\nThe president also used the platform to press for reforms to the global financial architecture and to highlight Africa\u2019s homegrown integration efforts.

It remains timeless even today.\u201d\nDespite these historical ambitions, President Mahama acknowledged the challenges that have hindered progress. Citing the 2024 National Annual Progress Report by the NDPC, he revealed that over $70 billion in cost overruns have been recorded across 18,000 capital projects, with many facing significant delays or abandonment.\nHe candidly admitted, \u201cWe must reflect on the painful truth that, despite our ambition, infrastructure delivery has often been fragmented, politicised, and inefficient.

Today, we reaffirm this framework as essential for national transformation.\u201d\nHe concluded with a rallying call: \u201cLet us not just build roads and bridges, but a Ghana that works for everyone and where vision meets discipline, and where continuity, transparency, and innovation illuminate the path to a shared future.\u201d", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/president-launches-ambitious-ghana-infrastructure-plan-a-renewed-vision-for-devt-through-2057/"}, {"title": "African Leaders chart course for health self-reliance amid funding cuts.", "date": "23 September 2025", "content": "African heads of state, meeting on the sidelines of UNGA 80, on Monday, praised President John Dramani Mahama for his recent Africa Health Sovereignty Summit in Accra, recognising it as an important initiative that has revitalised continent-wide discussions on health self-sufficiency and resilience.\nThe praise for President Mahama\u2019s leadership was given at a meeting of the Committee of Heads of State and Government of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).\nThe leaders gathered to discuss urgent issues, including major funding reductions from international partners. The United States, alone, has reportedly cut its health funding to Africa by an estimated \u00a38 billion, along with similar cuts from European nations.\nThese reductions, they acknowledged, highlight both the vulnerability of Africa\u2019s health systems and an urgent opportunity for the continent to break the cycle of dependency by prioritising domestic investment, fostering transparency, and taking ownership of its health agenda.\nThe meeting committed to pooling resources to establish regional drug manufacturing hubs, with an ambitious target of meeting at least 60 per cent of Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical demand by 2040.\nDrawing inspiration from India\u2019s robust pharmaceutical sector, which has over 10,000 manufacturing companies, the leaders expressed confidence that a united African effort could not only significantly cut drug prices but also generate considerable employment opportunities across the continent.\nTo facilitate this vision, the leaders agreed to harmonise regulatory frameworks and engage collaboratively with institutions such as GAVI and the World Bank, which have pledged to share their extensive experiences in supply chain management and health infrastructure development.\nThe Africa CDC outlined its strategic efforts to strengthen the continent\u2019s health resilience, including comprehensive training programmes, the establishment of operational centres, and the deployment of advanced surveillance systems.\nThese systems incorporate digital tools, extending even to rural areas, to ensure real-time connection for early detection and swift preventive action against the spread of pandemics like Mpox, Dengue Fever, Ebola, Cholera, and other communicable diseases.\nPresident Mahama, whose \u2018Accra Reset\u2019 was instrumental in setting the stage for these renewed discussions, also highlighted Ghana\u2019s proactive steps.\nHe spoke about the government\u2019s interventions, which have uncapped the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), expanding access to healthcare, and the country\u2019s readiness to significantly increase investments in its health sector through the \u2018Big Push\u2019 initiative starting next year.\nTaking over the chair of the meeting from the Angolan President and African Union Chair, President Mahama called for increased commitment from all member states and urged more direct engagements with potential investors and donors through sustained advocacy.\nA resolution was formally adopted, establishing a robust policy framework to drive this ambitious agenda, with key support from GAVI and the WHO Director General, who both committed to revisiting progress at another planned meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/african-leaders-chart-course-for-health-self-reliance-amid-funding-cuts/"}, {"title": "37-member NDPC inaugurated", "date": "20 May 2025", "content": "President John Dramani Mahama has inaugurated the 37-member Eighth National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), tasking them with creating a long-term development plan that transcends political cycles and guides Ghana\u2019s progress for generations.\nMahama urged the NDPC to deliver a \u201cbold and transformative path\u201d for the nation, empowering Ghanaians to overcome past limitations.\nEstablished under the 1992 Constitution and governed by Acts 479 and 480, the NDPC is responsible for preparing national development plans, monitoring government programs, and advising the President and Parliament.\nThe President emphasised the importance of broad consultation with citizens in fulfilling this mandate.

Nearly 47% of Ghanaian exporters report encountering significant trade obstacles, with non-tariff measures and procedural delays comprising the majority of these challenges.\nOver 52% of complaints relate to costly and time-consuming technical regulations imposed by multiple, poorly coordinated agencies. An exporter may need as many as 16 different documents to obtain a Certificate of Origin alone.\nThe Ghana Standards Authority, tasked with safeguarding quality, is often under-resourced.\nAt the same time, the absence of accredited local laboratories forces exporters to rely on\nforeign testing facilities, raising costs and causing unnecessary delays.\nAt our ports, overlapping inspections, prolonged clearance times, and unofficial fees pose significant burdens for exporters. According to the International Trade Centre, these inefficiencies cost Ghana up to $4.3 billion in lost export revenue each year.\nIn our fisheries sector, repeated alerts from the European Union about hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination have led to temporary bans, causing significant reputational damage.\nAlarmingly, women and small and medium enterprises\u2014a vital source of innovation and resilience\u2014account for less than 4% of Ghana\u2019s exporting firms. These figures are not just statistics; they represent lost jobs, missed opportunities, and delayed prosperity. We must and will correct this.\nStrategic Pathways for Export Transformation.\nThis is why the AEDAC has been established: to provide a high-level platform for strategic coordination, policy coherence, and institutional accountability in our export development efforts.\nOur strategy is both ambitious and deliberate. Under the Accelerated Export Development Programme (AEDAC) and the National Export Development Strategy, we aim to grow Ghana\u2019s non-traditional export earnings from $3.5 billion annually to at least $10 billion by 2030.\nTo achieve this, we will prioritise value addition and economic diversification. Ghana\u2019s current exports are still dominated by low-complexity raw materials\u2014gold, cocoa, cashew, and timber.\nWe rank 110th out of 133 countries on the Global Economic Complexity Index. This situation must change. We will support our private sector partners in investing in agro-processing and light manufacturing.\nIn the textile industry, where 75% of inputs are still imported, we must act decisively to harness the potential of a $6 billion regional market. Ghana has the capacity to significantly boost our garment exports throughout Africa and to the world.\nThrough targeted incentives and strategic partnerships, we will enhance local production and participation in this value chain.\nOur 24-hour Economy Strategy will complement this ambition by developing focused value\nchains\u2014cassava, tomato, palm oil, pharmaceuticals, textiles and garments, and industrial\nmachinery. With effective implementation, we are confident that by 2034, Ghana can reduce\nthe national unemployment rate from 14.7% to under 5%.\nInfrastructure and Trade Facilitation.\nNo export strategy can succeed without strong logistics and trade infrastructure. Ghana\u2019s exporters encounter some of the highest logistics costs in West Africa, and our export clearance times surpass regional averages.\nWe will therefore modernise our ports, revamp the Volta Lake Transport Company, develop the Mpakadan port, operationalise the Boankra Inland Port, and expand cold chain infrastructure to support our fisheries and horticultural sectors. These interventions are critical for improving transportation and reducing spoilage, particularly for producers located inland.\nWe will implement a digitised export processing system, establish transparent border management protocols, and introduce fast-track inspections to enhance efficiency and trust in our trade ecosystem.\nLeveraging AfCFTA and Global Opportunities.\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offers Ghana an unprecedented platform for growth. With access to a market of 1.2 billion people and a combined GDP of $3.4 trillion, Ghana must position itself as a regional hub for manufacturing and exports.\nAs host of the AfCFTA Secretariat, Ghana must not only participate but also lead. In 2024, we certified 19 companies under the AfCFTA\u2019s Rules of Origin framework. In 2025, we will triple this number and expand readiness training for youth- and women-led businesses to enable them to trade competitively across the continent.\nAt the same time, we are diversifying our markets beyond Africa\u2014toward Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America\u2014while consolidating our longstanding trade partnerships with Europe and North America. Ghana\u2019s future exports will not only include physical goods but also digital services, creative content, and knowledge-based products.\nHuman Capital, Technology, and SME Empowerment.\nTo compete globally, we must equip our people. We will pursue reforms in vocational and\ntechnical education, aligning curricula with the needs of agro-processing, pharmaceuticals,\ntextile manufacturing, and industrial fabrication.\nThrough programmes like the 24-Hour Economy, the Adwumawura Programme, the 1 million Youth in Coding and bespoke projects under the Youth Employment Agency (YEA), we will provide Ghanaian youth with relevant skills for modern industry.\nOur MSMEs will receive support through technical assistance, expedited certification processes aligned with global standards, and access to digital market platforms. By offering targeted R&D incentives and scale-up grants, we will empower Ghanaian enterprises to integrate into global value chains.\nWe will also create a predictable and robust incentive regime\u2014including performance-based tax rebates\u2014to drive mass local production and exports of Made-in-Ghana products. Energy reliability will be prioritised through an innovative energy mix strategy\u2014including solar, biogas, natural gas, micro-grid turbines, and embedded industrial solutions. Water infrastructure will be expanded to facilitate year-round industrial productivity and export performance.\nA New National Export Compact.\nThe global trade environment is evolving. Protectionism is on the rise, and competition is intensifying. We must respond with vision, unity, and determination. The AEDAC will collaborate closely with the private sector, development partners, academia, and regional institutions to dismantle barriers, identify new export opportunities, and drive coordinated reform.\nSupported by the 24H+ Secretariat, AEDAC will collaborate with GEPA, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and related agencies to ensure Ghana transitions decisively from vision to implementation\u2014from potential to performance.\nConclusion: The Ghana We Envision.\nLet us act with purpose and urgency. Let us build a Ghana that earns more than it borrows, a Ghana that processes more than it exports raw materials, a Ghana that creates jobs through competitive exports, not slogans.\nTo the distinguished members of the Accelerated Export Development Advisory Committee\u2014\nthank you for accepting this national responsibility. Your work will help shape Ghana\u2019s future.\nMay your service be impactful.\nMay your wisdom guide us.\nAnd may God bless our dear Republic of Ghana.", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/speech-launch-of-the-president-accelerated-export-development-advisory-committee/"}, {"title": "SPEECH: President JD Mahama launches National Education Consultative Forums", "date": "18 February 2025", "content": "Let me express my sincerest apologies on behalf of the planning committee of the forum to our stakeholders of the faith-based organisations for the unpardonable omission committed in your delayed invitation to this forum.\nAlthough the omission was quickly remedied, you still deserve an unqualified apology for this oversight. Since you are the purveyors of God\u2019s mercy on earth, I\u2019m sure you are forgiving us.\nThank you very much. We know you are important stakeholders because you own some of the schools, so this educational forum is important to see how we can bring everybody together.\nSo today, we begin an important journey of consensus-building in an important sector: education. For many years, we\u2019ve watched education standards decline significantly. We have, individually and collectively, expressed our views on how we believe the education sector\u2019s problems can be addressed.\nWhat we have lacked, however, is a unified platform on which the various shades of opinion and perspectives can be combined and distilled to yield the most optimal outcomes for our children.\nIn the years before my election, I indicated my desire to convene a national dialogue on the best approach to giving Ghanaian children a shot at a better life through quality and relevant education.\nI committed to ensuring that all concerned about education in Ghana have an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to shaping the policies and programs that will deliver the kind of education we all want. I\u2019m gratified that this has become a reality. I stand before you today with great pleasure and a deep sense of purpose to officially open the National Education Consultative Forum.\nThis moment marks a significant step in fulfilling one of the commitments of our 120-day social contract with the good people of Ghana, a commitment to build consensus on the urgent and necessary reforms needed to reset our education sector.\nEducation is not just a tool for personal development. It is the bedrock upon which the progress and prosperity of any nation rests. It defines the present and determines the future of our country.\nEducation must remain a tool for empowerment, equality, and transformation in Ghana. It is also an important instrument for social mobility. Education must inspire hope and deliver opportunity for all, whether born in Accra or the most remote part of our nation.\nWe recognise that the education system we inherited has not kept pace with the needs of 21st-century society and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. As the world evolves, so must our education system. What worked in the past no longer suffices for the challenges and opportunities of today and tomorrow. This realisation has brought us together today. We are united in our belief that education reform is not an option but a necessity.\nLadies and gentlemen, the National Consultative Forum on Education is a platform for bringing all stakeholders together.\nGovernments, policymakers, teachers, students, parents, traditional leaders, religious leaders, political party representatives, development partners, and all members of civil society.\nWe are here because we recognise that reimagining Ghana\u2019s education system is not a task that any single entity can undertake alone. Education reform is a shared responsibility, a collective journey that requires all voices, perspectives, and hands on deck.\nThis consultative process, I believe, will bring out the best solutions born out of dialogue, partnership, and mutual understanding to deal with our current and future challenges.\nOur goal today is to engage in an honest and productive discussion about the current state of education in Ghana, to diagnose the challenges, and to craft a bold and actionable roadmap for reform.\nOur educational system\u2019s current challenges require strategic priorities, fresh solutions derived from objective, nonpartisan issue analysis, and a renewed sense of urgency. The moment to act together is now, and we must use this forum to answer critical questions such as: How do we ensure that every child in Ghana receives a quality education regardless of where they are born or live?\nHow do we equip our schools and teachers with the necessary tools and resources to provide a quality education? How do we close the gaps in foundational learning and prepare our students for further studies, the world of work, and future opportunities?\nHow do we ensure innovative pedagogies, inclusive, engaging, and adaptive pedagogies framed around social-emotional learning and universal design for learning, which are central to our teachers\u2019 classroom practice?\nHow do we develop an assessment system that promotes critical thinking and problem-solving rather than just regurgitating what was learned? How do we restore school leaders\u2019 autonomy against mutually agreed-upon performance standards? How do we remove excessive political interference in the governance of our education system?\nHow can we ensure adequate and sustainable financing for education and achieve innovative infrastructure provision at optimal cost?\nHow do we provide our students with the technical and vocational skills to enter the world of work? Where do we place moral education, patriotism, and family values in our curriculum?\nHow do we increase the role of faith-based organisations in managing their schools? We expect you to focus on these and many more questions and provide us with answers in the roadmap.\nLadies and gentlemen, the big question at the centre of the issues associated with the aforementioned questions is how to ensure the provision of a balanced education for Ghana\u2019s children and young people, an education that transforms them into globally competitive citizens.\nAn education system that adequately prepares them and nurtures them as Ghanaians with uncompromising values and character qualities of honesty, creativity, and responsible citizenship, as well as 21st-century problem-solving and critical thinking skills.\nAn education system that ensures that our leaders, by age 10, are well-grounded and proficient in language literacy, mathematics literacy, scientific literacy, and cultural literacy as the foundation for their future learning.\nAs we all, as stakeholders, consider educational issues across basic, secondary, and tertiary education, we must remember that quality education not only focuses on developing pupils\u2019 intellects but also ensures holistic personality development.\nIt develops his heart, mind, and hand for the benefit of himself and the larger society. The mind promotes critical thinking and creativity necessary for productive decision-making.\nThe heart fosters the moral, emotional, and social orientation needed to strengthen societal and family values, enhance social cohesion, and promote mutual respect.\nThe hand develops in learners skills and practical competencies necessary for building and strengthening our service and productive sectors of our economy. For this reason, I agree with Ellen G. White, the American author, when she says, and I quote, \u201cOur education takes too narrow and too low a range.\u201d\nThere is a need for a broader scope and a higher aim. True education means more than just pursuing a certain course of study. It means more than preparing for the life that is now. It has to do with the whole being and the whole period of existence possible to man. It means it refers to lifelong learning. It is the harmonious development of the physical and mental.\nIt prepares the student for the joy of service in this world. Unquote. Education must prepare our students for service.\nThat is our task. Finding answers to the questions above and others will inform the discourses of this forum. It must be our collective responsibility to make recommendations that are far-reaching, transformative, and necessary for developing the global Ghanaian.\nThis is a call to action for every stakeholder present today, every Ghanaian across the country, and every Ghanaian in the diaspora.\nTheir future depends on our decisions and actions today. I\u2019m happy that some of our members, our citizens from the diaspora, like Professor Champon, have travelled to join us at this forum.\nAlso, Professor Benega is all the way from Australia. You are all welcome. As a government, we are fully committed to this process.\nThe outcomes of this conference assure you that your recommendations will not gather dust on a shelf. They will not become symbolic recommendations but form the foundation of a comprehensive reform agenda to build an inclusive, equitable, and transformative education system for Ghana and all Ghanaians.\nTherefore, we will prioritise the actionable reforms proposed here, using clear timelines and measurable outcomes to guide our actions.\nTo build trust and transparency, the public will receive regular updates on progress. We will also increase the allocation of resources to critical areas, including foundational learning, with a focus on the four literacies I mentioned: language, mathematics, science, and culture.\nTeacher education and capacity development would also receive attention. Infrastructure development and education technology were also included. There was a deepened partnership with parents, traditional authorities, and local communities. I\u2019m happy that the Honorable Education Minister has already announced that PTAs can engage with schools.\nThe children at the schools are properly managed. PTAs can start to do their work by engaging with the schools to deepen their management. We should deepen partnerships with parents, traditional authorities, and local communities to support every child\u2019s learning journey through the practice of learning teams.\nTo ensure that school leaders have the autonomy to perform their duties against a national school leader standard, we shall work with stakeholders, including the Conference of Heads of Assisted Secondary Schools and other teachers\u2019 unions, to develop.\nWe aim to prioritise research and its evidence in decision-making. Additionally, we will continue the teacher transformation initiatives that began in 2014 under the T-TEL project, ensuring that this transformation is implemented across all sectors of the education system, including TVET.\nLadies and gentlemen, as we embark on this crucial dialogue, let us not lose sight of the bigger picture. The task before us is not merely about fixing what is broken but about constructing an education system that is fit for purpose in today\u2019s dynamic world.\nLet us envision an education system where every child, regardless of their background, has the opportunity to achieve their full potential.\nLet us envision an education system where teachers are celebrated, supported, and empowered to inspire the next generation.\nLet us envision an education system in which schools are the centres of innovation and learning that prepare students for not just exams but lifelong learning.\nThis vision must drive our discussions and decisions today and tomorrow during this forum.\nDistinguished ladies and gentlemen, as I officially open this National Consultative Forum on Education, I urge each of you to approach this task with objectivity, courage, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to our nation\u2019s future.\nLet us be bold in our ideas, collaborative in our approach, and relentless in our pursuit of excellence.\nTogether, we can build an education system that resonates with ordinary Ghanaians\u2019 aspirations and prepares our nation for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.\nThe future of this country is in our hands. Let us seize this moment and work together to create a legacy of hope, opportunity, and transformation for future generations. One resolution at a time, one transformation at a time, Ghana will win in developing this country\u2019s young people for service.\nThank you.", "link": "https://presidency.gov.gh/speech-president-jd-mahama-launches-national-education-consultative-forums/"}, {"title": "King Mswati III of Eswatini in Ghana for a State Visit next week", "date": "19 June 2025", "content": "The Presidency has announced that President John Dramani Mahama will host His Majesty King Mswati III, Ingwenyama of the Kingdom of Eswatini, for a state visit to Ghana next week.

And we\u2019ve experienced several peaceful changes of government from one party to another, all of which have occurred smoothly.\u201d\nOn the economic front, President Mahama stated that Ghana\u2019s economy is recovering rapidly, a direct result of bold fiscal and monetary policies underpinned by robust governance principles. He noted the appreciation of the Ghana Cedi by approximately 42% and a sharp decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, with the government targeting single-digit inflation in the coming months.\nThe President acknowledged that investor confidence had waned in the past due to governance challenges and weakened institutions. However, he reassured Mr. Soros that his administration is committed to non-interference in corruption-related cases and has instituted strict disciplinary measures for all appointees.\n\u201cThere was a lot of corruption and a lack of accountability. So, we came in with a comprehensive programme to strengthen anti-corruption institutions,\u201d President Mahama explained, referencing the \u201cOperation Recover All the Loot (ORAL),\u201d a major initiative to recover state assets.\n\u201cYou will continue to hear of prosecutions and other measures against individuals who have mismanaged public resources, as we steadfastly pursue accountability.\u201d\nAddressing the delicate relations with the three Sahelian countries \u2013 Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger \u2013 President Mahama assured Mr. Soros of positive progress in ongoing efforts to reunite the sub-region.

The theme of African Prosperity directly addresses the aspirations of our people: an industrialised, integrated, and inclusive Africa.\nAFRICA AT A CROSSROADS\nAfrica is at a crossroads. On the one hand, we boast immense natural wealth, a youthful and dynamic population, and growing technological advancements. On the other, we continue to grapple with economic disparities, infrastructure deficits, and structural barriers that impede our progress.\nThe good news is that our destiny is in our hands. Our actions today\u2014through decisive leadership and strategic partnerships\u2014will define the future of this continent.\nTRADE AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION: THE AFCFTA OPPORTUNITY\nOne of the most transformative initiatives of our time is the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). With the potential to create the largest free trade area in the world, AfCFTA represents a game-changing opportunity for African businesses, entrepreneurs, and industries.\nHowever, trade liberalisation alone is not enough. We must:\n1. Invest in infrastructure to facilitate trade\u2014efficient roads, rail networks, ports, and digital connectivity.\n2. Strengthen intra-African supply chains to ensure that our industries produce goods and services that meet regional and global standards.\n3. Harmonise trade policies to eliminate non-tariff barriers and reduce business costs across borders. Committing to these actions can unlock a $3.4 trillion market, creating jobs and prosperity for millions of Africans.\nINDUSTRIALISATION AND VALUE ADDITION\nAfrica must move beyond exporting raw materials to producing finished goods. Whether it is cocoa in Ghana, oil in Nigeria, copper in Zambia, or diamonds in Botswana, we must process and add value to our natural resources.\nBy doing so, we will enhance our share of global trade and generate sustainable jobs for our citizens. We must ensure indigenous ownership of our natural resources. Capital and technology are at our disposal to boost our involvement in utilising our natural resources.\nGovernments must, therefore, work hand in hand with the private sector to drive industrialisation through:\n1. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that encourage manufacturing and innovation.\n2. Access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the backbone of our economies.\n3. Investment in technical and vocational education to equip our youth with the skills needed for the industries of the future.\nLEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution presents Africa with a golden opportunity to leapfrog traditional development models. Digital transformation can drive financial inclusion, improve public service delivery, and create new economic opportunities.\nWe must:\n1. Expand internet access and digital infrastructure to bridge the digital divide.\n2. Encourage fintech and e-commerce to facilitate trade and economic participation.\n3. Invest in research and development (R&D) to support homegrown innovations. Technology can make Africa more competitive\u2014if we embrace it strategically.\nGOOD GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP\nProsperity cannot be achieved without good governance, transparency, and accountability. Investors and businesses thrive where there is stability, predictable policies, and the rule of law.\nOur youth are tired and frustrated at the lack of opportunities to realise their dreams and aspirations. Our decision to embrace democratic governance was supposed to yield a dividend that would improve the lives of our people and bring prosperity to all. Unfortunately, progress has been sluggish and intangible.\nTo maintain the faith and trust of our citizens in democratic and constitutional governance, we must accelerate our economic growth, expand investment, and provide employment opportunities for our youth.\nAs leaders, we must reaffirm our commitment to Strengthening democratic institutions and ensuring free, fair, and transparent elections. We must also fight corruption, which robs our nations of resources needed for development, and promote peace and security, as economic growth is impossible in times of conflict.\nA CALL TO ACTION\nYour Excellencies, distinguished guests, Africa\u2019s time is now. The decisions we make at this conference must not end in resolutions alone. We must act with urgency, determination, and a shared vision for prosperity.\nLet us rise to the occasion, break down the barriers that divide us, and build a strong, self-reliant, and globally competitive Africa.\nAs Ghana\u2019s first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, once said: \u201cThe forces that unite us are intrinsic and greater than the superimposed influences that keep us apart.\u201d\nLet us embrace those forces and chart a new path for Africa\u2019s economic transformation.\nLong live African unity!
