        "content": "Her Excellency the First Lady, Mrs. Lordina Dramani Mahama, has encouraged pupils of St Mary’s Basic and Junior High School at Korle Gonno in Accra to be confident and not deterred by societal stereotypes against girls.\nShe shared the encouraging message during a visit to the school on Thursday, when she presented essential learning materials to support the pupils. Mrs Mahama emphasised the importance of education and self-belief for girls.\n“Do not be intimidated because you are girls. Be confident in your abilities,” she said, noting that her visit was not only in her capacity as the First Lady and founder of the Lordina Foundation but also as an ambassador for the “Educating Linda Programme.”\nThe “Educating Linda Programme” is an initiative of the Merck Foundation that supports girls from disadvantaged backgrounds to stay in school and pursue their dreams.\n“This programme is very close to my heart as a woman from a humble background. Education is a transformative tool that changes individuals, families, communities, and nations,” she added.\nThrough a partnership with the Merck Foundation, twenty exceptional girls from the St Mary’s R/C Girls Basic School have been awarded scholarships by the Lordina Foundation to pursue their education.\nThe First Lady presented various school supplies, including exercise books, water bottles, pencil holders, rulers, pencils, erasers, sharpeners, pens, and coloured pencils, to enhance their learning experience.\nHeadmistress of the school, Patience Addy, thanked the Merck and Lordina Foundations for the support, noting that the scholarships have motivated the girls to excel academically.\nShe mentioned that the presence and encouragement of the First Lady would significantly boost their confidence and motivate them to aim higher.\nThe Circuit Supervisor from the Greater Accra Metro Education Office, Martha Breh, who accompanied the delegation, praised the generous donation and remarked that the initiative would inspire the girls to pursue their dreams with resolve.\nMiss Emelia Mensah, a scholarship beneficiary, expressed profound gratitude for the support. She shared that the scholarship relieved her of the financial burden of school supplies, enabling her to focus fully on her studies.",

        "content": "First Lady, H.E. Mrs Lordina Dramani Mahama, was in Sunyani on Thursday to organise a community health screening exercise in collaboration with the Ghana AIDS Commission.\nIt was the second in the series of such collaborations, the first being in Accra.\nIn an address before the start of the screening exercise, Mrs Mahama used the opportunity to encourage traditional and religious leaders to leverage their revered positions to foster healthy, responsible behaviour within their communities.\nThe First Lady noted that Ghana remains committed to ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, a goal she said is achievable if every individual plays their part.\n“Parents must engage in open and honest conversations with their children about health and sexuality,” she noted, urging teachers to also guide students with care, wisdom, and accurate information to help eliminate the stigma surrounding HIV.\nCurrently, over 334,000 Ghanaians are living with HIV, and the Bono Region remains one of the most affected areas. This, she said, is a serious concern, and called for education, prevention, and early testing to turn the tide against infections.\nAccording to the First Lady, who is also the President of the Lordina Foundation, health is the foundation upon which development is built. She stated that without good health, productivity suffers and affects the building of vibrant communities.\nMrs Mahama highlighted the importance of health screening programmes.\n“I love bringing health services closer to people because when we invest in health, we invest in our collective future”, she said.\nOsagyefo Oseadeeyo Agyeman Budu II, Dormaahene and President of the Bono Regional House of Chiefs, expressed concern over the rising HIV cases in the Bono Region in recent years, particularly affecting people aged 25 to 40.\nHe stated that the screening programme is a crucial health campaign rather than a political exercise, encouraging all attendees to take advantage of testing and educational resources.\nSister Diana, who has been living with HIV since 1989, shared her experience battling stigma due to limited awareness. She emphasised that with proper care and monitoring, people living with HIV can lead healthy lives.\n“My children’s support gave me strength,” she said, “and motivated me to educate others as an ambassador for HIV awareness.”",

        "content": "President John Dramani Mahama on Wednesday unveiled the government’s flagship poultry revitalisation programme, the Nkoko Nkitinkiti, in Kumasi.\nThe programme, which is not just a job-creation intervention but a deliberate policy to curb the heavy importation of frozen chicken, will involve distributing three million poultry birds.\nIt is designed to bring poultry production directly to the doorsteps of every Ghanaian, in homes, in schools and communities across the country. Beneficiaries will receive birds, feed, and other supplies to start their poultry businesses, transforming subsistence into self-sustaining livelihoods.\nUnder phase one of the programme, each beneficiary will receive 50 chicks, feed support and technical guidance to ensure the survival and sustainability of the project.\nPresident Mahama said the Nkoko Nkitinkiti initiative, another campaign promise fulfilled, is a key component of the broader Feed Ghana Programme, designed to guarantee food sovereignty and shared prosperity.\n“It is with pride and a deep sense of national duty that I stand before you in this historic city of Kumasi, the birthplace of enterprise and innovation, to launch a programme that addresses the core of our national food security and inclusive growth agenda, the Nkoko Nkitinkiti Household and Backyard Poultry Production Initiative,” he said.\nThe initiative is a national movement, a courageous step towards restoring food self-sufficiency, strengthening household resilience and fostering sustainable livelihoods for tens of thousands of Ghanaians, especially women, youth and vulnerable families, the President added.\nMr Mahama reiterated that, for too long, Ghana’s poultry industry, which was once an active contributor to rural incomes and national nutrition, has faced structural bottlenecks such as high feed costs, limited access to improved breeds, inadequate processing capacity, and over-reliance on imports.\n“In 2023 alone, Ghana spent over $350 million importing poultry products, a drain on our foreign exchange and a missed opportunity for the nation’s farmers and entrepreneurs. We must and we will reverse this trend.”\nHe said the time for Ghana to reclaim the pride of producing, processing and consuming what Ghanaians themselves grow is long overdue.\nUnder the Feed Ghana programme, the government will execute a three-pronged strategy to restore the poultry value chain from the household level to the commercial scale.\nThese are the Poultry Farm to Table project, Anchor Farmers, and the Agro-Growers Support Scheme, which shall have 50 carefully selected Anchor poultry farmers.\nEach will receive 80,000 chicks, along with housing and logistics, to produce 4 million birds. This will boost local demand and establish a direct market between producers and processors.",

Hundreds of people have lost their lives and are still counting. Other people are missing, who have not been accounted for,” he observed.\nPresident Mahama described the presentation as symbolic of Ghana’s friendship and goodwill in challenging times for brotherly nations, and it is in the spirit of camaraderie with the good people of Jamaica, Cuba and the Sudan.\n“Sudan is actually becoming the forgotten wall because of Ukraine and Gaza. It looks like the world’s attention has shifted from there,” he said.\n“Some of the atrocities, the genocide, and the humanitarian suffering that is taking place in Sudan are not something that belongs to the 21st century.”\nThe items donated, according to President Mahama, will be distributed in the ratio of 50% to Jamaica, 30% to Cuba, and 20% to humanitarian agencies in Sudan.\nThe products were donated by businesses in Ghana, including Latex Foam, Ash Form, MTN, Farm Masters Global, Twilion Company, Dignity DTRR Apparel, Pharmanova Ghana, and Atlantic Lifesciences Ltd. Others are Mancwa Commodities Ltd, Duraplast Ltd, Terraprime Group Ghana Ltd, Mid Atlantic Group, Ghana Cocoa Board, Cocoa Processing Company and Businessman Ibrahim Mahama.\nThe High Commissioner of Jamaica to Ghana, H.E. Lincoln George Downer, who received the items on behalf of the three nations, expressed gratitude to President Mahama and the Government and People of Ghana.",

        "content": "President John Dramani Mahama has assured investors of Ghana’s preparedness to spearhead an industrial revolution that will not only transform its economy but also serve as a catalyst for Africa’s next phase of development.\nThe President was speaking at a sod-cutting ceremony for the construction of a Solar Park at Agortor in the Dawa Industrial Enclave of the Greater Accra Region.\nThe project, which is being executed by Solar for Industries Limited (SFI), a subsidiary of LMI Holdings Limited, will be in two phases, beginning with an initial 200 MWp installation.\nThe first, with a capacity of 100MWp — about 2% of Ghana’s total power supply — is expected to be completed by December 2026, while the additional 100MWp will be added to the grid after 9 months.\nThis is expected to be expanded to 1,000 megawatts (MWp) by 2032, making it the largest and only private utility-scale solar farm in sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa.\nPresident Mahama, who was impressed by the company’s vision, said the Solar for Industries initiative supports a broader environmental agenda and aligns with the Blue Water Guards, the Tree for Life Reforestation Programme, and the Clean Ghana Campaign.\n“This is how development should work, one project generating many opportunities,” he noted. The president added that the project symbolises the growing investor confidence in Ghana and that the ongoing reforms by his government are aimed at ensuring a win-win situation for both Ghana and businesses.\n“Let us build this project with integrity, speed, and purpose, so that when we return here to commission it, we can all say with pride that this is the dawn of Ghana’s clean industrial revolution.”\nHe observed that Ghana’s long-term energy vision is founded on three pillars: sovereignty, sustainability, and the security of supply. “Sovereignty involves generating more of our energy locally and using the sun, wind, and water provided by nature to do so.”\nHe continued, “As we pursue industrial growth, we must also restore our natural heritage. Our rivers must run clear, our forests must regenerate, and our communities must breathe clean and fresh air.”\nPresident Mahama observed that such initiatives are already transforming Ghana, emphasising that the SFI project is not just a power plant but a message that Ghana is prepared to lead the next phase of Africa’s industrial renaissance, energised by the sun, propelled by innovation, and upheld by their collective determination.\n“As we cut the sod, let us remember that every light that shines from this Solar Park will illuminate not just the factories and homes, but the aspirations of millions of Ghanaians whose dreams rely on energy and power,”\nMr Kojo Aduhene, the Chief Executive Officer of Quarm Investments, announced that upon completion of the project, industries located in the Dawa Industrial Enclave taking power from them would enjoy a 10% discount.\nHe said the project demonstrates and supports an opportunity in the 24-Hour Economy, aligns with industrialisation, and shows the world that Ghana is very much open for business.\nThe project implementing partners include the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank, Enclave Power Company, John Murphy Construction (JMC), China International Water and Electric Corp (CIWE) and SgurrEnergy.",

        "content": "President John Dramani Mahama has commended The Church of Pentecost for assisting the Ghana Prisons Service with three modern facilities at Ejura, Nsawam, and Damongo.\nThe President was speaking when he commissioned a 300-capacity correctional centre built by the Church at Damango, the Savana regional capital, on Wednesday.\nHe said the event marks not only the opening of a correctional facility, but also the unveiling of a very powerful symbol of hope, redemption, and partnership for national renewal.\n“This project demonstrates what can be achieved when the state, the Church, and the community come together in service to humanity.”\nPresident Mahama added, “It affirms a timeless truth that nation building is not the sole responsibility of government, but a collective moral endeavour of all who believe in the inherent dignity and potential of every human being”.\nHe reiterated the government’s decision to expand the Ghana Prisons Service’s contribution to national development by providing logistics to undertake large-scale farming, poultry, and vegetable production as part of a wider prison reform programme.\nThis, he said, will not only increase food production but generate income to sustain the Service and equip inmates with practical skills for life after their incarceration.\n“The Ghana Prisons Service will actively contribute to the 24-hour economy by running prison industries around the clock. This will include manufacturing, sewing school uniforms, producing furniture, agro-processing, and other goods, both for government use and for the open market,” he added.\nThe President announced an increase in the daily feeding allowance for inmates.\n“We’ve increased the daily feeding rate for inmates from GHS 1.80 to GHS 5.00. This will provide better nutrition for those incarcerated. This is not charity, it is justice. It reflects our belief that dignity should never be dependent on one’s circumstances.”\nPresident Mahama also announced that he would provide the Damongo Camp Prisons with a 66-seater bus to facilitate staff movement.\n“On behalf of the Government and People of Ghana, I wish to express our deep gratitude to Apostle Eric Nyamekye, the Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, the leadership and members of the Church of Pentecost, for your faith in humanity, your partnership with the state, your belief in Mandela’s dictum, that ‘society’s greatness is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.”\nThe Chairman of The Church of Pentecost, Apostle Dr Eric Nyamekye, said their primary objective is to raise disciples of Christ, who would impact their world with righteousness. He added that the Church regards the prison camps as a ‘Kingdom Project’, designed not only to save souls but also to foster the transformation of society.",

        "content": "President John Dramani Mahama has assured that the Big Push project, aimed at transforming Ghana’s economy through extensive road and infrastructure development, is rooted in fairness and equity to ensure both the northern and southern regions of Ghana develop together.\nThe President, speaking at a groundbreaking ceremony for the reconstruction of the Wenchi-Sawla-Wa highway, said the first set of roads selected are the most important at risk across all regions, and the immediate objective is to connect regional and district capitals and other key corridors.\n“We are here to cut sod to cover three regions, Bono East, Savannah, and Upper West regions. Today’s sod cutting marks the commencement of reconstruction for the road from Wenchi to Wa. It will be a new road, very well constructed as an international route to the landlocked countries in Burkina Faso and Mali,” the President said.\nThis sod cutting, he added, “also marks the beginning of a rehabilitation of the Fufolsu – Sawla Road, which was funded under my past administration with a loan from the African Development Bank.”\nThe President explained, “The Wenchi-Wa Road is not an ordinary route. It is part of what we call the National Route N12, and it extends from Wenchi in the Bono region, passes through Bamboi, through Bandan Nkwanta and Tinga, to Sawla, to Tuna and eventually to Wa in the Upper West Region.”\nThis, he said, will open a new corridor of progress to reconnect regions, markets, and families, renewing the promise of inclusive development and affirming that every part of Ghana deserves modern infrastructure, dignity, and opportunity.\nThe project covers 195 kilometres and is divided into seven lots to facilitate concurrent execution for completion within two years.\n“We expect compliance with the highest technical standards, environmental protection and transparent oversight by the Ghana Highway Authority and the Ministry of Roads and Highways”, he cautioned.\nIt is estimated that between 2,000 and 2,500 vehicles pass through the Wenchi-Sawla-Wa corridor, now under construction, carrying nearly 4,000 tons of grain, yams, cashews, and livestock from the middle belts to the north.\n“This road handles a significant volume of Ghana’s agri-freight traffic”, – the President emphasised, explaining that it remains a vital support to the country’s grain and livestock economy, connecting rich farmlands of the Bono East Region to the Sahel trade routes via Hamile on Ghana’s Northern border.\n“The whole of Ghana is going to be a construction site for the next two years, accept the inconvenience”, the President added.\nThe Minister for Roads and Highways, Kwame Governs Agbodza, assured contractors that, under the Big Push Agenda, there would be no delay in payments for work done.\nBolewura Sarfo Kutuge Feso I used the occasion to praise the President’s steadfast dedication to national infrastructure development.",

A key focus of the talks was Ghana’s request for French assistance in combating piracy in its territorial waters. President Mahama sought support to protect Ghana’s maritime integrity from increasing piratical threats in the Gulf of Guinea.\nThe two leaders also discussed a French concessionary loan for Ghana’s health sector that is awaiting parliamentary approval. President Mahama asked his French counterpart to use his influence with the International Monetary Fund to secure Ghana’s access to the facility from the French Development Bank, noting Ghana’s improved debt-to-GDP ratio.\nPresident Mahama, in his capacity as the African Union (AU) Champion of African Financial Institutions, advocated for collaboration to renegotiate loan agreements with lower interest rates for infrastructure projects.\nHe emphasised Ghana’s role as home to the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) secretariat and the need for enhanced road infrastructure to facilitate intra-African trade.\nThe Mahama highlighted Ghana’s ambitious one-million-coders programme, which has already registered 200,000 students. He requested French support to train additional French language teachers to improve language education in Ghanaian schools.\nPresident Macron noted several upcoming opportunities for collaboration, including the VivaTech Summit in Nairobi in May 2026, where Ghana could showcase its digital innovation capabilities, the African Union-European Union summit in Angola, and the June 2026 G7 summit, where France would advocate for increased support for Ghana.\nPresident Mahama raised the subject of reparations for slavery, which Ghana is currently championing. President Macron pledged support for the initiative, noting that France had criminalised slavery, while cautioning that the reparations discussion should acknowledge the involvement of various actors beyond Western powers.\nThe leaders discussed the deteriorating security situation in the Sahel region, particularly terrorist incursions in Mali and other countries of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).\nPresident Macron commended President Mahama’s leadership in the subregion, and Ghana’s economic reforms, pledging continued French support for Ghana’s development agenda.\nEND.",
