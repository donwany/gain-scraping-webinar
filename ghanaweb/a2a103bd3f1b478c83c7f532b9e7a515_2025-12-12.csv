NPP MP prays for 'incurable malaria' for those urging Mahama to seek a third-term,"The Member of Parliament for Suhum, Frank Asiedu Bekoe, has levelled serious accusations against President John Dramani Mahama, alleging attempts to improperly retain power beyond his constitutionally mandated term.
Bekoe further claimed that the ruling party is leveraging its substantial majority in Parliament to intimidate the Minority Caucus, a tactic he insists will not succeed.
He asserted that the actions taken by the Minority Caucus on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, were a direct response to the Majority Caucuss refusal to adhere to due process and parliamentary procedures.
The MP warned that the majority would face continued instability if they persisted in what he termed an abuse of process.
""The minority had no intention to disrupt the proceedings. However, the majority refused to allow the rule to work. If you choose to abuse the law and intimidate your opponents, you will not secure peace.
""If you want to trample on peoples rights, then you will not secure peace. I want to emphasise with the greatest of clarity that if you wish to trample on the rights of others, you will not find peace.
Bekoe characterised the President as a greedy man aspiring to become a life president of Ghana, disregarding the potential existential threats such an ambition poses to the nation.
 President John Dramani Mahama has been consumed by greed and thus seeks to be elected president for life.
""We recently received information that he has created a government platform that includes civil society organisations, Supreme Court judges, journalists, and other officials. This fundamentally undermines the stability of Ghanas laws.
He then made a controversial statement, invoking a divine prayer against those he claimed are hell-bent on staying in power even after his term is over, I pray and ask God to strike any individual or individuals who seek to undermine our laws to create tension and threaten our peace and stability with malaria that is extremely difficult to cure.
The Suhum MP, affectionately known as Protozoa, also condemned the Tamale High Courts decision to order a rerun of the Kpandai constituency election, labelling it as unconstitutional, disastrous, and manipulative.
He argued that the election of Matthew Nyindam as the MP was lawful and reflected the legitimate will of the people, asserting that the National Democratic Congress (NDC) is attempting to illegitimately snatch the seat through an abuse of power, which they are prepared to resist.
The MP criticised the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, for confirming that he instructed the Clerk to notify the Electoral Commission about the vacancy of the Kpandai seat.
Bekoe added that the chaotic actions by the minority were intended to forcefully convey their demand that they are not prepared to cooperate with any business in the House until their concerns are addressed.",,Politics, 12 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/I-pray-that-God-afflicts-those-encouraging-Mahama-to-seek-a-third-term-with-incurable-malaria-NPP-MP-2013367

Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah doubts OSP repeal has no presidential support,"Member of Parliament for Manhyia South, Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah (Esq), expressed his concerns over the recent push to scrap the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP).
His remarks come in the wake of a controversial Private Members Bill introduced by Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga and Majority Chief Whip Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor, seeking the complete repeal of the OSP Act of 2017.
I doubt this move to scrap the OSP is without the support of the President [Mahama] and the Attorney General, Awuah said during the interview on Good Morning Ghana on Metro TV. His statement adds fuel to the growing controversy surrounding the proposed repeal.
According to the MP, the decisions made by Mahama Ayariga and Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor were driven by personal, parochial considerations.
The bill, titled the Office of the Special Prosecutor (Repeal) Bill, 2025, was submitted on December 8, 2025 and proposes to return full prosecutorial authority over corruption cases to the Attorney-Generals office.
The bills sponsors argue that the OSP has faced numerous challenges during its eight years of operation, citing structural and constitutional deficiencies that have hindered its effectiveness.
One of the primary arguments for the repeal is the claim that the OSPs role overlaps with that of the Attorney General, leading to friction, duplication of efforts, and delays in prosecuting criminal cases.
The sponsors believe that the OSPs existence has led to unnecessary confusion in the judicial process and that consolidating prosecutorial power in the hands of the Attorney-General will streamline the handling of corruption cases.
However, the proposed move has raised alarms among some lawmakers and anti-corruption advocates, who argue that abolishing the OSP could diminish the independence and focus required for effective anti-corruption work.
Nana Agyei Baffour Awuahs comments echo these concerns, with the MP questioning whether the President and the Attorney-General are behind the push to weaken the OSPs mandate.
The OSP was established under the administration of former President Akufo-Addo with the aim of strengthening the countrys fight against corruption, a move that was widely supported by anti-corruption campaigners.
Meanwhile, President John Dramani Mahama has directed the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, to withdraw the Private Members Bill seeking to repeal the OSP Act.
The announcement was made in a statement issued by the Minister of State in charge of Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, on December 11, 2025.
President John Dramani Mahama has requested the Majority Leader and Majority Chief Whip in Parliament to withdraw the Private Member's Bill tabled for the repeal of the Act establishing The Office of Special Prosecutor, it noted.
According to the statement, President Mahama made the request following his public endorsement of the OSP as a vital cog in the fight against corruption during a meeting with the Peace Council on Wednesday, December 10, 2025.

Frequent election reruns undermining confidence - Election Watch Ghana,"Election Watch Ghana has raised alarm over the increasing number of election reruns in constituencies such as Kpandai, warning that the trend is draining public funds and eroding trust in the electoral process.
In a statement released on Thursday, December 11, 2025, the watchdog organisation said the frequency of repeat polls points to shortcomings within Ghanas election administration system. It stressed that the neutrality and professionalism of election officials are fundamental to delivering credible outcomes.
The group noted that the recurring disputes and subsequent reruns reflect deeper operational and managerial weaknesses within the Electoral Commission, and urged urgent structural improvements.
Election Watch Ghana also appealed to political parties, particularly the NPP and NDC, to fully engage in the upcoming Kpandai by-election, saying broad participation enhances democratic legitimacy.
It further called on the Electoral Commission to strengthen its procedures, strictly comply with electoral laws, and improve transparency throughout the electoral cycle. The organisation said fixing administrative lapses is essential to preventing avoidable repeat elections.
The statement ended by urging citizens, civil society organisations, and all political stakeholders to support reforms that fortify Ghanas electoral system and rebuild public confidence in democratic institutions.",,Politics, 11 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Frequent-election-reruns-undermining-confidence-Election-Watch-Ghana-2013293
Kpandai Rerun: 'We will win that seat'  Mustapha Gbande declares,"The Deputy General Secretary of the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC), Mustapha Gbande, has expressed strong confidence that the party will win the pending Kpandai parliamentary election rerun.
Speaking on Adom FMs Dwaso Nsem on Thursday, December 11, 2025, Gbande said the party is already intensifying its efforts on the ground.
We are already on our way. We are doing preparations and campaigning hard, and we will win that seat, he stated.
EC sets December 30 for Kpandai parliamentary election rerun
He criticised the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) and incumbent MP Matthew Nyindam, accusing him of neglecting parliamentary duties during crucial moments.
Nyindam was in Kpandai doing campaign when the Minority was disrupting Parliament and needed numbers just to make noise. Of what use will it be to keep Nyindam in Parliament when their numbers will only be used for noise, he claimed.
Gbande also accused the NPP of attempting to rig the earlier election, saying residents of Kpandai deserve better.
The people of Kpandai deserve a very peaceful constituency, but the NPP tried to manipulate that election. They did nothing for the constituency when they were in power for eight years, so it is best that the NDC wins, he stated.
He dismissed suggestions that the NPP could secure a sympathy vote in the rerun.
The NPP just wants a sympathy vote, but Ghanaians wont give them that, he indicated.
However, NPP General Secretary Justin Frimpong Kodua challenged the allegations, questioning whether the developments recorded in Kpandai during the 2024 polls reflected positively on the NDC.
Tamale High Court sets December 18 for ruling on Kpandai MP's stay of execution
Was what happened in Kpandai a good thing? he asked, blaming the NDC for the disturbances that marred the elections and criticising the governments economic management.
The rerun follows a ruling by the Tamale High Court that nullified the 2024 parliamentary results.
While the NDC has welcomed the decision, the NPP has rejected it, arguing that only the affected polling stations, not the entire constituency, should have been subject to a rerun.

What Dr Opoku Prempeh said about ethnic groups in Ghana,"Former Member of
Parliament
for Manhyia South, Dr Matthew Opoku-Prempeh, widely known as NAPO has stressed the importance of understanding Ghana's ethnic diversity particularly in discussions about political leadership.
In an  Adom TV interview on December 11, 2025, he stated that there is no major ethnic group in the country.

There is no majority ethnic group, take it from me, every ethnic group is a minority on its own in the context of Ghana, there is no majority group, there is no tribe that is 50 percent of the population. We have the Bonos the Adansis, the Fantes and so on"", he stated.
The running mate of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) in the 2024 general elections, also touched on ethnic diversity in Northern Ghana and the need for the public to understand their distinct identities.
He urged Ghanaians to refrain from addressing the tribes as one entity.

"Suame MP reacts to Kpandai rerun, dismisses claims his seat is at risk","The Member of Parliament for the Suame Constituency, John Darko, has responded to news of the Kpandai parliamentary seat being declared for a rerun.
According to him, shortly after the announcement, a friend who is a member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) caucus jokingly told him that Suame would be the next seat the NDC would capture.
Darko said he found the comment amusing, insisting that his seat remains one of the safest in the country.
He remarked that even if the president, his vice president and the Speaker of Parliament were to contest the Suame seat against him, he would still defeat them convincingly.
One of my friends told me they were coming for my seat, and I said they can bring the president, the vice president, and even the Speaker to Suame to challenge me; I will beat all of them, John Darko boasted.
Darko made these comments in an interview with a JoyNews reporter, which was later shared on X on Wednesday, December 10, 2025.
His bold declaration has sparked reactions on social media.
Some users mocked the political dynamics of the constituency, with a few suggesting that even an animal presented under the New Patriotic Party (NPP) would still win the Suame seat.

Gbande labels Afenyo-Markin 'subcontractor' over Torkornoo row,"The NDC Deputy General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Mustapha Gbande, has accused Minority Leader
Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin
of having a vested proprietary interest in the Judiciary, describing him as a subcontractor whose companies were doing business at the Judiciary.
According to a myjoyonline.com report on December 11, 2025, Gbande alleged that the Effutu MP personally damaged the image of former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo and exposed her to public distrust.
Gbande was quoted to have said that Afenyo-Markin, helped in politicising her. The individuals who are bystanders, when they look at the issues, what they see is politicisation and who caused it? It was Afenyo-Markin.
ECOWAS court dismisses Torkornoo's application for interim measures
The report added that Gbande stated that Afenyo-Markins companies were reportedly conducting business with the judiciary as subcontractors.
Gbande, who is also a Deputy Director of Operations at the Presidency, dismissed claims that the NDC had orchestrated any campaign against the former Chief Justice.
Instead, he said the crisis was deepened by Afenyo-Markins own interventions.
Gbande cited past concerns he raised about Justice Torkornoos appointment, noting that committees had flagged issues before her confirmation.
He contrasted her tenure with that of former Chief Justice Sophia Akuffo, whom he said managed the office with integrity and without public suspicion.
Pressed on for evidence of the Effutu MPs alleged business dealings, Gbande maintained that Afenyo-Markin had never denied the claims, reinforcing his description of him as a subcontractor allegedly profiting from the Judiciary.
He added that his criticisms were principle-driven rather than partisan, insisting he would speak against any public official, including President
John Dramani Mahama
, if he perceived wrongdoing.

"Kpandai Dispute: Bawumia slams Parliament for undermining precedents, democratic tenets","Former Vice President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
has expressed disappointment in the apparent undermining of democratic institutions in the country in the Kpandai parliamentary issue.
Despite an appeal process filed by the Member of
Parliament
for Kpandai Martin Nyindam, challenging a high court order for the 2024 parliamentary election to be rerun,
Parliament
wrote the
Electoral Commission
declaring the seat vacant and the EC has subsequently announced a date for the election to be re-run.
Both parliament and the EC have come under criticism for ignoring the appeal process, and the former Vice President has also taken a dim view of the raw deal being handed to the MP, which he said, goes against democratic principles and precedent.
Grand welcome for Bawumia in Wa as he begins tour of the North
""To say the least I'm very disappointed with what is going on in our country. It looks like our institutions of democracy, and our tenets of democracy are being undermined,"" Dr Bawumia said in an interview.
""The issue of Kpandai with Mathew Nyindam is not a new issue in our democratic politics. We have had issues with Dan Abodakpi, issues with Takyi Quaison in Assin. Basically you've had the House allow the legal processes to take place and be exhausted before state institutions are subpleaded into acting into ways that undermine democracy.""
Dr Bawumia, who expressed surprise at the ""indecent haste"" with which the MP is being denied a fair court process, slammed
Parliament
and called for all involved to respect the democratic institutions and tenets of the country.
""Martin Nyindam should be given his day in court. He has filed appeal processes at the high Court. He has filed for a judicial review at the Supreme Court and none of those cases has been adjudicated so why the rush? Why the indecent haste?""
""I think that he is being railroaded, I think that this undermines our institutions of democracy, and I think that we should take a halt to these processes and allow him to have his day in court as others have done in the past.""
Why Dr Bawumia continues to receive strong backing from NPP MPs
""The House has never really rushed in this way when it came to the other cases. What is the difference with the case of Martin Nyindam?""
""It should not be the case. We should uphold the tenets of democracy. Democracy is something precious that we've all had and we have all subscribed to.""
Dr Bawumia further warned against using political power to ""break down"" the pillars of democracy, saying its consequences are severe for the country.
""When you start undermining its  (democracy) pillars, you break it down and the consequences for the nation are very severe. Simply because you have power, you shouldn't feel that you can run roughshod over your opponents and the principles of democracy.""

"When lawmakers break the law, punches take over  4 times Parliament descended into chaos","Ghanas
Parliament
is expected to be a chamber of law, order and democratic maturity. But over the past five years, the House has repeatedly made headlines for all the wrong reasons, from shoving matches to midnight brawls.
Here are four major moments when lawmakers abandoned procedure and chaos took over.
January 7, 2021  Chaos during election of Speaker
The 8th
Parliament
began on a turbulent note when the election of the Speaker turned into chaos.
Tempers flared, ballot papers were snatched, and members nearly came to blows.
The MPs-elect at thew time on the eve of the event were captured arguing over who sits on the majority or minority side of the House.
It generated into pushing and shoving, calling each other names, kicking of a ballot box, snatching of ballot papers, among others, causing chaos in the chamber at the watch of the world.
At some point, military and police barged into the Chamber to maintain peace and order. This has incurred the displeasure of most Ghanaians who are calling on the Speaker to start an investigation into what happened.
However, despite the widespread public condemnation and regular calls for investigations into the incident no formal investigative committee was ever established.
December 20, 2021  Midnight brawl over E-Levy approval
A brawl broken out in Ghana's parliament during a late-night session over a contentious government-proposed levy on electronic transactions.
MPs shoved, pushed and threw punches at each other, while others tried to stop the fighting.
The chaos started after opposition MPs rushed forward to prevent the then Deputy Speaker Joseph Osei Owusu from leaving his seat to vote.
He was chairing the session, which was then adjourned because of the disorder.
The then opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) rejected the proposed levy of 1.75% on electronic transactions, which includes mobile-money payments.
The NDC at the time said it will hit low-income people and those outside the formal banking sector.
But former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta stated that it was necessary to widen the tax net, arguing that it could raise an extra 6.9bn Ghanaian cedi ($1.15bn; 870m) next year.
February 1, 2025  Physical altercation during ministerial vetting
There was chaos in the
Parliament
of Ghana over the vetting of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa.
The Appointments Committee had agreed on vetting four nominees on January 30, 2025.
However, five were vetted and two more were being added, including the then minister-designate of Foreign Affairs, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and the minister-designate of Health, Kwabena Mintah Akandoh, which generated the chaos.
As a result of the chaos between the Majority and Minority, microphones and tables were destroyed.
The Minority side were seen overturning the vetting table.
We agreed on four; we have done five. Kofi Adams was not part of the process, but we have done it. It will not happen, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, the Member of
Parliament
for Nsawam Adoagyire, who doubles as Minority Chief Whip, said in an interview at the time.
Four MPs were suspended and a committee was set up to investigate but its findings were never made public.
December 9, 2025  Chaos over declaration of Kpandai seat vacant
Chaos erupted in Ghanas
Parliament
during proceedings on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, after members of the Minority Caucus abandoned their seats and massed at the centre of the chamber.
The disturbance flared during heated exchanges over the declaration of the Kpandai parliamentary seat as vacant, a decision the Minority maintains is unlawful and procedurally flawed.
Before the confrontation, Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga had dismissed what he described as the Minoritys continuous and orchestrated protest, insisting he was not surprised by their attempts to obstruct parliamentary business.
The Bawku Central MP accused the Minority of deliberately derailing parliamentary work over the contested Kpandai seat, arguing that the caucus had resorted to noise-making and unruly behaviour to prevent the Speaker from delivering rulings.
However, Minority Chief Whip Frank Annoh-Dompreh countered sharply, warning that government business would continue to suffer until the Kpandai matter is resolved.
Moments after his remarks, tensions escalated.
Despite the Speakers attempts to proceed, Minority MPs intensified their protest, rising from their seats, marching into the middle of the chamber and chanting in opposition.
The sudden movement triggered a chaotic confrontation, with MPs from both sides surging toward the centre of the floor.
GhanaWeb cameras captured dramatic scenes inside the chamber as MPs in a heated face-off, papers flying through the air and the Member of
Parliament
for Assin South, John Ntim Fodjour, seen angrily yelling at a colleague.

You're part of the mess so you can't blame Akufo-Addo  Odike descends on Kufuor,"Founder and Leader of the United Progressive Party (UPP), Akwasi Addai Odike, has criticized former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
over his recent comments about the administration of former President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
.
According to Odike, former President Kufuor has no grounds to blame Akufo-Addo because he is also part of the challenges the country is currently facing.
Speaking in an interview on Angel TV on December 9, 2025, Odike stated that Kufuor had the responsibility to question Akufo-Addo on some of his decisions but failed to do so and therefore should not be criticizing him now.
To be honest with you, I have learnt two things from what Kufuor said. The first is that he wants to tell us that the NPP is not an organized party but we know that a political party is a group of people who have come together with one ideology and a common interest.
Also, Kufuor wants us to push the blame onto Akufo-Addo so that Ghanaians will have sympathy for the NPP, that Akufo-Addo is to be blamed and not the party as a whole, he said.
Odike further stated, But Kufuor should know that he is a statesman and he has every right to speak up when things are not going well. Kufuor was silent on so many things. When he saw that the Cathedral was being funded by the state, what did he do about it? When everyone was criticizing him, what did he do?
I didnt expect such words from him because he is part of the NPP and what did he do about Akufo-Addos government?
He added, So, with Akufo-Addos government, Kufuor is part of the mess. He didnt help the country, and that is why we are still here. It is not today that they want to paint the NPP nicely to the public by putting all the blame on Akufo-Addo.
His comments come after Kufuor criticized the Akufo-Addo administration over troubling policy choices which he believes contributed to the New Patriotic Partys defeat in the 2024 general elections.
Speaking on The Delay Show, Kufuor said he never understood the rationale behind key decisions such as the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), the National Cathedral project, and the Power Distribution Services (PDS) deal, adding that he was not consulted on any of them.
He further noted that the NPPs return to power in 2016 was largely driven by the record and achievements of his administration.
Before the 2016 election in which Akufo-Addo was elected, the campaign was built on my achievements. Those achievements played a key role in his victory. The government started on a good note, but things changed after he assumed power, Kufuor said.

'Who are you to warn judges'  Kwesi Pratt slams Afenyo-Markin,"Veteran journalist and Managing Editor of the Insight Newspaper,
Kwesi Pratt Jnr
, has warned Minority Leader in Parliament, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, over recent comments he made about the judiciary.
Speaking during a panel discussion, on metro TV on December 10, 2025, Pratt described the Minority Leaders remarks, accusing judges of acting in the interest of political paymasters ""as dangerously contemptuous and capable of attracting severe legal consequences.
According to Pratt, actions and utterances that in previous decades might have attracted immediate sanctions are now being treated with unusual leniency.
He referenced an ongoing case before the Court of Appeal, expressing astonishment that a lawyer would address a press conference just 24 hours before the court sits, issuing warnings to judges about what decision they should or should not take.
'What kind of kangaroo court is this?'  Minority reacts to Kpandai election rerun
Now, you see, so many things have changed over the years. Some of the things that happened yesterday in the 1960s and 1970s would have resulted in people going to prison today for contempt. There's an application before the Court of Appeal, 24 hours before the court sits.
Somebody who is a lawyer addresses a press conference and is warning the Court of Appeal judges not to take a certain position. That's clear contempt. Clear contempt.
Who are you, before the judges have heard the case to hold a press conference to warn the judges that they must take a particular decision or that you will hold them responsible for the chaos that will happen in the country and that if they take a certain line of action or a certain decision, he said.
Afenyo-Markin launched an attack on the judiciary after the Tamale High Court annulled the 2024 parliamentary election in the Kpandai Constituency.
The Minority Leader described the courts conduct as shameful and accused judges of serving the interests of their political paymasters.

Ntim Fordjour provides blow-by-blow account of recent chaos in Parliament,"Member of Parliament for Assin South, Reverend Ntim Fordjour has provided a first-hand account of the events that led to one of the most chaotic sessions in Parliament on December 9, 2025.
In an interview on Metro TVs Good Evening Ghana show, Ntim Fordjour said the unrest began because the Speaker ruled that the Kpandai seat was vacant, a decision contested by the Minority side of Parliament.
According to him, following the ruling, the Clerk of Parliament sent a formal letter to the Electoral Commission to act on the declaration.
The Minority, however, requested that the Speaker review his decision before further action was taken.
The Speaker indicated that he would give a follow-up ruling the next day which was December 10, 2025, leaving two possibilities: either to confirm the initial ruling or to change it.
'Fight' breaks out in Ghana's parliament
He noted that by the time these discussions were taking place, it was already past 7 p.m. The minority proposed adjourning the House and resuming business the following day after the Speakers review.
He stressed that adjourning was a practical solution, especially since there was no urgent business that could not wait until the next day and the Majority and Speaker declined.
He further noted that despite the Minoritys objections, the Speaker, in consultation with the Majority Leader, insisted that business must continue. This refusal to adjourn disregarded the Minority's expressed sentiment and set the stage for the chaos that followed.
Then the next day, they will come and then undertake the rest of the businesses after the Speaker had indeed declared and rescinded his decision. Then they said no. They insisted that they will carry on business.
""We said, No. Let's just adjourn. And we ran this House, Minority and Majority, on consensus. So, you can't treat the House as though it is a one-party state. The Speaker corroborated with the Majority Leader and insisted that we complete disregard to the presence and sentiment of the minority business must go on, he recounted.
Ntim Fordjour said as the Minority members stood up to assert their position, parliamentary rules regarding order were reportedly ignored. Ntim Fordjour described how the Speaker watched as proceedings deteriorated into disorder.
The situation escalated when the Marshal of Parliament was called in. According to Ntim Fordjour, the Marshal assaulted a female MP standing in the Minoritys group, an act he described as unacceptable.
Speaker sanctioned the Marshal of Parliament to come and then heckle the Minority. In the process, the Marshal assaulted a female Member of Parliament who was standing right in front of me. I got so upset.
""Did they sanction you to come and assault females? I'm a father of girls. I have daughters. And if you have a wife, you have daughters, and you have sisters, you should be so sensitive not to sanction Marshals to go and assault a female, he stated.
He recounted that the Majority continued to push through business, including more than 24 budget estimates, despite the Minoritys protests and attempts to adjourn.
The Member of Parliament for Assin South emphasised that the Minoritys actions were a legitimate stand against the unilateral handling of Parliament, not an attempt to obstruct proceedings.

Stop misleading delegates - Former Ashanti MMDCEs fire back at Naa Torshie,"A group of former Municipal, Metropolitan and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) in the Ashanti Region have launched a blistering attack on former District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF) Administrator, Irene Naa Torshie Addo, accusing her of misleading delegates and attempting to shift blame for the New Patriotic Partys (NPP) 2024 electoral losses.
In a strongly worded statement, the Concerned Former MMDCEs said the former MP for Tema West supervised erratic, inconsistent and meagre disbursement of the Common Fundactions they claim crippled local development, angered communities and significantly affected the partys fortunes in 2024.
She failed at DACF but wants to blame Bawumia former MMDCEs fired.
The group says Naa Torshie has been telling delegates in the Ashanti Region that former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia  then head of the Economic Management Team  failed to stabilize the cedi and refused to intervene for the release of DACF arrears.
But the MMDCEs insist her claims expose a fundamental misunderstanding of Ghanas governance structure.
The Vice President does not supervise the Common Fund. He has no statutory mandate to determine when the Fund is released, the statement stressed.
They argued that as a former Deputy Minority Whip and lawyer, Naa Torshie should know that the Economic Management Team is only advisory and has no operational power over DACF disbursement.
MMDCEs accuse Naa Torshie of hoarding funds, running a procurement shop
The former appointees alleged that the ex-DACF Administrator repeatedly sidestepped her legal obligations under Act 455 by withholding funds and instead turning her office into what they described as a procurement outfit.
They claim her office awarded contracts and purchased cutlasses, boots, desks, streetlights, jerseys and other itemsoften without consulting assemblies, leaving real development needs unattended.
They also accused her of:
Unilaterally allocating funds for fumigation exercises that allegedly never happened
Awarding contracts for toilets, water systems and school infrastructure from Accra
Selectively choosing beneficiary schools
Causing the Assemblies to lose DPAT VI support due to refusal to release counterpart funding
Dont hide behind gender; accountability has nothing to do with being a woman
Responding to reports that Naa Torshie sometimes attributes criticisms to misogyny, the MMDCEs pushed back strongly:
Irregularities and improper conduct have nothing to do with gender. Right is right, wrong is wrong.
They maintain that her administrative style sparked grassroots frustration, widening the disconnect between government and voters ahead of the 2024 elections.
Contracts allegedly linked to her inner circle
The statement also revived long-standing allegations within party circles that nearly 90% of DACF contracts under her watch were awarded to close associatesincluding, they claimed, her husband, who they suggest has ties to the opposition NDC.
No committee blamed Bawumia for 2024 defeat
The group described her attempts to shift blame to Dr Bawumia as politically self-serving.
She should be the last person to point fingers, they asserted, adding that neither internal party committees nor external research bodies ever attributed the election loss to the former Vice President.
The former MMDCEs said they felt compelled to speak the truth to prevent delegates from being misled as key internal elections approach.
We cannot build a stronger party by distorting the past. Let us commit to honesty. Let us safeguard unity. And let no individual mislead delegates for personal ambition.""
The statement was signed by six former Ashanti regional MMDCEs, including Maxwell Ofosu Boakye (Suame), Michael Amoah Awuku (Atwima Nwabiagya South), and  Prince Osei Tutu Karikari Brempong (Atwima Kwanwoma), among others.",,Politics, 11 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Stop-misleading-delegates-Former-Ashanti-MMDCEs-fire-back-at-Naa-Torshie-2013170
Choose Bawumia to lead us back to victory - Dr Prempeh charges NPP executives,"Running mate to Dr Mahamudu Bawumia in the 2024 general elections and former Energy Minister, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has made a compelling and passionate appeal to NPP executives across the country to place Dr Mahamudu Bawumia first and elect him as the partys next flagbearer.
In a powerful message delivered during meetings with regional and constituency executives in the Bono Region, Dr Opoku Prempeh said the future of the New Patriotic Party depends on choosing a leader who is prepared, visionary and capable of restoring the partys strength.
According to him, Dr Bawumia is the only candidate with the experience, discipline and modern leadership mindset needed to reposition the NPP for victory.
He urged executives to reflect deeply on what lies ahead for the party and the country, stressing that the choice they make now will define the NPPs path to recovery after the 2024 electoral loss.
If we truly want to rebuild and return to power, then we must rally behind the leader who has shown unmatched dedication and readiness. That leader is Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, he declared.
Dr Opoku Prempeh emphasised that while internal contestations are normal in democratic politics, the NPP must not allow differences to overshadow the need for unity behind the elephant. He reminded members that the party is strongest when it stands together and weakest when divided.
In a rare moment of candour and humility, Dr Opoku Prempeh acknowledged the shortcomings of the Nana Addoled administration, including decisions that contributed to the partys defeat in the 2024 general elections. He offered an apology on behalf of himself, Dr Bawumia and the former government, describing it as an important step toward rebuilding public trust.
He noted that honest reflection, unity and collective resolve are the only tools that can restore the NPPs credibility and set the stage for a stronger comeback.
Dr Opoku Prempeh therefore called on all executives to conduct their campaigns with civility, respect and discipline, reminding them that once the internal contest ends, every member will be needed to push the party toward victory.
He concluded with a stirring message of hope:
If we stand together and choose the right leader  Dr Mahamudu Bawumiathe NPP will rise again. Our comeback is in our own hands.
The message has energised party faithful and is already resonating across the grassroots as a rallying call for unity, renewal and focused leadership ahead of the upcoming flagbearer election.",,Politics, 11 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Choose-Bawumia-to-lead-us-back-to-victory-Dr-Prempeh-charges-NPP-executives-2013169
Grand  welcome for Bawumia in Wa as he begins tour of the North,"Former Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, was accorded a rapturous reception into Upper West Regional Capital, Wa, earlier today as he began a tour of the Region, and the north.
Party supporters, adorned in the party's blue, red and white colours, rode on motorbikes to welcome the former Vice President from the outskirts of the regional capital, and rode with him to the first destination of his campaign engagement at Wechiaw in the Wa West Constituency.
There, party stalwarts in the region, including former appointees of the erstwhile government, parliamentary candidates as well as a host of grassroot members met him upon his arrival, amidst traditional drums, singing and dancing.
Dr Bawumia then made a grand entry into the hall, where he addressed NPP delegates and supporters.
From there, he continued to Wa Central where he held similar engagements with an enthusiastic crowd, which showed open support for his bid to be retained as the NPP's Flagbearer for the 2028 elections.
Dr Bawumia, who has been engaging delegates and party faithful across the country, is scheduled to also tour the Upper East and the North East Region in the coming days.
He has so far toured the Ahafo, Bono, None East, Western North, Western, Oti, Volta, Central and Eastern Regions respectively, ahead of the NPP's January 31 election to elect a Flagbearer.

Parliament has collapsed; no law is functioning - Michael Okyere Baafi claims,"The Member of Parliament for New Juaben South Constituency in the Eastern Region, Michael Okyere Baafi, has issued a strong criticism of the current state of parliamentary affairs, claiming that Parliament has collapsed and that no law is working in the House now.
Speaking in an interview on Accra 100.5 FMs Ghana Yensom morning show hosted by Chief Jerry Forson, the MP defended the recent confrontational actions of the Minority in Parliament, stating that they feel silenced and powerless under current conditions.
According to Okyere Baafi, the Minority believes they must adopt a more aggressive approach because lawful parliamentary procedures and Standing Orders are no longer being respected.
We have decided to go violent until we are heard, he declared, adding that the mechanisms that previously governed the House are no longer functional.
When the host questioned how Parliaments Standing Orders which formerly ensured order and fairness had become ineffective, Baafi insisted that Ghanas parliamentary democracy had deteriorated.
Parliament has collapsed. There is no law working in Parliament. The democracy of Ghana has really fallen. The laws in Parliament are no longer functioning, he said.
He further alleged that there is an agenda by certain forces within Parliament aimed at sidelining the entire Minority Caucus.
According to him, the plan was to remove Minority MPs and trigger by-elections in their constituencies, a move he believes could shift national political control.
Their aim is for Parliament to take all the Minority MPs out so they can declare by-elections in our constituencies.
Then the NDC can control Ghana.
When there is no Minority, they can do whatever they want, he explained.

Sky Train Case: AG first witness ordered to produce 16 emails,"An Accra High Court presided over Justice Audrey Kokuvie-Tay has ordered the first prosecution witness in the case of the Republic versus Solomon Asamoah and another (Sky Train Case), Yaw Odame-Darkwa, to retrieve and produce some 16 emails he received from the former Chief Executive Officer, CEO of Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund (GIIF), Solomon Asamoah to the Court at its next sitting on Tuesday, 16 December 2025.
The Court made the order after the defence lawyer (lawyer for the 1st accused), Victoria Barth Esq., sought to confirm from the prosecution witness, Odame-Darkwa, if he indeed received those emails that pertained to the Sky Train project from the CEO, Solomon Asamoah, when he served as a member of the board of directors of GIIF.
Victoria Barth requested that the prosecution witness retrieve the emails from his smartphone, which he had brought to court, since the email addresses were Yahoo and Gmail accounts that could easily be accessed on a smartphone or laptop with internet provided by the court.
However, Odame-Darkwa told the Court that in this age of AI, anything is possible, and he preferred to retrieve the emails using his own computer and internet access point rather than any device or network provided by another source.
Witness statement
From paragraphs 10 to 14 of his 16-paragraph witness statement, Yaw Odame-Darkwa stated as follows:
During my tenure, the Board approved funding for several infrastructure projects.
I wish to state that the Sky Train concept was only introduced at one of our Board meetings.
The Board did not receive any substantive proposal on the Sky Train project, and hence we did not deliberate or take any decision on the project.
Additionally, the Investment Committee did not recommend the Sky Project to the Board for approval.
To the best of my knowledge, the Sky Train project has not been tabled for consideration at any Board Meeting.
If the emails that the defence lawyers are seeking to confirm are valid, it will effectively render the evidence of the 1st prosecution witness (Yaw Odame-Darkwa) that he never heard of the Sky Train project until the Auditor Generals report was released, completely inconsistent with the truth.
Cross-examination
During the continuation, Yaw Odame-Darkwas cross-examination in Court on Wednesday, 10 December 2025, Victoria Barth first asked;
Question: Before board meetings were held to discuss new projects or existing projects, there would usually be a preceding meeting of the investment committee (IC) of the board of GIIF. Is that not so?
Answer: Because you used usually, the answer is yes.
Question: The investment committee of which you were a member would usually receive an e-mail notice from either the acting secretary, Kofi Boakye, the CEO (A1), or Harriet Aban, the substantive company secretary. Is that correct?
Answer: Yes
Question: These e-mail notices would usually include the agenda and documents or board pacts for the upcoming meeting of the investment committee. Is that not so?
Answer: Yes
Question: During your tenure on the board of GIIF, some of the projects that the IC considered at its meetings included the Safari Hotel project, Maha Hotel Resort, Woodfields (Fidelity) Tank Farm, and Emirates Capital. Is that correct?
Answer: Yes
Question: I am going to show you some e-mail correspondence on the meeting of the IC on 31/7/18 and 28/718, which dealt with some of the projects I have just mentioned to you.
First, Im showing you an email from Saturday, July 28, 2018, sent at 6:48 pm on the subject Investment Committee 31 July 2 pm from Solomon Asamoah to you and other board members.
There are other emails following up on Monday 30 July at 10:27 am with an attached portfolio update report. These are emails that you received, is that not so?
Answer: That is what it looks like. I would need time to look at it and confirm.
Question: Have you deleted the e-sims that you received while you were at the GIIF board from your e-mail account?
Answer: No.
Question: So, if this court provides a computer with internet access, you would be able to retrieve these emails from your inbox even now, is that not so?
Answer: Not now
Question: If the first accused is called upon to go into his e-mail account on a device provided by the court with internet access right now and the emails are retrieved, would that help you confirm that you received these emails?
Answer:
In this era of AI, anything can be done. So, Ill trust what I would retrieve from my own mail. That is, Im asking the court to give me time to go through my personal e-mail.
Question: Yaw Odame-Darkwa, time is of the essence, and there are many emails to be shown to you. So, it should be possible for you right here and right now to go into that smartphone of yours and retrieve the emails in question. Is it not possible?
Answer: My Lady, it is not possible because Im not using that e-mail right now, and I cannot access it now.
Question: You have internet access on your phone, dont you?
Answer: Yes
Question: Your e-mail addresses are a Yahoo e-mail address and a Gmail address, is that not so?
Answer: Yes
Question: You are aware that you can access your e-mail address by going online to sign in to Yahoo, are you not?
Answer: Yes, Im aware.
Question:  Then, for the sincerity of that e-mail in your account to be preserved, I am suggesting that it must be retrieved right now from your phone. Im suggesting to you that it is possible to retrieve it from your phone right now.
Answer: My Lady, it is not possible.
Request for court order
To this end, Victoria Barth prayed the court to order the witness to access those emails with internet support that would be provided to him.
However, principal state attorney Sefakor Batse urged the court to allow the witness to independently retrieve the emails and supply the same to the court at the next adjourned date.

Victoria Barth further indicated in court that to enable the witness to do a comprehensive verification, she provided specific details of the 16 emails the defence is seeking to retrieve from the e-mail of the witness.
By Court
Flowing from the cross-examination and submission of learned counsels, it is my considered view that the witness should be given time to verify and confirm, and if possible, also produce that which requires an evaluation.
In the circumstances, the witness would be ordered to provide them on the next date, which is 15 December 2025, Justice Audrey Kokuvie-Tays court ruled.
Background
In 2019, the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund (GIIF) invested US$2 million for a 10% stake in Africa Investor Skytrain Consortium Holdings (Ai Skytrain), the company developing Accras Skytrain light railway project.
The Africa Investor Group (the Sponsors) was selected and granted the rights to develop the project by the Government of Ghana (GoG) through the Ministry of Railways Development (MORD).
At the time, the Chairman of GIIF was Professor Christopher Ameyaw-Akumfi, and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was Solomon Asamoah.  T
he Chairman had previously been a member of the GoG.  Asamoah was an international development banker who had been head-hunted into the position from a UK recruitment agency.
a href=""https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Accra-Sky-Train-Project-GIIF-CEO-Asamoah-granted-GH-15m-bail-Ameyaw-Ekumfi-absent-1983887"" target=""_blank"">Accra Sky Train Project: GIIF CEO Asamoah granted GH15m bail, Ameyaw-Ekumfi absent
Following a change of government in Ghana in December 2024, the GoG, through the office of the Attorney General of Ghana, now alleges that this action was taken without Board approval, resulting in a willful financial loss to the state, as there is as yet no railway built.
It should be noted that there are no allegations of personal gain or diversion of funds in the charges, and the state has not charged anyone from MORD or the GoG-selected sponsors; only the GIIF Chairman and CEO have been charged.
The state witnesses who initially faced charges of causing financial loss to the state themselves dropped these charges after stating they did not approve the project, casting significant doubt on the reliability of their statements.
The prosecutions case is built almost entirely on these statements to show that a legitimate transaction was unauthorised, without which there would be no case to answer.
The prosecutions case appears to be politically motivated, intended to fulfil a campaign promise to prosecute members of the previous government. It is unsupported by the facts, relying on demonstrably false witness statements, a lawyer familiar with the case stated on condition of anonymity.

"Ofori-Atta did well in the first term, but we did not want him again - Effia MP","The Effia Member of Parliament, Isaac Boamah-Nyarko, has shared that former Mi ister of Finance
Ken Ofori-Atta
was not the preferred choice of many within the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) government for the second term of the former Akufo-Addo administration.
Speaking candidly on JoyPrime on Wednesday, December 10, 2025, Boamah-Nyarko said that while Ofori-Atta played a crucial role in the early years of the government, by the time the 2020 Election were over, internal confidence in his leadership at the finance ministry had waned significantly.
Four high-profile corruption cases
Ken Ofori-Atta
is wanted for
Boamah Nyarko noted that Ofori-Atta brought energy and momentum during the NPPs first term, driving several key reforms and contributing to the administrations early successes.
From the beginning of government in 2017, when we came to power, everybody could see the energy, the strength, the transformation that his first two, three years commanded, he stated.
However, he explained that by the end of the first term, persistent public concerns and internal dissatisfaction over his management style suggested that a change would have been more appropriate heading into the second term.
I believe that the second half of the year, a lot of the challenges that were coming up, where people's complaints centered around the way and manner he was running the ministry, that was where we needed a change, he shared.
Boamah-Nyarko acknowledged Ofori-Attas competence but stressed that staying on as finance minister in former President Akufo-Addos second term was not the expectation or desire of many within the government.
He can be, and is, a fine finance minister, but he got a lot of other things wrong... He [Ofori-Atta] wasn't the one we wanted, he stated.
Ken Ofori-Atta
declared wanted on INTERPOL's Red Notice list
He described it as a normal part of governance for leaders to lose momentum over time, saying that after years of intense pressure, it was natural for the minister to be allowed to step aside.
As a government, you can't be best all the time... after a while, youd have gotten exhausted with ideas and you move on to another challenge, he noted.

'Parliament on the verge of committing constitutional travesty' - Minority on Kpandai seat,"The Minority Caucus in
Parliament
has criticised ongoing moves to declare the Kpandai parliamentary seat vacant, describing the development as a direct assault on constitutional governance and a dangerous precedent for Ghanas democracy.
Addressing the press on Wednesday, December 10, 2025, the Deputy Minority Leader
Patricia Appiagyei
delivered a strongly worded statement condemning actions taken by parliamentary leadership and the Clerk of
Parliament
following a contested High Court ruling on the Kpandai seat.
'Fight' breaks out in Ghana's parliament
According to Appiagyei,
Parliament
risks a constitutional travesty and a historical self-betrayal if it proceeds on the basis of the Clerks notification to the Electoral Commission (EC), which signals that the Kpandai seat has become vacant.
... A direct assault on the constitutional rights of the people of Kpandai, a dangerous breach of the separation of powers in the redress, and a reckless disregard for both our judicial process and our own parliamentary history. This House is on the verge of committing a constitutional travesty and a historical self-betrayal, she said.
She argued that the Clerks letter, issued in response to a High Court order currently under challenge, cannot form the basis for declaring the seat vacant, especially when the New Patriotic Partys (NPP)
Matthew Nyindam
, who won the seat by 3,734 votes, has already triggered legal processes to halt the judgment.
We have taken note of a formal communication from the Clerk of
Parliament
, issued pursuant to the contested High Court order notifying the Electoral Commission of a vacancy in this Honorable House.  On the strength of that notification alone, the Electoral Commission is expected to regard the Kpandai
Parliament
ary Seat as vacant though it is a seat that was decisively won by the New Patriotic Party with a clear and commanding mandate of a difference of 3,734 votes, the Minority argued.
Appiagyei stressed that the courts decision is not final, citing the MPs filing of a stay of execution, a legal step that seeks to suspend the enforcement of the ruling until further judicial review is complete.
As I stand before you, the honorable member for Kpandai,
Matthew Nyindam
has duly exercised his constitutional rights. He has filed a stay of execution halting by the oppression of law, the effect of that very judgment, they submitted.

The Minority contends that proceeding with the declaration despite the pending stay application undermines the separation of powers, interferes with judicial processes, and disenfranchises the people of Kpandai.

Ayariga lists NPP MPs who backed request for Speaker's clarification in Kpandai case,"The Majority Leader in Parliament,
Mahama Ayariga
, has shared a list of names from the Minority Caucus in Parliament who had agreed with him in conclave on the need to seek the Speaker's clarification on whether the Clerk of Parliament's actions were in line with procedures or not.
Speaking on Joy FM on Wednesday, December 10, 2025, the leader mentioned the names of former Minister of Defence Dominic Nitiwul, Deputy Minority Leader
Patricia Appiagyei
, MP for Weija-Gbawe Jerry Ahmed, and MP for Tolon Habib Iddrisu.
3 times Parliament has declared seats vacant in 2025
According to him, the confusion stemmed from the Speakers statement on a parliamentary process, which he said was open to interpretation.
As for what the Speaker said, it is open to different interpretation. Speaker said that if he filed processes, it may, he didn't say that it will, so we're asking Speaker to come and explain what it may means, Ayariga said.
He added that he had convened a meeting with Minority members to ensure transparency and avoid misunderstandings.
When I met with them, I said I think that perhaps you have a genuine misunderstanding of it, and so because your misunderstanding may be genuine, let's all be transparent about it. Let's get back into the chamber, restate your case, emphasise the fact that you acted based on Speaker's statement that a process filed by you may [be valid], and then I will also repeat what I think the clerk acted on, and all of us will agree that there's a genuine misunderstanding, it's not your fault.
... Let's call Speaker to come and clarify. I was being very sincere and they agreed with me in conclave. They said they wanted to go and talk to their backbenchers and see if they will allow them to come and make a statement. I said, your backbenchers are the ones to allow me to come and make a statement in the house? Can you imagine that? Nitiwul was in the meeting, Honorable Habib, the deputy Minority Leader [Patricia Apiagyei] was in the meeting, Honorable Jerry was in the meeting and I was in the meeting, he stated.
He said the Minority members initially agreed to consult their backbenchers before returning to the chamber to allow him to make a statement and invite the Speaker to clarify.
When I explained to them, they said, okay, we'll go and talk to our backbenchers to see whether we can all come back into the chamber, so that as a leader, you can state this clearly. If you state this clearly, then we can now invite Speaker to come and give a ruling. They went and then we sat in the Speaker's waiting room for about 10 minutes and they came back and said, our backbenchers have refused. I said, who are your backbenchers to say they have refused? Who are they? Who are your backbenchers to say that I, as a leader cannot come into the chamber and then try to resolve an issue? he continued.
The Bawku Central MP insisted that the chaotic scenes that ensued in Parliament and the actions of the Minority was not about the declaration of the Kpandai seat as vacant.
'Fight' breaks out in Ghana's parliament
It's not about Kpandai. Even if you have issues with Kpandai and you are a law-abiding group of political actors, you know the law and the process, but to try to hijack the democracy and start threatening instability and the democracy, then who are you? he concluded.

Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu casts doubt on Bagbin's handling of Kpandai vacancy seat case,"Former Majority Leader
Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu
has raised concerns over
Parliament
s handling of the Kpandai vacant seat, noting that it is a sharp departure from precedence.
He argued that the Speaker,
Alban Bagbin
, has taken a completely different position as compared to how he handled the case involving the Assin North seat in 2023, when James Gyakye Quaysons position was declared vacant.

Parliament
Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu
explained that in that instance, the Speaker insisted that any communication from the courts relating to a sitting MP must be directed at the Speaker, not the Clerk of
Parliament
.
In the Gyakye Quayson case, when communication from the court came through the Clerk, the Speaker indicated that because the matter related to a Member of
Parliament
, it was not within the Clerks jurisdiction. The Speaker was responsible, he explained.
'Fight' breaks out in Ghana's parliament
He questioned why, under the same Speaker, the clerk is now the one receiving and acting on such communication.
So, what has changed that today service is directed at the Clerk of
Parliament
? he asked.
He added that in the earlier case, the Speaker of
Parliament
had insisted
Parliament
could not rush to notify the Electoral Commission so long as an appeal had been filed.
According to him, the Speaker cautioned that an irreparable damage will be done if
Parliament
rushed to communicate the decision of the court to the Electoral Commission for them to hold a by-election.
Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu also stated that his earlier position was clear, hence
Parliament
must wait until all legal processes are exhausted before writing to the EC.
We should wait until the processes have been exhausted... then
Parliament
will communicate the vacancy, he recalled.
The former Majority Leader also rejected suggestions that the clerk may have acted independently.
Lets be honest with ourselves. No clerk ever acts on his own in any such case, a decision is taken... the clerk is then instructed by the Speaker to write. No clerk acts on his own. There shouldnt be any pretensions about this.
He recalled that in the earlier matter, the Speaker himself barred the clerk from receiving court documents.
The Speaker said... this matter relates to the Member of
Parliament
who does not come under your supervision. It is I, the Speaker. So, they should go back. What has changed? he asied.
Parliament
has formally notified the Electoral Commission (EC) of a vacancy in the membership of the House for the Kpandai Constituency, following a court order mandating a re-run of the 2024
Parliament
ary Elections in that area.
The letter, addressed to the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission, Jean Mensa, was issued and signed by Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror, the Clerk to

'I hold Kufuor in high esteem'  Ama Daaku refutes claims of attacking statesman,"Ellen Ama Daaku, an aide to former Vice President
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, has dismissed suggestions that she disrespected former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
in a video that recently surfaced online.
Addressing the contents of the video via a statement on December 9, 2025, Ama Daaku stressed that she holds the former president in high regard and would never deliberately attack him.
I hold President Kufuor in high esteem. He is a statesman and someone whose leadership and legacy continue to inspire the
New Patriotic Party
and the nation. My political journey has been shaped by the values he championed, and I have never and would never speak against him, the statement read.
Not all went well under his regime - Ama Daaku hits back at Former President Kufuor
The controversy arose after a video clip circulated in which she appeared to challenge Kufuors criticisms of the Akufo-Addo administration.
In the clip, she noted that not everything went smoothly under Kufuors government either, a statement some interpreted as a direct attack.
He (Kufuor) is not supposed to agree with every decision that the former president (Akufo-Addo) made. He had his time; he did it. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo also had his time. Both must be assessed individually on the basis of their deeds and performance in office, she said
Ama Daaku explained that her comments were taken out of context.
She stated that her point was simply that every administration faces challenges, and that it is unfair to expect former leaders to endorse every decision of their successors.
The video being circulated is a short excerpt taken out of context from a much deeper discussion. In that discussion, I was defending the former presidents independence of thought, not criticising him. My point was simple: former President Kufuor is not obliged to agree with every decision taken by the Akufo-Addo administration.
""... A statesman of his stature is entitled to his own reflections, informed by decades of experience. This is a sign of political maturity, not disloyalty, Ama Daaku said in the statement.

3 times Parliament has declared seats vacant in 2025,"Ghanas 9th parliament appears to have faced some turbulent times in 2025, particularly regarding the issue of vacant seats.
Three constituencies have had their lawmakers seats declared vacant due to unfortunate events that occurred within the year.
Akwatia By-Election: Should NDC have pulled out like NPP in Tamale Central?  Data insights
From the demise of MPs to a court declaration, this GhanaWeb article highlights the number of times seats have been declared vacant under the 9th Parliament.
Akwatia Constituency
The constituency was dealt a major blow following the demise of its lawmaker, Ernest Kumi.
In a statement read by the First Deputy Speaker, Bernard Ahiafor, on behalf of the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, on Friday, August 1, 2025, it was announced that Kumi died from heart failure.
Following his demise, his seat was declared vacant in line with Article 112(5) of the 1992 Constitution by the Electoral Commission, which required a by-election.
Tamale Central Constituency
Similar to the Akwatia Constituency, the people of Tamale Central were met with the news of their representatives demise after a tragic helicopter crash on Wednesday, August 6, 2025, claimed his life.
Dr Ibrahim Murtala Mohammed, a former Minister of Environment, Science and Technology (MEST) and seven others, including high profile government officials, met their untimely deaths while enroute to Obuasi in the Ashanti Region aboard a Z-9EH military helicopter.
They were attending the launch of the Responsible Cooperative Mining and Skills Development Programme (rCOMSDEP).
Following the incident, his seat was declared vacant in accordance with the constitution, leading to a by-election.
Kpandai Constituency
The latest constituency to face a vacant seat declaration is the Kpandai Constituency.
This follows a ruling by the High Court in Tamale ordering a rerun of the parliamentary elections in Kpandai.
On November 24, 2025, the court also directed the Electoral Commission to conduct fresh polls within 30 days.
The ruling followed a petition filed by the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) parliamentary candidate, Daniel Nsala Wakpal, challenging the declaration of
Matthew Nyindam
as the Member of Parliament for Kpandai.
Wakpal argued that the December 7, 2024, parliamentary election was fraught with irregularities.
He cited inconsistencies in Pink Sheets (Form 8A) from 41 out of 152 polling stations and asked the court to nullify results from only those affected polling centers.
Parliament officially notifies EC of vacant Kpandai seat
In delivering his verdict, judge Emmanuel Brew Plange, ruled that the irregularities identified were significant enough to affect the integrity of the entire electoral process in the constituency.
He subsequently ordered a complete rerun of the parliamentary election in Kpandai in the next 30 days.

What legacy justifies proposal for a 3rd term for Mahama? - Ofosu Nkansah asks,"Former Chief Executive Officer of the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP), Kofi Ofosu Nkansah, has questioned the basis of suggestions from some individuals proposing that President
John Dramani Mahama
could be considered for a hypothetical third term.
He clarified that although there is no widespread public call for such an extension, the very idea being entertained by a few voices is, in his view, misguided.
In a Facebook post on Wednesday, December 10, 2025, Ofosu Nkansah argued that even entertaining the notion ignores Ghanas constitutional safeguards on presidential tenure and risks shifting attention from more pressing governance issues.
He referenced former President John Agyekum Kufuor to emphasise his point, noting that despite leaving office strong and fit to continue, Kufuor never sought to override the two-term limit.
According to him, even with the solid foundation Kufuor laid for national development, he did not contemplate a third term, demonstrating respect for constitutional order.
Ofosu Nkansah questioned why, by contrast, a similar idea was now being floated around former President Mahama, whose cumulative years in office already exceed five.
He challenged those advancing the suggestion to point to any legacy significant enough to justify a constitutional amendment, dismissing the conversation as selfish and useless.
He warned that attempts to normalise such proposals undermine Ghanas democratic principles and could create a dangerous precedent for future leadership.

Watch how Prophet Nana Bediako predicted the recent parliamentary chaos,"Founder of the Gods Believers Chapel, Prophet Nana Bediako, has once again reinforced his prophetic credentials after accurately predicting the dramatic chaos that disrupted parliamentary proceedings on Tuesday, December 9, 2025.
Prophet Bediako, who has recently gained widespread attention for his prophecy that Dr Mahamudu Bawumia will win the New Patriotic Partys upcoming presidential primaries on January 31, had been invited to Accra-based OK FM on Monday November 8, 2025, to elaborate on his prophecies and explain why they should be taken seriously.
During the live discussion, a spontaneous prophecy emerged.
I see chaos in Parliament. I see two people holding each other, fighting. Chaos erupting in Parliament. I see police and military men trying to intervene.
On December 9, 2025, parliamentary sitting descended into confusion after the Minority staged a loud protest that ground proceedings to a halt.
The disruption was triggered by the Speakers decision to declare the Kpandai Constituency seat vacant a move the Minority insisted was premature due to several pending court cases relating to the matter.
According to them, they could not comprehend why Parliament would rush to pronounce the seat vacant when the legal processes had not been exhausted.
The outbursts, exchanges, and near-clashes that followed forced security personnel to intervene, bringing parliamentary business to a chaotic standstilljust as Prophet Bediako had foretold.
With this latest accurate prediction, the prophet has added yet another layer of credibility to his reputation as a revered seer.
He maintains that Dr Bawumia will emerge victorious in the January 31 presidential flagbearership contest, a prophecy he insists will soon manifest.

"We're not backing down, resistance continues all week  Assafuah after Parliament chaos","Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has stressed that more resistance should be expected from the Minority Caucus for the rest of the week until Parliament withdraws the letters sent to the Electoral Commission declaring the Kpandai seat vacant.
Parliamentary proceedings were disrupted after members of the Minority Caucus abandoned their seats and massed in the centre of the chamber, triggering a brief scuffle and bringing business to a halt.
In an interview with Channel One TV after proceedings on December 9, 2025, Assafuah was asked about the Minoritys next steps, especially since public business eventually commenced despite their resistance.
Minority demands immediate withdrawal of letter to EC declaring Kpandai seat vacant
He explained that the caucus plans to maintain consistent opposition to parliamentary business throughout the week.
According to him, the Minority believes its actions are grounded in constitutional principles.
Vincent Assafuah believes that Parliament's decision directing the Clerk to notify the EC contradicts the Speakers earlier ruling on the matter, raising concerns about consistency and constitutional adherence.
There is going to be a resistance, a consistent resistance, at least for the week. And we are going to do so within the confinement of the law. We believe that we are practising a constitutional supremacy.
""We believe that Ghana is a democratic state. And part of the principles of what constitutional supremacy is, is justice and fairness, Vincent Ekow Assafuah stated.
The chaos in Parliament on December 9, 2025, erupted during heated exchanges over the declaration of the Kpandai parliamentary seat as vacant, a decision the Minority insists is unlawful and procedurally flawed.
Before the disruption, Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga had dismissed the continuous protests by the Minority, saying he was not surprised by what he described as orchestrated attempts to obstruct parliamentary business.
He stated that the Majority would not be distracted by taunts and disruptions that have characterised proceedings since Parliament resumed sitting.
Ayariga accused the Minority of deliberately derailing business over the contested Kpandai seat, arguing that the caucus had resorted to noise-making and disorder to prevent the Speaker from delivering rulings.
He added that there were more decorous and responsible ways for the Minority to express their displeasure without paralysing the House.
Minority Chief Whip Frank Annoh-Dompreh, however, disagreed, insisting that government business would continue to suffer until the Kpandai matter is resolved.

"'If you like, bring the military to beat us' - NPP MP fumes over removal of Kpandai MP","Chaos erupted in Ghanas
Parliament
on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, as the Minority Caucus staged a dramatic protest in a bid to stop what they describe as an unlawful attempt to remove Kpandai MP, Matthew Nyindam, from the House before a final ruling from the Court of Appeal.
The disturbance forced the Speaker of
Parliament
to suspend sitting after Minority MPs abandoned their seats, massed at the centre of the chamber and blocked further proceedings.
Speaking to journalists after the chaotic scenes, the MP for Bosome Freho, Nana Ayeh Asafo-Agyei, has criticised Majority leadership and the
Parliament
ary Service, insisting the Minority would resist any attempt to declare Nyindams seat vacant until the legal process is fully exhausted.
He questioned the legitimacy of a letter issued by the Clerk to
Parliament
to the Electoral Commission declaring the Kpandai seat vacant, describing it as a direct violation of the Speakers earlier ruling that the House must wait for a final judicial outcome.
According to him, the Clerk acted without the authority of the Speaker.
The Speaker cannot give such a ruling, and then we see a letter to the Electoral Commission. It is contradictory to the Speakers own position, he said.
The Bosome Freho MP accused the Majority of using their numerical strength to abuse their power, stressing that the Minority would not allow it.
Until the Speaker instructs that the letter is withdrawn, until the court proceedings are over nobody moves.
If they like, they should bring the military to beat us out. I dont care. We will ensure the right thing is done.
Kpandai Vacant Seat: Speaker Bagbin suspends sitting amid Minority chaos
Nana Ayeh Asafo-Agyei argued that the Clerks action undermines parliamentary precedent and violates clear rulings made during previous disputes involving MPs whose seats were contested in court.
Earlier on the floor, Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga condemned what he described as the Minoritys continuous and orchestrated protest, accusing them of deliberately disrupting parliamentary business.
The Bawku Central MP said he was not surprised by the Minoritys conduct, claiming they were using unruly and noisy tactics to prevent the Speaker from delivering rulings.
The tensions escalated moments after the Majority Leaders statement. Minority MPs rose from their seats, marched to the middle of the chamber and chanted in opposition to the declaration of the Kpandai seat as vacant.
GhanaWeb cameras captured dramatic scenes inside the chamber, including MPs pushing and shouting, papers flying across the floor and Assin South MP Rev John Ntim Fodjour seen angrily yelling at a colleague during the confrontation.

'Akufo-Addo could have cleared out NDC leadership' - Fatimatu on double salary scandal,"Former Minister of Information, Fatimatu Abubakar, has criticised the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) over what she describes as the unfair treatment of former appointees of the erstwhile
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) government who have been accused of corruption.
Speaking on a panel discussion on Movement TV on December 6, 2025, she argued that bail conditions for appointees facing corruption and related charges have now become excessively high, suggesting these measures are being used as punishment rather than a judicial requirement.
According to her, she has lost hope in the country because the legal fraternity has become politicized, especially in the handling of cases involving politically exposed persons.
Abubakar further claimed that former President
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
, under the NPP administration, could have sanctioned the entire leadership of the NDC Members of Parliament (MPs) over the alleged double salary scandal but chose to exercise restraint.
When we were in government, there was the double salary scandal. They had more than fifteen MPs implicated and other issues. If we had taken action, by now almost the entire front bench of the Majority would have been in Nsawam. But the President didnt want that. How do you wipe out the leadership of a whole political party in the name of double salary? she questioned.
She added that despite the governments restraint at the time, todays bail conditions for political appointees are set as high as GH800,000, which she believes reflects political motivation rather than fairness.
I have lost hope in Ghana because it is glaring that what is happening is politically motivated. I have heard the national chairman of the NDC listing all the top political appointments they will sack from the Chief Justice to the Electoral Commission, she claimed.
The double salary issue first surfaced when reports emerged that about 48 Members of Parliament, who served as ministers under then former President
John Dramani Mahama
s administration, had allegedly received double salaries.
The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) of the Ghana Police Service subsequently opened investigations into the claims.
Earlier reports suggested that 25 MPs were invited by the CID for questioning, although further documentation indicated that nearly 48 former NDC appointees were involved with some allegedly admitting to receiving double payments.
The alleged conduct violates Section 124 (1) of the Criminal and Other Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29), which deals with stealing.
Data showed that several ministers took double salaries between 2012 and 2016, with some receiving double payments monthly throughout their tenure. Others did so for shorter periods due to reshuffles.
FLASHBACK: Ex-Ministers exposed in double pay scandal
However, the CID later clarified that investigations had not been suspended, contradicting claims by the then minority MPs who accused the CID of embarrassing them by publicly inviting them for questioning.
The development reportedly caused tension within the NDC. The then Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament and MP for Nadowli/Kaleo, Alban Bagbin, took to Twitter in April 2018, expressing anger at what he suggested were internal leaks to the CID.
If anybody thinks that leaking our names to the police CID thwarts our chances and advances their selfish claim to leadership in our party, then think again. Because when we go down, we go down together, he tweeted at the time.

NPP's Jennifer Queen descends into the gutters with Krontihene of Akyem Asuom,"A Deputy Communications Director of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), Jennifer Oforiwaah Queen, has lambasted the Krontihene of Akyem Asuom, Nana Boadi Amponim Obo-Dade III, over his recent claims that none of the aspirants in the NPP presidential race is qualified to lead the country as president.
Responding to the chief in an interview on Angel TV on December 9, 2025, Jennifer Queen described his comments as filthy.
According to her, she cannot fathom the motivation behind what she called a reckless statement from the traditional leader.
She stated that even if the chief had taken tramadol, she does not believe he would have spoken in such a manner.
Even President Mahama, if Dr Bawumia does something he doesnt like there is a way he would address the issue without openly insulting Dr Bawumia.
President Mahama himself would not insult President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, so how much more you, a chief in a small space who has even been destooled, speaking such filthy words to the party?
Dressing indecently like that and insulting us... The way he is ranting and saying these things, I dont know what is wrong with him, whether he has taken red or something and even that, I doubt he would make such a reckless statement.
The quality of candidates contesting the NPPs flagbearer race has been criticised by the Nana Boadi Amponim Obo-Dade III.
According to the traditional leader, none of the five aspirants demonstrates the leadership depth or character required to lead Ghana as president.
Speaking to the media on December 7, 2025, Nana Boadi Obo-Dade III, known for his blunt commentary on national issues, described the aspirants as sankwas, a term he used to suggest they are unfit for the role.
Why the five NPP presidential candidates dont qualify to be president - Obo-Dade III explains
He contrasted them with past leading figures of the party such as JB Danquah, Victor Owusu, Kofi Busia, Prof Adu-Boahen, Peter Ala Adjetey and JA Kufuor, arguing that the NPP has suffered a decline in leadership quality.
The NPP is scheduled to hold its flagbearer primary on Saturday, January 31, 2026.
The contest features five well-known party figures including former Assin Central MP Kennedy Agyapong, Abetifi MP and former Minister for Agriculture, Dr Bryan Acheampong, former Vice President and 2024 presidential candidate, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, Bosomtwe MP and former Education Minister, Dr Yaw Osei Adutwum and former NPP General Secretary, Kwabena Agyei Agyapong.

NDC wants super Majority to push constitutional amendments - Nkrumah alleges,"The Member of Parliament for Ofoase Ayirebi,
Kojo Oppong Nkrumah
, has accused the governing
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) of pursuing a calculated plan aimed at securing a dominant majority in Parliament to enable changes to the Constitution.
Speaking to journalists in Parliament on December 9, 2025, Oppong Nkrumah compared the current developments to earlier controversial exits in Ghanas public service.
He recalled that before the NDC assumed office, there was what he described as an openly signalled agenda to remove the Chief Justice, which was later carried out under the cover of due process.
'Fight' breaks out in Ghana's parliament
According to him, a similar approach is now being applied to the Electoral Commission.
There is a pre-advertised agenda to remove the EC Chairperson and her deputies. It is being carefully rolled out, and they will keep saying it is all about procedure. If anyone still doubts us, we are saying clearly that there is an agenda to secure an overwhelming majority in this House for the purpose of constitutional amendments, he stated.
Oppong Nkrumah also assured that the Minority will remain resolute and will continue to caution Speaker Alban Bagbin against any pressure to declare the Kpandai seat vacant, stressing that the Speaker has already ruled on the issue.
All we can do is to stand firm and remind Mr Speaker not to give in to any pressure to declare the seat vacant, because he has already made a decision on the matter. No amount of pressure should cause him to reverse that ruling, he said.
His statement come at a time of rising tension in Parliament, following a standoff in which Minority MPs prevented Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga from addressing calls for the withdrawal of a letter that declared the Kpandai parliamentary seat vacant.
The situation led to a temporary suspension of proceedings after Minority MPs, clad in black, chanted slogans, banged tables, and disrupted the sitting.
At the centre of the dispute is a letter dated December 4 from the Clerk of Parliament to Electoral Commission Chairperson Jean Mensa, notifying her of the vacancy of the Kpandai seat after a High Court decision.
The Minority has described the letter as inappropriate and regrettable, arguing that it undermines the rule of law.

'Don't put a microphone in my mouth and call me honourable' - Ahiafor chides Journalist,"The First Deputy Speaker of Parliament,
Bernard Ahiafor
, sharply declined an interview request on Tuesday, insisting that the journalist who approached him breached parliamentary protocol.
After chaos erupted in the chamber during proceedings on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, TV3s correspondent, Christian Yalley, approached
Bernard Ahiafor
who was in the company of some Majority MPs and police officers to seek clarification on the incident.
However, Ahiafor, who also doubles as the Member of Parliament for Akatsi South, rebuked the journalist, stating, You know the procedure. As a speaker, to speak, you know the procedure to follow. I am not the type that you can put a microphone in my mouth and say, Honourable, Honourable. No. Stop this.
Chaos has erupted in Ghanas Parliament during proceedings on Tuesday, after members of the Minority Caucus abandoned their seats and massed at the centre of the chamber.
The disturbance flared during heated exchanges over the declaration of the Kpandai parliamentary seat as vacant, a decision the Minority maintains is unlawful and procedurally flawed.
Before the confrontation, Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga had dismissed what he described as the Minoritys continuous and orchestrated protest, insisting he was not surprised by their attempts to obstruct parliamentary business.
The Bawku Central MP accused the Minority of deliberately derailing parliamentary work over the contested Kpandai seat, arguing that the caucus had resorted to noise-making and unruly behaviour to prevent the Speaker from delivering rulings.
However, Minority Chief Whip Frank Annoh-Dompreh countered sharply, warning that government business would continue to suffer until the Kpandai matter is resolved.
Moments after his remarks, tensions escalated.
'Fight' breaks out in Ghana's parliament
Despite the Speakers attempts to proceed, Minority MPs intensified their protest, rising from their seats, marching into the middle of the chamber and chanting in opposition.

GhanaWeb cameras captured dramatic scenes inside the chamber as MPs in a heated face-off, papers flying through the air and the Member of Parliament for Assin South, Rev Ntim Fodjour, seen angrily yelling at a colleague.

Adwoa Safo rallies Dome-Kwabenya delegates in support of Dr Mahamudu Bawumia,"Former Member of Parliament for Dome-Kwabenya,
Sarah Adwoa Safo
, is expected to address the entire constituency on Sunday, December 14, 2025, in a crucial meeting that brings together all delegates eligible to vote in the
New Patriotic Party
s (NPP) upcoming internal presidential primaries for the 2028 general election.
The three-term MP who remains one of the constituencys most influential political figures is poised to use the gathering to energise grassroots support and consolidate votes for her preferred candidate,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
.
Speaking exclusively to GhanaWeb, Safo underscored the importance of consistency in politics, insisting the NPP has every reason to stick with Dr Bawumia.
Dr Bawumia is now a household name in every nook and cranny of Ghana. Hes well marketed, a popular face that even a toddler can identify with, so why should we bother ourselves going for a candidate who is yet to be marketed? she said.
She added that Dr Bawumias temperament and leadership qualities make him the natural choice for the partys future.
He has demonstrated character, emotional intelligence and the velvet to accommodate all manner of opinions, she emphasised.
Safo further highlighted the Vice Presidents transformational impact on Ghanas digital landscape.
Dr Bawumias touch in leading the digitisation revolution is what has opened Ghana to the rest of the world, making many processes seamless, she noted.
Despite her absence from Parliament, Adwoa Safo continues to command strong loyalty among many constituents.
During her tenure, she spearheaded several development projects that significantly improved livelihoods in Dome-Kwabenya.
Many party faithful still attribute the constituencys poor performance in the 2024 elections to the decision not to retain her as parliamentary candidate.
As the NPP heads into another decisive internal contest, Adwoa Safos re-emergence is expected to re-energise the base and shape the dynamics within one of the partys largest constituencies.

Fuel-on-credit is proof of Bawumia's visionary digital architecture  Dr Amoakoh,"A Deputy Spokesperson for former Vice-President
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, Dr Ekua Amoakoh, has hailed the newly launched Fuel Now, Pay Later initiative as concrete evidence of what she describes as Dr Bawumias visionary digital architecture that continues to transform lives even while he is out of office.
In a statement titled Building the Credit-Friendly Economy Ghana Deserves, on December 9, 2025, Dr Amoakoh argued that Ghanas transition toward a credit-driven economy is not only achievable but already unfoldingthanks to the digital foundations laid under Dr Bawumias leadership.
I have long advocated for the transformational impact a shift toward a more credit-friendly economy can have on national development, she wrote, stressing that access to credit is not just about convenience, it is about unlocking opportunity, improving the quality of life for millions and stimulating sustainable economic growth.
According to her, the former Vice-Presidents digitisation agendaparticularly the Ghana Card, the national digital address system and mobile money interoperability was intentionally designed to support a modern and inclusive economy.
These interventions, she noted, were not conceived as isolated initiatives.
They were deliberate, interconnected building blocks designed to support the modern, efficient, opportunity-driven Ghana we all aspire to build.
Dr Amoakoh said the essence of a credit-friendly economy is its ability to empower citizens by expanding their purchasing power and stimulating domestic demand.
That demand, in turn, boosts local production, fuels entrepreneurship, and strengthens the private sector, she explained, describing it as a natural cycle of economic vibrancy, far more practical and impactful than the phantom so-called 24-hour economy.
She pointed to the fuel-on-credit system introduced by Star Oil as a direct outcome of these digital structures.
Today, even while Dr Bawumia is in opposition, we are witnessing a shining example of this vision materialising in real time, she stated.
Thanks to the very digital infrastructure he championed, companies like Star Oil have been able to introduce a seamless system that allows drivers to purchase fuel on credit.
Dr Amoakoh highlighted the simplicity and efficiency of the system, quoting the step-by-step process to illustrate how digital interoperability is enabling real economic empowerment.
According to her, the process is straightforward: the driver arrives at the fuel station, an attendant verifies the drivers Ghana Card and confirms their identity through NIA Face ID, after which the system instantly runs a credit check via the myCreditScore platform.
If approved, the driver buys fuel using their MoMo wallet without paying immediately and after eight hours the drivers wallet is automatically debited.
Once repayment is completed, the system unlocks the ability for the driver to make the next purchase.
She emphasised that this entire process identity verification, credit scoring, interoperability and automated payments is made possible because the digital rails already exist. Rails that were designed, constructed, and operationalised under Dr Bawumias leadership.
Calling the system the digital economy in action, Dr Amoakoh insisted it demonstrated not future promises but present realities.
This is credit access in motion. This is empowerment made real, she declared.
Dr Amoakoh further stated that if such innovation is possible even before Dr Bawumia has the chance to implement a full credit-led national economic agenda, then a national mandate would unlock even greater transformation.
Imagine what becomes possible when this vision is given the mandate and scale it deserves. Ghana is already stepping into its future. We must now choose to accelerate it, she added.'",,Politics,  9 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Fuel-on-credit-is-proof-of-Bawumia-s-visionary-digital-architecture-Dr-Amoakoh-2012956
Kpandai Vacant Seat: Speaker Bagbin suspends sitting amid Minority chaos,"Parliament
ary proceedings were suspended following an uproar on the floor of the House when the Minority caucus blocked Majority Leader
Mahama Ayariga
from responding to calls for the withdrawal of a letter declaring the Kpandai parliamentary seat vacant.
The disruption came after
Parliament
formally notified the
Electoral Commission
on Monday, December 8, 2025, that the seat had become vacant, in accordance with a High Court ruling ordering a rerun of the constituencys election.
The Minority, dressed in black, chanted patriotic songs, banged tables, and hooted at the Clerk of

Minority demands immediate withdrawal of letter to EC declaring Kpandai seat vacant
The controversy stems from a letter dated December 4, 2025, from the Clerk to

Chairperson Jean Mensa, informing her of the vacancy.
Speaking on the floor of
Parliament
, the Minority Chief Whip, Frank Annoh Dompreh, described the letter as out of place and unfortunate, arguing that it violated the rule of law and insisting that it be withdrawn.
""We strongly submit that the letter filed with the

Parliament
(MPs) from the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) on Tuesday December 9, 2025 erupted into loud chants of Djietror must go!, demanding the immediate resignation of the Acting Clerk to
Parliament
, Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror.
The protest followed the Clerks formal communication to the

Clad in black to signal their displeasure, the NPP legislators rose to their feet as proceedings began, chanting and calling for the Clerks removal.
Minority demands immediate withdrawal of letter to EC declaring Kpandai seat vacant
The atmosphere in the chamber grew tense as MPs accused Djietror of acting without proper authorisation and undermining due parliamentary process.
The Clerks letter to the EC was issued after a High Court ruling that annulled the 2024 parliamentary election results for Kpandai and ordered a rerun.
However, NPP MPs argue that the ruling is still subject to appeal and that the mandatory window for a stay of execution has not lapsed, making any declaration of vacancy premature.
Some MPs further claimed that the Clerks action could influence the political balance in the House and risk setting a dangerous precedent for future electoral disputes.

Minority demands immediate withdrawal of letter to EC declaring Kpandai seat vacant,"The Minority Caucus in
Parliament
has demanded the immediate withdrawal of the official letter notifying the Electoral Commission (EC) of a vacancy in the Kpandai Constituency.
Speaking on the floor on Tuesday, December 9, 2025, the Minority Chief Whip and MP for Nsawam Adoagyiri, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, described the letter as out of place, unfortunate, and contrary to law and procedural justice.
Gary Nimako slams
Parliament
for hasty declaration of vacant seat in Kpandai
Speaker, we strongly submit that the letter, which was out of place, was unfortunate, and flies in the face of law and procedural justice. We submit strongly to this House that the letter must be withdrawn by
Parliament
forthwith, and we must act and stay consistent with the pronouncements of the chair, for that matter, the Speaker, on this same matter.
We, in the minority, do not agree to the writing of this letter. We take a strong position that the letter must be withdrawn forthwith, and as a cradle of democracy, we must be seen to be setting a very good example for the populace of this country to follow suit. Speaker, I submit to you that the letter declaring the Kpandai seat vacant must be recalled immediately. The situation cannot, and we on this side of the House cannot support that decision, he said.
The Minoritys demand follows a letter dated December 4, 2025, signed by Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror, the Clerk to
Parliament
, and addressed to the Chairperson of the EC, Jean Mensah, informing her of the vacant Kpandai seat.
The letter stated, In exercise of the power conferred and the duty imposed on the Clerk to

Martin Kpebu is attacking OSP because he's in Mahama's pocket  Maurice Ampaw,"Lawyer Maurice Ampaw has criticised fellow legal practitioner Martin Kpebu over what he describes as an attack on the Special Prosecutor, Kissi Agyebeng.
According to Ampaw, the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) government is seeking to remove the Special Prosecutor and Martin Kpebu is allegedly being used to facilitate that agenda.
He claims Kpebu has shown gross disrespect toward the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) and its head, Kissi Agyebeng, because President
John Dramani Mahama
appointed him as a member of the Operation Recover All Loot (ORAL) task force, an appointment Ampaw believes places Kpebu in the pocket of the president.
Ampaw alleged that Kpebu has repeatedly made unfounded accusations against the OSP and reacts inappropriately whenever he is asked to provide evidence, often disrupting proceedings.
He insisted that because of Kpebus ties to the presidency and his perceived alignment with the ruling government, he has become emboldened.
The NDC want to remove the Special Prosecutor, and Martin Kpebu is being used.
Martin Kpebu released after hours in OSP custody
He has made several allegations against the OSP without any evidence. He should have been arrested by the OSP. What he engaged in was cyberbullying. And when the OSP called him to provide evidence of his allegations, he started misbehaving because he is an ORAL member appointed by President
John Dramani Mahama
and he is in his pocket, Ampaw claimed.
So, he went to the office with a disrespectful attitude. He didnt respect the office or the Special Prosecutor. He approached them arrogantly because his government is in power.
Ampaw further accused Kpebu of staging media attention to insult Kissi Agyebeng before honouring an invitation to the OSP.
Because he doesnt respect anybody and because of his arrogance, he organised the media to follow him and insult Kissi Agyebeng ahead of his meeting. He granted interviews on the premises and insulted the Office even before he went in, just to provoke the workers. What he did could have warranted an arrest for offensive conduct, he added.
Martin Kpebu was released after spending nearly five hours in the custody of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) on Wednesday, December 3, 2025.
He was detained on allegations of obstructing an officer of the OSP.
Speaking to TV3 shortly after his release, Kpebu described the detention as unwarranted, insisting he had committed no offence.
I know I have not done anything wrong, so I knew I would be released, he stated.
Kpebu explained that the incident leading to his arrest stemmed from a verbal confrontation with a military officer stationed at the OSP.
According to him, the officer verbally abused him, prompting a heated exchange.
Then the next thing, the soldier said I am stupid, so I also turned and said he is also stupid and so we exchanged words, he recounted.
In recent weeks, Martin Kpebu has intensified his criticism of the Special Prosecutor, accusing him of contradicting himself in matters involving former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta.
On TV3s The KeyPoints on November 29, 2025, he insisted that the OSPs claim that the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) refused to help arrest Ofori-Atta had been exposed as untrue.
The head of an anti-corruption agency cannot lie to citizens, run down state institutions without evidence, and still expect to hold office. If this was a slip, he should have admitted it. The fact that he keeps defending it shows it was deliberate, he argued.
Kpebu said he independently verified the OSPs assertions by speaking to current and former NIB officials, and none confirmed receiving any request for assistance.
He also referenced a written response from the NIB dated November 27, 2025, which stated clearly that the Bureau did not receive any formal request for assistance to arrest Ofori-Atta.

'Many said it was not possible'  Bawumia reacts to new fuel-on-credit scheme,"Former Vice President,
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
has commended Star Oil Ghana Limited for embracing the individualised credit scoring system, which he launched for Ghana, to enable drivers buy fuel on credit.
Star Oil on Monday December 8, 2025, announced a new scheme, which allows drivers to use their Ghanacard to register on the my credit score app, and then buy fuel on credit, which they can pay later through their mobile money accounts.
The individualised credit scoring  system, the Ghanacard and the interoperable mobile money  system, which allows for seamless payments, were all championed by Bawumia when he served as Vice President, and with Star Oil combining using the three in their new scheme for drivers, he expressed his excitement for the benefits it brings to Ghanaians.
""I congratulate Star Oil Ghana Ltd., and its bold and visionary CEO, for  launching their Fuel Now, Pay Later scheme today,  which makes  it possible for Ghanaians, especially drivers, to be able to buy fuel on credit using their Ghanacard through the individualised credit scoring system. When I launched this initiative last year, many skeptics did not see it as possible,"" Dr Bawumia said.
Dr Bawumia underscored the importance of an efficient credit economy, adding that it is the reason he championed the building of a strong foundation for a credit economy in Ghana, to help businesses offer credit options to Ghanaians to make life a easier.
""A credit economy is so vital in making life a lot less stressful for many people  in advanced economies. Thankfully, in Ghana we have put in place the critical foundational pillars to underpin an efficient credit economy using the Ghanacard as an anchor, and supported by pillars such as the digital address system, our interoperable mobile money payment system, and the individualized credit scoring system.
""I look forward to other OMCs and businesses embracing the individualised credit scoring system to give Ghanaian workers the much-needed option of buying goods and services on credit and paying for them with ease through their Ghanacard and credit score as Star Oil Ghana has done,"" he stated.

Asiedu Nketiah should not contest NDC flagbearership  Krontihene of Akyem Asuom,"NDC National Chairman
Johnson Asiedu Nketiah
has been urged by the Krontihene of Akyem Asuom, Nana Boadi Amponim Obo-dade III, to reconsider reports that he intends to contest the partys flagbearer slot.
Speaking to journalists at his palace on December 7, 2025, the chief said that following the death of former President Jerry John Rawlings, the founder of the NDC, Asiedu Nketiah has assumed the role of a unifying figure, which he described as the Abusuapanyin, within the party.
He explained that, in his view, the Abusuapanyin position places a responsibility on Asiedu Nketiah to prioritise party unity rather than pursue a presidential ambition.
ORAL must last beyond 2028 - Kontihene of Asuom
Nana Boadi warned that a decision by the NDC chairman to enter the flagbearer race could trigger internal divisions and weaken the party ahead of the 2028 general elections.
The traditional leader further encouraged him to focus on guiding and mentoring emerging leaders within the NDC, while supporting reforms that would help strengthen the party and the wider political system.
I sincerely hope he does not contest the flagbearership, Nana Boadi said. Since President Rawlings passed on, Asiedu Nketiah has become our Abusuapanin, the family head. And when a contest begins, if the Abusuapanin is not careful and decides to compete, it can divide and destroy the family.
He should serve as the central pillar that holds everyone together. If President John Mahama does not contest, there will be a rush for the position, and the NDC can only lose 2028 if it allows itself to fall apart. I wish Asiedu Nketiah would be the glue that brings all the competing interests together, he urged.
Watch the video below:
@khodedmedia_
Nana Obodade, the Krontihene of Akyem Asuom, has advised Asiedu Nketiah to reconsider any ambition of contesting for flagbearer, stressing that the current political climate demands unity, renewal, and strategic leadership. The traditional leader noted that leadership should not be driven by personal ambition, but by a clear vision that reflects the aspirations of the Ghanaian people. He urged Asiedu Nketiah to focus on mentoring the next generation of leaders and supporting reforms that will strengthen the political system, rather than entering a divisive contest.

Not all went well under his regime - Ama Daaku hits back at Former President Kufuor,"Aide to former Vice President
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
, Ellen Ama Daaku, has said former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
does not need to agree with every policy decision taken by former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, adding that not everything went well under Kufuors administration either.
Speaking on Metro TVs Good Morning Ghana on December 9, 2025, Ellen Ama Daaku explained that President Kufuor had his own time in office and governed according to his convictions. While Ghanaians appreciate his contributions to national development, she noted that his administration, like any other, was not without challenges.
According to her, both Kufuor and Akufo-Addo must be assessed individually on the basis of their deeds and performance in office, making it unreasonable to expect Kufuor to endorse every decision taken during Akufo-Addos tenure.
I didn't understand Akufo-Addo's leadership  Former President Kufuor
He (Kufuor) is not supposed to agree with every decision that the former president (Akufo-Addo) made. He had his time; he did it. Nana Addo Dankwa also had his presidency; he had his time. We are going to evaluate every one of them by their deeds and their work. I believe that Kufuor did well for himself. Fifteen years down the line, we are all looking at what he did for us as Ghanaians, and we appreciate it. Was everything okay during his regime? No. Did he have issues? Yes. He doesnt have to agree with everything that Nana Addo did, she said.
Her comments come after former President Kufuor criticised the Akufo-Addo administration over some troubling policy choices, which he believes contributed to the New Patriotic Partys defeat in the 2024 general elections.
Speaking on The Delay Show, Kufuor said he never understood the rationale behind key decisions such as the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), the National Cathedral project, and the Power Distribution Services deal, adding that he was not consulted on any of them.
He further noted that the NPPs return to power in 2016 was largely driven by the record and achievements of his administration.
Before the 2016 election in which Akufo-Addo was elected, the campaign was built on my achievements. Those achievements played a key role in his victory. The government started on a good note, but things changed after he assumed power, Kufuor said.

I don't understand why Mahama declared he wont run for a third term  Kwame A-Plus,"Member of Parliament for Gomoa Central, Kwame Asare Obeng, popularly known as Kwame A-Plus, said he cannot wrap his head around President
John Dramani Mahama
s declaration that he has no intention of seeking a third term.
Speaking in a recent interview shared on social media, A-Plus praised Mahama but said he could not understand why the president made the announcement, noting that no one had asked him to make such a statement.
When asked whether Mahama should have amended the constitution to run for a third term, A-Plus questioned whether countries like China or the UAE would have achieved their level of development if they held elections as frequently as Ghana does.
President Mahama announces 'plans' for 2028 presidential run
I dont even understand why Mahama said he wouldnt contest for a third term. Do you think China would have developed if elections were held every four years? People would just sit on social media writing long posts about the constitution and other issues. Do you think the UAE would be doing so well if elections were held every four years? he asked.
He added that one of Africas biggest challenges is how democracy is practised on the continent.
The biggest problem in Africa is the kind of democracy we practice. Democracy is about consensus-building, and as long as we can reach consensus, thats democracy. In the Western world, they built their countries before introducing democracy, he said.
President Mahama, in August 2025, reaffirmed his commitment to Ghanas two-term presidential limit, insisting that he will not appear on the ballot in 2028 for a third term.

'Let's choose unity over division' - Dr Opoku Prempeh urges Bono executives,"The running mate of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) in the 2024 general elections and former Energy Minister, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has called for deeper unity, discipline and civility within the party as it prepares for its upcoming internal contests.
In an inspirational message shared on his official Facebook page, Dr Prempeh revealed that he had engaged Regional and Constituency Executives in the Bono Region, where he underscored the urgent need for members to avoid insults, hostility and divisive rhetoric during the primaries.
According to him, the NPPs greatest strength has always been its ability to remain united under one banner, Development in Freedom and that this must guide the conduct of all party actors.
This is a home contest, he said. Once the primaries are over, we will need every member standing firmly behind the elephant to drive our electoral agenda. Unity is not optional; it is the foundation on which we build victory.
Dr Prempeh stressed that discipline and mutual respect are essential for rebuilding trust and strengthening internal cohesion ahead of the 2024 polls.
He urged party communicators, executives and grassroots members alike to be guided by the higher interest of the NPP and Ghana.
He also encouraged delegates to rally behind Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, describing him as a leader whose record of competence, service and dedication positions him strongly to steer the party confidently into its next chapter.
Our future is brighter when we move together. With unity of purpose and clarity of vision, we will secure victory and deliver hope for Ghana, he added.
Dr Prempeh ended his message with a renewed call for collective responsibility and positive campaigning, assuring party supporters that the NPP remains the party of progress, opportunity and national renewal.",,Politics,  9 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/Let-s-choose-unity-over-division-Dr-Opoku-Prempeh-urges-Bono-executives-2012818
"NACOC nabs 3 in connection with 1,158kg suspected cocaine shipment to Belgium","The Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC) has arrested three individuals believed to be directly connected to a 1,158-kilogram consignment of a substance suspected to be cocaine that was shipped from Ghana to the Port of Antwerp in Belgium.
The arrests were made on 4 December 2025 following weeks of coordinated intelligence operations between Ghanaian security agencies and their Belgian counterparts, who intercepted the suspected narcotics upon arrival in Europe.
Officials say the seizure is one of the largest international drug-linked cases traced back to Ghana this year.
According to NACOC, the three suspects are alleged to have played key roles in the preparation, documentation, and export of the shipment, which had been disguised as legitimate cargo.
Early investigative findings suggest the consignment may be connected to a wider transnational drug-trafficking network operating across multiple ports in West Africa.
Security sources indicate that Belgian authorities alerted NACOC after detecting anomalies in the container, leading to a swift trace-back operation that culminated in the arrests.
NACOC says a full-scale investigation is underway to uncover additional accomplices and establish the depth of the network behind the attempted export.
The commission has reiterated its commitment to strengthening port surveillance and enhancing cooperation with international partners to combat drug trafficking.
It also urged freight operators, shipping agents, and members of the public to remain vigilant and report suspicious activities as Ghana intensifies efforts to curb the trafficking of illicit substances.",,Politics,  9 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/NACOC-nabs-3-in-connection-with-1-158kg-suspected-cocaine-shipment-to-Belgium-2012807
This is the real picture' - Dr Kpikpi says 2025 WASSCE reflects long-standing decline,"The 2024 Presidential Candidate of the Progressive Alliance of Ghana (PAG), Dr John Kpikpi, has suggested that the poor WASSCE results recorded this year may be a more accurate reflection of Ghanas educational performance, one that has long been concealed by widespread examination malpractice.
Speaking in an interview on Metro TVs Good Afternoon Ghana programme, Dr Kpikpi said the latest results, which have sparked a national debate, should not surprise anyone who understands the depth of malpractice that has taken root in schools across the country.
He argued that for years, unethical practices during examinations have created an illusion of academic excellence.
Dr Kpikpi explained that many parents openly pay illegal fees to teachers and schools, who in turn collaborate with invigilators to influence exam outcomes.
According to him, this practice has become so entrenched that it has misled the nation into believing students were performing better than they actually were.
He commended the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) for what appears to be a renewed effort this year to clamp down on cheating, which he believes has exposed the true state of academic performance in the country.
Dr Kpikpi insisted that rather than lamenting the decline in results, stakeholders should confront the uncomfortable reality revealed by stricter supervision and use it as a turning point to address deep-seated problems in the education system.
I wonder whether these results weve seen now are actually the real results that we shall be receiving all these years, but they have been masked by serious exam malpractice, which is entrenched and practised across this country.
""In most schools, parents happily pay money and schools receive money from parents to buy invigilators.
""In fact, it has become the norm. It looks like this year, WAEC found a way to dig in and tackle all of these, and the result is what is coming out without the mask on it. He concluded with a firm observation.""",,Politics,  8 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/This-is-the-real-picture-Dr-Kpikpi-says-2025-WASSCE-reflects-long-standing-decline-2012791
Parliament officially notifies EC of vacant Kpandai seat,"Parliament
has formally notified the Electoral Commission (EC) of vacancy regarding the Kpandai parliamentary seat, following a recent court order for a rerun of the 2024 parliamentary elections in the constituency.
In a letter dated December 4, 2025, signed by Ebenezer Ahumah Djietror, the Clerk to
Parliament
and addressed to the Chairperson of the EC, Jean Mensah, it stated;
In exercise of the power conferred and the duty imposed on the Clerk to
Parliament
by Article 112(5) of the 1992 Constitution, I hereby formally notify you of the occurrence of a vacancy in the membership of
Parliament
, occasioned by the Order of the High Court, Tamale, for a rerun of the Kpandai
Parliament
ary Elections, given on November 24, 2025.""
The development has officially triggered the process for the EC to organise a rerun in the Kpandai Constituency, as mandated by law.
On November 24, 2025, the Tamale High Court ordered a rerun of the parliamentary election in the Kpandai constituency, directing the Electoral Commission to conduct fresh polls within 30 days.
Kpandai MP speaks on High Court's election rerun decision
The ruling followed a petition filed by the
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) parliamentary candidate, Daniel Nsala Wakpal, challenging the declaration of
Matthew Nyindam
as the Member of
Parliament
for Kpandai.
Wakpal argued that the December 7, 2024, parliamentary election was fraught with irregularities.
He cited inconsistencies in Pink Sheets (Form 8A) from 41 out of 152 polling stations and asked the court to nullify results from only those affected polling centers.

Miracles Aboagye slams government over U-turn on $60m presidential jet purchase,"A Spokesperson for former Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, Dennis Miracles Aboagye, has criticised the government over reports that it is acquiring a new $60 million presidential jet, describing the move as a sin, a crime, and disrespectful to the people.
In a Facebook post on December 6, 2025, Aboagye said the governing
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) had lost its moral authority after previously condemning the renting or purchase of presidential aircraft on grounds of cost, poverty, and the availability of a functional jet.
You said renting a plane was wrong because the current presidential jet was in pristine condition. You said buying a plane was wrong because the country was poor. Then under 11 months, you turn around to buy a more expensive presidential jet for the president to bath and cook in the air? And you think this is funny? he asked.
NDCs Dela Coffie justifies purchase of presidential jets amid backlash
Aboagye accused the government of abandoning key campaign promises while prioritising what he called luxury and excess.
He cited unposted nurses and teachers, rising utility prices, high cost of living, and widespread job losses as evidence that the government was out of touch with ordinary Ghanaians.
At the time you want to buy this luxurious presidential jet, the nurses and teachers you promised automatic postings are still at home. You have burdened citizens with over 28% increase in utilities, he said, adding that inflation and the exchange rate improvements had not translated into lower prices.
According to him, the termination of about 35,000 young workers further undermines any justification for purchasing what he described as an Arabian king standard aircraft.
Aboagye insisted the decision exposes what he termed long-standing inconsistencies and poor governance.
Some of us are not surprised because we always knew what you were. Its the Gen Zs who trusted you and your lies that are learning the hard way, he stated.
He urged the administration to get serious, honour its promises, and focus on alleviating economic hardship rather than making jokes of serious matters.

We are saddled with you for the next three years with no option, and we have no choice than to remind you of your sacred promises, he stated.
Aboagye stressed that spending $60 million on a presidential jet under the current economic pressures is unacceptable.
What happened to honour and principles? Time is up. Get to work the citizens are suffering, he said.

"NDC welcomes Kufuors criticism of NPP, questions timing of his remarks","The
National Democratic Congress
(NDC) has reacted to recent comments by former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
, describing them as a rare but important admission of governance failures under the New Patriotic Party (NPP) led by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
In a statement signed by Deputy National Communications Officer, Godwin Ako Gunn, the NDC said former President Kufuors reflections confirm what the party has long assertedthat the Akufo-Addo administration was marked by arrogance, poor judgment, and reckless management of the state.
According to the statement,  President Kufuor acknowledged that the NPP rode on the legacy of his administration to win power in 2016 but later abandoned prudent policies and implemented decisions that worsened the living conditions of Ghanaians.
The NDC highlighted Kufuors claim of being sidelined on major national decisions, including the disputed National Cathedral project, the controversial Domestic Debt Exchange programme, and scandals such as the Power Distribution Services (PDS) case.
These admissions confirm what the NDC consistently highlighted during the period of governance: that the NPP was driven by arrogance, unilateralism, and disregard for collective wisdom, the statement said.
However, the NDC also questioned the timing of Kufuors remarks, arguing that his silence during the peak of alleged mismanagement contributed to the hardship of Ghanaians.
His recent comments, though welcome, come only after the NPP has suffered electoral defeat and internal disunity.
""This raises legitimate questions about why he chose not to speak when Ghanaians most needed his voice, the statement read.
The NDC reiterated its philosophy that governance must prioritise accountability, consultation, and the welfare of citizens over what it called vanity projects and partisan interests.
The party stated that Kufuors remarks reinforce its position that the NPP has failed the country.
As Ghana looks ahead, the statement assured citizens that the NDC is prepared to offer leadership that is honest, accountable, and people-centred.
Ghana deserves better. Ghana deserves leadership that is honest, accountable, and people-centred.
""That is the leadership the NDC offers, it concluded.",,Politics,  8 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/NDC-welcomes-Kufuor-s-criticism-of-NPP-questions-timing-of-his-remarks-2012709
'I never supported Alan against anybody'  Kufuor rejects 2008 bias claims,"Former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
has dismissed long-standing claims that he supported Alan Kyerematen over
Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo
in the
New Patriotic Party
s (NPP) presidential primaries ahead of the 2008 Election.
In an interview on The Delay Show, Kufuor described the rumours as unfounded and unfair, insisting he never worked against Akufo-Addo nor provided any form of support to boost Alans campaign.
I never supported him against anybody. I didnt give him anything to aid him go and defeat anybody, he indicated.
The plot against me by some NPP members is similar to the rivalry you're seeing now - Kufuor
Kufuor also stated that the narrative had persisted for years despite lacking any factual basis.
He stressed that he maintained strict neutrality in all internal party contests during his tenure.
Recounting events after the NPPs 2000 electoral victory, the former president disclosed that he had actually attempted to bring Kyerematen into his government, but the latter declined the ministerial offer.
When I contacted him to make him a minister, he turned down the offer, Kufuor said.
His clarification comes at a time when internal party debates have resurfaced following the NPPs defeat in the 2024 general elections.
I didn't understand Akufo-Addo's leadership  Former President Kufuor
Kufuor also offered candid criticism of the Akufo-Addo administration, citing the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), the PDS controversy, and the National Cathedral project as policy setbacks that significantly weakened public confidence in the government.
He noted that while the administration began on a strong footing, decisions taken after the COVID-19 pandemic raised serious concerns among voters.
According to him, this represented a departure from the momentum built in 2016, when the NPP campaigned heavily on the achievements of his own government, a foundation he believes contributed substantially to the partys credibility at the time.

Dr Bawumia will win NPP flagbearer race - Prophet Emmanuel Worlasi declares,"Prophet Emmanuel Worlasi, Head Pastor of Conquerors Chapel International, Kumasi Branch,has confidently declared that former Vice President
Dr Mahamudu Bawumia
will emerge as the flagbearer of the
New Patriotic Party
(NPP), describing the revelation as a clear message from God backed by multiple confirmations.
He noted that all the NPP presidential hopefuls know him personally, and he has privately shared with them what he believes is the divine verdict on the outcome of the contest.
He stressed that he does not take money to issue favourable prophecies and that his ministry, legacy, and integrity are his priority.
The prophet said he is already blessed with a stable life and family and therefore has no reason to compromise his calling for financial gain.
According to him, Dr Bawumia would win 14 out of the 16 regions, including the Ashanti Region, and would still triumph regardless of whether the primary is held today, tomorrow, or January 31, 2026.
Prophet Worlasi further prophesied that January 2026 would bring a major shock to the camp of Kennedy Agyapong, a development he says will break the spirit of the group and make their eventual defeat unmistakable well before the national elections.
He added that further details would be released during his 31st Night Service.
He referenced previous prophecies he made ahead of the last general elections, including a prediction that the NDC would win massivelyeven in the Ashanti Regionand secure a strong parliamentary majority.
Internal Wrangling, Tough Times, Division: Prophet Worlasi drops 'bombshell' about NDC
He also recalled foretelling the defeat of former Hohoe Member of Parliament, Peter Amewu, a prophecy many initially doubted until it came to pass.
The prophet dismissed claims that his current declaration is influenced by alleged sponsorship from Dr Bawumia and his wife, Hajia
Samira Bawumia
, during his wedding.
He explained that even in 2024, he had prophesied their electoral loss, which later materialised, proving that he does not tailor his spiritual messages to please or reward individuals.
He added that people from Kennedy Agyapongs camp had approached him for engagement, but he declined due to the clarity of the revelation he had already received.
Prophet Worlasi attributed Dr Bawumias spiritual advantage to what he described as the former Vice Presidents good heart, insisting that divine selection is based on inward qualities rather than outward appearances.
He noted that he would not be surprised if Dr Bawumia eventually ascends to the presidency in the future, although he prefers not to draw premature conclusions about the 2028 elections.
Why Dr Bawumia continues to receive strong backing from NPP MPs
He reiterated that he continues to pray over the prophecy to ensure its fulfilment and that he does not abandon revelations after declaring them publicly.
The prophet, who claims a record of accurately predicting major international events such as the deaths of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, Queen Elizabeth II, and Theresa Kufuor, insisted that he stands firmly by what he has seen.
Whenever I receive a revelation, I seek several confirmations before coming out to declare it, he said.
When I speak, I stand by it, because my ministry and integrity are at stake.
He urged the public to wait for January 31, 2026, stating that the unfolding events will further validate his prophetic accuracy.

The plot against me by some NPP members is similar to the rivalry you're seeing now - Kufuor,"Former President
John Agyekum Kufuor
has likened the bitter rivalry in the ongoing NPP Presidential Campaign to his own situation nearly 30 years ago, after he lost his first shot at the Presidency.
In the 1996 Presidential election, Kufuor contested for the first time as the NPP's Flagbearer, but he lost to President Rawlings, securing 39% of the votes  a situation which he said led to some members of the party calling for him not to be presented again as the party's candidate.
In an exclusive interview with the Delay Show, the former President said the plot against him was so thick that some members of the party went to the extent of spreading wild propaganda against him, including falsely accusing him of diverting campaign funds into his private accounts in the US  all in a bid not to get him to be presented again.
""When they declared I had 39% and I think that was exceptional,"" Kufuor said of his first attempt at the Presidency in 1996.
""Rawlings won but for the next election he was not allowed to run and he had to step down. Even before that, some people in my party wanted to see the back of me.""
""So they came up with all sorts of propaganda against me. One of it, they said I embarked on a tour of America and party supporters gave me $100,000 which they alleged that I had put in my private account but it was a big lie.""
President Kufuor added that the allegation was so serious that a committee was set up to investigate it.
I didn't understand Akufo-Addo's leadership  Former President Kufuor
""Even the then Chairman of the party, Peter Ala Adjetey, set up a committee under Mr. A. K. Deku, one of our elders, to investigate me. Those who made these serious allegations against me  one has died and one is alive  could not provide any evidence when they were called to substantiate their claim.""
""Some members of the party had their own schemes against me, similar to the kind of rivalries you see in the contest now.""
""I was free when the committee could not find anything against me, and the party subsequently met in Sunyani in 1998 to pick a candidate.""
Following his renomination by the party in 1998 as its flagbearer for the second time, Kufuor went on to win the next election in the year 2000 and won again in 2004 to complete his second term in office.

Prof Kwaku Asare, who is popularly known as Kwaku Azar, in a post shared on Facebook on December 7, 2025, appeared to question the rationale of former President Kufuors criticism.
He pointed out that even though Kufuors remarks might be right, they are coming a little too late.
Kufuor admits he didnt understand NADAAs leadership. Hes clearly not alone. But why do we speak when its too late? he wrote.

expressed disappointment in the performance of the Akufo-Addoled administration, particularly in the period after the COVID19 pandemic.
In an interview with Deloris Frimpong Manso, shared on X on December 6, 2025, former President Kufuor noted that although Akufo-Addo started his administration on a promising note, his government began to perform poorly after the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the former president, the Akufo-Addo government implemented policies without consulting him, adding that he could not fathom many of the approaches taken by the ousted NPP administration.

He further explained that Akufo-Addo's style of leadership contributed to the NPPs defeat in the 2024 general election.
""During the 2016 election, they rode on my achievements to win power, but after they came into government, things changed... They started very well, but when COVID-19 came, things began to shift. I will commend him for how he handled the COVID-19 pandemic, but afterward, I didnt understand many of the things they were doing.
""Things like the bond market and the national cathedral... They didnt consult me. All I knew was that they were building it. I initially thought it was a private initiative, only to later realize they were using government resources. They even demolished the judges building for it, and yet they still couldnt complete it,"" he said.

"NPP urged to withdraw from 2028 general elections, seek group counseling","A Presidential Aide, Rosemond Obeng, has called on the hierarchy of the opposition
New Patriotic Party
(NPP) to consider boycotting the 2028 general elections for their own good.
She added that the party should undergo group counseling to recover from the shock of the 2024 elections, which sent them into opposition.
Madam Obeng believes this could be the best advice for the NPP as part of its regrouping process, stressing that their comeback is not a short-term approach.
I want to offer advice to the NPP in a humble approach. It seems the shock they had with the defeat in the 2024 elections is still haunting them, so I will recommend group counseling for them.
Moreover, it would have been better if they should boycott the 2028 general elections because while going through the counselling period to fix their brains, they will need more than four years to do that.
Thats my little but humble advice I have for them, she urged, speaking on Angel TV on November 13, 2025.
Madam Obeng, also a member of the government communications team, explained that her charitable advice is intended to strengthen Ghanas democracy.
This couldve been none of the business of the NDC, but we are much concerned about their state and for the sake of democracy as we look forward to administering the country with them.
She emphasised, Yes, they should work on their brains, adding that the behaviour of the NPP does not suggest an opposition party seeking to reclaim power.",,Politics,  8 December 2025,https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/politics/NPP-urged-to-withdraw-from-2028-general-elections-seek-group-counseling-2012633

John Dramani Mahama
has expressed profound gratitude to Ghanaians as he marked exactly one year since the decisive December 7, 2024 general elections, describing the day as one when the nation 'spoke with a powerful voice.'
In a press statement issued on Sunday December 7, 2025, the President recalled the anxiety, hope, and determination that characterised the 2024 polls, noting that millions of voters stood in long queues with unwavering faith in the promise of national renewal.
He thanked the electorate for endorsing the #ResettingGhana agenda and believing in the vision to 'Build the Ghana We Want.'

He credited the vigilance of NDC polling agents for safeguarding the integrity of the ballot.
Mahama said his call for supporters to approach the polls with 'our own referee' effectively neutralised attempts by the Electoral Commission and the then-ruling NPP to sway the outcome.
Your vigilance turned the tide, he acknowledged.
He further commended party executives and the various campaign, strategy, operations, communications, and election management teams for designing robust pre-election strategies that ensured resilient and effective election-day operations.
Their work, he said, guaranteed that 'the voice of the people could not be silenced.'

Dr Zaato slams 'hypocritical' Majority over Kpebu's arrest,"Political science lecturer, Dr George Jebuntie Zaato, has slammed Parliament, particularly the Majority Caucus, for their hasty response to the arrest of Lawyer Martin Kpebu by the OSP last week.
Kpebu, widely believed to be sympathetic to the cause of the NDC, was detained by the OSP and was subsequently released after landed property was demanded as a condition for his release.
Kpebu's arrest immediately became topical in Parliament, with members of the NDC Majority condemning the OSP and even calling for the acts establishing the office to be repealed to disband it.
In a panel discussion on TV3's Big Issues on Saturday, Dr Zaato accused Parliament of hypocrisy for not raising a voice when the rights of other citizens were abused by the OSP and other agencies.
""When Paul (Adom-Otchere) was arrested by the OSP, nobody in Parliament got up and said that the OSP's office was being abusive. When Paul was taken away and denied his basic rights, nobody said anything,"" Dr Zaato said.
""Are we saying that some people deserve it and others don't? Where is our sense of fairness? Where is our sense of fairness as a society to say that wrong is wrong and that we shouldn't do it?""
""If your idea is that Kpebu is better than Paul and that when it happens to Paul it's okay, it's justified, but when it happens to Kpebu it is not justified, what kind of society are we building?""

Dr Zaato, who also condemned the arrest of Kpebu and the abuse of his rights, called for fairness at all times, and also urged all to stand up against the increasing spate of tyranny against citizens regardless of who is involved.
""There are two things, and I'm asking that if we are getting into these debates, let us try to be a little fair,"" he said.
""Tyranny in every form is bad. That's why I said that a threat to human rights anywhere in any form is a threat to human rights everywhere.""
